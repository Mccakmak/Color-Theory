Camp Viking – the UK commandos' new Arctic operations base,"Britain's commandos have a new Arctic operations base for the next 10 years.

Camp Viking in the north of Norway will act as a hub for Royal Marines as they perform their duties as the tip of the Arctic spear – the unit Britain turns to when it needs troops able to fight in extreme cold.

The camp, which offers modern facilities in the village of Øverbygd, about 40 miles south of Tromsø, is beside a Norwegian armed forces base and close to the established air base at Bardufoss where the Commando Helicopter Force operates.

all the waters and air space of the South China Sea. And they're doing it not
primarily with military or law enforcement vessels, they're doing it with an armed militia that camouflages itself by
operating on fishing boats. The maritime militia is really the tip of the spear for China's power projection in the South China Sea. The South China Sea is
the most contested piece of geography on the planet. The largest recent deployment
we've seen of this militia has taken place over the last seven months around Thitu Island which is occupied by about 100 Filipino civilians and a small military contingent. China has had dozens
of these militia boats surrounding the island every day. On a shot from December 20th, what you see is 95 Chinese boats. The heaviest day that we have
monitored around this feature. Every one of them are large. None of them broadcasting the
signals that they should be to avoid collisions. None of them with nets or
other gear in the water. None of them fishing. They just sit there for long
periods of time monitoring and intimidating the Filipinos. It seems clear that China's
goal in the South China Sea is to establish effective
dominance of all the waters and air space within what
they call the 9-Dash Line. They don't want to do that by
fighting a military conflict with the United States or anybody else. What they want to do
is use civilian actors, these paramilitary forces to
effectively control the space. Make it impossible for
their neighbors to operate, and therefore win without
ever having to fight. The U.S. needs to turn away from strictly military responses. The U.S. Navy has a role in
deterring outward aggression and backing up our partners. But the U.S. Navy cannot secure fishing rights for Filipinos. They can't secure law enforcement rights for their neighbors. The only thing that can
do that is a diplomatic and maybe economic effort
in trying to convince China to modify its claims and
especially its behavior to take these paramilitary
forces off the board before there's a crisis."

a Joe uprising once again failed so in 1905 in exile and Tokyo Sun yat-sen United many anti-qing groups under the leadership of his new secret society the Tong men way from America Malaysian Japan the leaders gathered many supporters many of which were officers and soldiers in China's new army who wanted to modernize China and prevent further foreign incursions but they also had the backing of local gentry who felt disenfranchised by the Ching political system and the new group of intellectuals who had studied abroad all benefit from the new domestic education system but their first attempt to start a revolution in 1910 in Guangzhou failed once again meanwhile many railway lines were being built in China largely by foreign companies the Ching started to allow local governments to build their own lines however they soon gave the right to build these lines back to foreign companies in order to make money and decrease building time this led to large-scale protests in Sichuan in august 1911 led by the railway protection mu many soldiers from nearby Wuhan were sent to help quell the protests but the revolutionaries were unprepared to take advantage of their situation however while making bombs one went off and the police investigating the explosion found a list of all the revolutionaries in the area many of which were in the army so the soldiers of the new army that had remained in Wuhan mutinied seized the government building and created the Huub a military government in early October 1911 telegrams were then dispatched to fellow revolutionaries across the country who simultaneously rose up in just a couple of months tongue men way and their allies took over cities like Shanghai Guangzhou Taiwan coming Nanjing Changsha and Chien and they also took over a lot of provinces like Wang ji and wave Fujian Guangdong Shang Gong Ning Xia chuan angry Joe many which declared their independence and the Chinese did lose out mongolia when the bog took on with the help of the russians declared mongolian independence and 13th Dalai Lama would go on to take out all Chinese officials from Tibet effectively gaining Tibetan independence as well meanwhile the Emperor Puyi was just a toddler at the time so Prince Jing who held the newly created post of Prime Minister largely governed the country he initially tried to crush the rebellions with force and had some success for instance Yuan Shikai and his Bey young army would want to defeat the rebels in Wuhan and ma Ann Liang prevented the rebels from takin CGM but Prince Jing stepped down in early November and yuan shikai became the new prime minister shortly afterwards however Nanjing fell to the rebels in early December and Sun yat-sen was made president of the new provisional Republic of China but Sonia tends to lack the military force needed to challenge Ranchi Kai's BAE young army and was fearful that a prolonged Civil War would encourage further foreign encroachment so in early 1912 with the help of foreign powers the two sides ended peace negotiations Sun yat-sen agreed to hand over control of southern China to Yuan Shikai but you an had to force Pune to abdicate and set up a republic a parliament was created but sun yat-sen's knew Kuomintang party was so successful that yuan began ignoring Parliament in persecuting opposition so a second revolution was launched against you and but this failed and in 1915 you undeclared himself the new emperor but died the following year and just before he died in 1916 military leaders in the south rebelled against him and China began to split up into small states governed by warlords soon yet Sen would eventually to China in the 1920s and trade United but this began the civil war which lasted until the 1940s

“An opportunity for American economy…”US State Department heralds mega Air India Boeing deal,"United States State Department Spokesperson on Feb 16 said that mega deal between air India and Boeing is an opportunity for American Economy. 
Addressing a Press Conference, Ned Price said, “It is something that we’ve heralded. It is an opportunity not only for the American economy & for workers here in this country, but it’s an opportunity for the Indian people as well.” “It’s an opportunity to deepen what is already a profoundly intertwined relationship based on shared interests, based on shared values, based on our deep economic ties & with the announcements between Boeing & Air India yesterday, those ties are all the deeper,” he added.

Finally, it's a better day to drive I5 in North Portland. After the big storm. It is much improved but to show there is still danger out there. Watch this car, lose it on I-84 this morning near exit 2. Snow and ice and crash. We're making real progress on the roads. We O dots, Don Hamilton says. Despite problem spots, it is much better and like a prize fighter, Oregon is making a comeback. It was a really hard hit that we took and I think we're recovering from it right now and I think just 2448 hours later and we're coming out of it. A far cry from late Wednesday into Thursday. When it was chaos and gridlock. But a lot of people who drive both Oregon and Washington tell us it's often better up in the Evergreen state, especially along I-5. Well, Portland very clearly has traffic issues. It is. It does clear up a lot as soon as you cross over. This young man doesn't blame ODOT. He just thinks there's more challenges in Oregon over Washington. Washed out, does well. I think O dot does well in a much more complicated system. Hamilton agrees with that and explains it. Further, Clark County is mostly flat and straight in Portland and the Portland area. We have a much more complicated system with a lot of bridges, a lot of flyover ramps, and a lot more Interstate highways that we have to deal with. Hamilton also says the Portland side has a lot of commercial truck traffic with lots of truck drivers not chaining up, causing huge backups like this. 825 are plowed clear and open. We also checked in with wash dot. The spokesperson says their snow load was less this time around and there are other factors. Well, I think we just had it a little bit easier. Snow levels were different. Elevation levels are different. Geography is different. So Washington, Oregon is really an apples to oranges comparison. The difference is dramatic. You hit Washington and the roads are more maintained. Sarah Tyree isn't convinced. She says her Interstate commute from Beaverton. Washington state on Wednesday was a complete nightmare. What? Yummy loaf Rd. up? I don't know. And maybe not after this experience. 7 hours a long time. Yeah, yeah it is. Yeah, maybe not now. One thing's for sure, transportation agencies in both states are appreciating the sunshine today, and they're preparing now for whatever winter brings this weekend. Guys, back to you."

Battotai - Japan Ground Self Defense Force,"Battotai can also called the Review March in the Self Defense Force.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, United States forces stationed in Japan were to deal with external aggression against Japan while Japanese forces, both ground and maritime, would deal with internal threats and natural disasters. Only after the outbreak of the Korean War did MacArthur authorise Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to establish a 75,000 strong National Police Reserve. The next expansion came in 1952, when as a compromise in the face of U.S. calls to build up an army of 350,000, the National Police Reserve was re-titled the National Safety Force and expanded to 110,000.

In 1954, Prime Minister Yoshida impelled the Diet to accept the Defence Agency Establishment and the Self-Defence Force Laws, which explicitly authorized the forces to ‘defend Japan against direct and indirect aggression, and when necessary to maintain public order.’[5] On July 1, 1954, the National Security Board was reorganized as the Defense Agency, and the National Security Force was reorganized afterwards as the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (Army), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (Navy) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (Air Force), with General Keizō Hayashi appointed as the first Chairman of Joint Staff Council—professional head of the three branches. The enabling legislation for this was the 1954 Self-Defense Forces Act [Act No. 165 of 1954].

That year the actual strength of the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defence Forces reached 146,285, armed mainly with U.S. World War II vintage equipment.[6] At least up until the 1970s, the Ground SDF was not built up to the point required to defeat an invasion attempt from the north – informed officials estimated that while ammunition provisions were officially said to be enough to last for two months, in actuality it would be used up in a week or less.",2022-05-29T00:29:05Z,UCCSqxUfbz8lRBADZjGL2h5Q,People & Blogs,194,158070,2459,0,173,2023-11-07T10:49:13.769340,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wyb28rsk4ac/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",Wyb28rsk4ac,[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you

You yang but thank still ruled over in a Mongolian and Hernan and central China was governed by the chili clique however power had been split between whoop a foo and Sun Zhongshan otherwise yang Shi Shan controlled qianxi the Muslim a clique dominated the West yang Shang Shang ruled in Ching Jiang and five war Lord continue to fight for control of sich one and the surrounding region the KMT however controlled the south and they were opposed to the walls but they were allied with nearby warlords like Tang Jia from the you nan click and their new ally Lee Jong Ren Li had gained power in Guang XI which had been semi lawless since the Guangdong Guangxi war of 1921 the KMT was initially led by Sun yat-sen and its armies were largely trained and supplied by the Soviet Union in exchange the KMT formed in the lines of the Chinese Communist Party but when son died in 1925 Tang ge I tried to take power during the u n-- and guanxi war Lee Jong Ren helped crush tank birth the Yunnan Province fell under the control of a new warlord long young otherwise a politician hwang jiae waked her control of the KMT but he was quickly outed in a coup led by general Chiang kai-shek as a nationalist hoping to remove foreign influence from China he launched the northern expedition with over a hundred thousand men in 1926 many Chinese were already angry with the Warlord's corrupt rule and constant Wars and was sympathetic to the kmt's nationalist message especially after police in the foreign settlements in Shanghai shot protesters in 1925 so thousands joined the KMT as they defeated the chief league League and captured Nanjing by March 1927 but the KMT massacred foreigners with in Nanjing in Chiang Fiat foreign intervention could jeopardize his campaign so as an anti-communist himself he blamed the Communists for this and began to purge them from his party even massacring them in Shanghai they started the Chinese Civil War and because many in the KMT were socialists to divide the party Wang Jingwei took control of the left as KMT members and formed a rival government in Wuhan but Chang quickly crushed this rival government and continued north Chiang

Chang's well-trained army so many like young sheesh and the Mackley clong young and fen you shank just decided to join Chang as he took Beijing in 1928 the Japanese were angry with Jiang for allowing the KMT to seize Beijing so harm assassinated his son Jiang Shi Liang took over Manchuria but he didn't align himself with the Japanese and instead decided to make peace with Chang effectively uniting most of China in late nineteen twenty eight but the KMT had very little control over most of China as wallowed still governed their provinces virtually independently in Manchuria Jiang unsuccessfully tried to claim back control of the railways from the Soviets and the Muslim AG League had been trying to crush Tibetan revolts in Ching hai while the KMT were aiding Muslims and Mongols to rise up against their new allies yang Zhi Shan and Feng Yue Shang this and Changsha tends to reduce provincial power caused nucleus to emerge lead Chong Ren was the first to break away from Chiang he returned to Guang XI in 1929 and formed an anti Qiang alliance with Wang Jingwei Feng Yue Shan and yang Qi Shang this led to the outbreak of the central plains war in 1930 initially Chang was surrounded but he managed to hold off attacks for a couple of months then Jung entered the war on the side of Chang and his Manchurian army saved Chang and kept him in power however hundreds of thousands were killed during the war and the region's infrastructure was devastated so with a weak army in an almost bankrupt economy Chang continued to suffer from dissension and disunity the instance he was unable to challenge the communists officially and they said a post-soviet in Jiang Shi and within the traditionally socialist KMT knew fascist cliques like the blue shirt Society began to emerge otherwise the Tibetans under the 13th Dalai Lama unsuccessfully tried to reclaim land in Shanghai during the sino-tibetan war and in the Far West Jin Xiu Ren became the new governor's and Jan and his invasion of

Battleship Texas in the dry dock below. The massive ship, which saw action in both
World War I and II, is undergoing a comprehensive restoration project to preserve its legacy
for future generations. The restoration of the Battleship Texas has
been a multi-year effort to preserve this iconic piece of American history for future
generations. The ship, which was commissioned in 1914,
has undergone various renovations over the years to maintain its structural integrity,
but this latest restoration project is the most comprehensive yet. We can see the ship's hull and decks being
repaired and upgraded as workers attend to various systems on board. One of the most important aspects of this
restoration project is the work being done to address the hull corrosion. The Battleship Texas has been in service for
nearly a century, and over time the ship's blister tanks, which were designed to protect
the ship's hull from damage, have begun to rust. This has led to significant leaks, with the
ship leak rate of over 2,000 gallons of water per minute at one point. The restoration team reduced the leak rate
to under 20 gallons per minute before it was towed to the dry deck. They have installed over 750,000 gallons of
expanded foam in the blister tanks, making the Battleship Texas significantly safer to
tow. As we continue to fly over, I am struck by
the dedication and hard work of the restoration team. They are preserving an important piece of
American history and ensuring that the Battleship Texas remains a valuable educational resource
and tourist attraction for years to come. You can see the torpedo blisters were removed
from a specific point down and will be replaced with a slightly modified design, which will
address some of the issues that have been plaguing them since 1948. The workers have been gauging the hull plating
on the aft section of the ship. The thickness of each section is then marked
and recorded, to assess how best to safely replace or repair these areas. The guns on board the Battleship Texas, were
removed as part of the restoration process. The removal of the guns was necessary for
several reasons. First, the guns were heavy and their weight
was affecting the ship's structural integrity. Second, the guns were in poor condition and
had become a safety hazard. Third, the guns required significant maintenance
and repair, which was taking resources away from other areas of the ship that needed attention. The removal of the guns was a complex and
challenging process. The guns weighed several tons each and had
to be carefully disassembled and removed to minimize the risk of damage to the ship. The restoration team worked closely with specialized
contractors to remove the guns and transport them to a secure storage facility. The restoration of the Battleship Texas is
being made possible through the support of private donors, local businesses, and the
state of Texas, who recognize the importance of preserving this iconic ship. When finished, visitors will be able to experience
the ship in a new light, as it will be open for tours and educational programs."

Business English Speakers Can Still Be Divided by a Common Language,"I'm Alex Villarreal with the VOA Special English Economics Report, from http://voaspecialenglish.com | http://facebook.com/voalearningenglish

Business is the most popular subject for international students in the United States. At last count, twenty-one percent of foreign students at American colleges and universities were studying business and management. The Institute of International Education in New York says engineering is the second most popular field, in case you were wondering.Thomas Cosse is a professor of marketing and business at the University of Richmond in Virginia. He says international students who want to study business need to have good English skills -- and not just to study at his school.But the world has more non-native speakers of English than native speakers. As a result, Americans working with foreign companies may need to learn some new English skills themselves. At the University of Richmond, teams of graduate students work with companies seeking to enter the American market.  The students learn about writing market entry studies. The reports are written in English. But Professor Cosse tells his students to consider who will read them.He said his students have to write the report so that it can be understood by someone who is an English speaker but not a native English speaker. For example, he tells his students to avoid jargon and other specialized terms that people might not know in their own language. This can be good advice even when writing for other native speakers. But effective communication involves more than just words. Kay Westerfield is director of the international business communication program at the University of Oregon. She says you must have the language skills as well as cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence means the need to consider local behaviors in everything from simple handshakes to speaking to large groups. Still, Kay Westerfield says the ability of foreign workers to speak English is becoming more important to companies looking to move operations to other countries. Or, as she puts it, to ""off-source."" Also, she says English skills often provide a competitive edge for business students when they seek jobs.  She said: ""As one business student in West Africa put it, 'English is a lifeline.'""For VOA Special English I'm Alex Villarreal.

Why is this millet eatery in Visakhapatnam so popular? | The Hindu,"Have you tried millet idlis and dosas? 

In Visakhapatnam, a growing number of people are making the switch from traditional rice batter idlis, to healthier alternatives offered by millets 

This eatery, called Vasenapoli, sees long queues every day, for its special idlis, dosas, jowar roti, millet cakes, and much more 

 The popularity of this hotel soared after the former Vice-President of India M. Venkaiah Naidu visited his stall and tweeted about it in 2021

In fact, the United Nations recently declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets.

Today on the show, we have with us the very special Cecilia Oldne. I met Cecilia for the first time 3 years ago at one of the social events we were a part of. Since then, we have exchanged so many conversations, and she has been an absolute mentor of mine when it comes to my investments and startup decisions.

Cecilia moved from Stockholm to Mumbai in 2007 to spark what is today called the Indian Wine Revolution of India’s largest wine company Sula Vineyards. During her time with Sula, she placed India on the world wine map and that's how headed the marketing for it.

In this clip, she shares her experience of living in India for more than 15 years.

portal make sure you subscribe make sure you hit that bell icon okay let me ask you this you've been here since 2007 which makes it 15 years roughly that you've been in india that's correct how much has india changed in the last 15 years from your perspective as someone who grew up in sweden versus coming here there's so many things i'm just thinking from from the time that i came in google maps was a new thing you know so even like you know traveling around was very different and you know because you know many roads doesn't necessarily even have a name to them so i think what has happened with the whole developments of tech and infrastructure has made it so much easier to to navigate in the country so i think the infrastructure what has changed in terms of i think i even also see people becoming you know more open-minded and you know being more exposed to to you know the global um opportunities yeah i do feel that uh smaller cities in india still have some catching up to do but it's okay they are catching up at a very fast rate and they almost like the urban centers the urban centers have become extremely westernized and for me the good thing is that a lot of urban indians are deciding against moving abroad which is very different even seven years back when i was in college eight years back every urban indian was thinking about settling abroad so was i until i just figured no i want to stay here and do something in the country for the country so people are coming back lots of people are uh choosing to stay here and go down that same path of like trying to build india because somewhere there is also a capitalistic intention of knowing that we have a huge population uh a huge population that's getting rapidly educated and rapidly upscaled in terms of uh spending ability so we know that there is going to be huge business opportunity in the next 10 15 20 years so this is the land to be doing your entrepreneurship right now absolutely and that's also why i'm still here but i've seen so many people as you said that were actually moving away when i first came and they're back because they realized this is the place to be and you know also like you know when i'm you know traveling around the world the country that has so much pulling power now in in regards to everything that is happening is is india so it's uh it's a exciting place okay now let's let's let's shift gears and ask you a little bit more about what it's like being a foreigner in india and i'm gonna take the liberty of knowing you personally and therefore asking a rude question pretty early on in the podcast uh how much guy attention do you get just for being a foreigner in india like from indian men but well um attention i mean maybe people do i see that they look at me because i'm blonde or do i look different you know is it guy attention or women but i think that's like it's not like necessarily men come up to me and approach me i feel i get that actually when i'm in sweden more and i don't know what that is why it is but i do feel that um maybe people are scared maybe i come across being too different but i mean obviously i see you know people look at me and they smile at me you know i smile back but you know they're gonna come and ask me for for my number or you know take me out on a date this whole like taking out you know taking me out on a date it's not really happening it's not happening in india i mean definitely not at the level that it does uh in other parts of the world really so you're saying that uh in other countries men come up more easily and at least initiate conversation but in india doesn't happen as much yeah why do you think that is no that's i don't know i'm not a psychologist but why why is it like that um i don't know what it is but you know maybe um maybe it could be that they're scared of you know i don't know is it i don't know what it potentially could be this is something that you know i'm trying to understand myself but you know i'm very open to people coming up to talk to me you know women men you know if it's an advice or anything that they want but obviously if there's a you know someone that is uh interesting you know just go for it uh maybe it's a confidence issue so like like the thing is and this i'm telling you as your friend you you exude like a lot of confidence not not negative confidence no not arrogance it's just like you're very like calm and connected and happy with yourself so i think when you see someone with that kind of confidence a lot of guys would get intimidated by any woman not just a foreigner but because you're a foreigner that intimidation just goes to another level maybe maybe [Music] you

JOINING US TODAY, CARLYLE  GROUP'S CO-FOUNDER, DAVID  RUBENSTEIN IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU THANKS FOR JOINING US TODAY. >> MY PLEASURE FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR, EVEN WHEN THE MARKET SORT OF DOUBTED IT, THAT INFLATION WOULD BE PERSISTENT. DO YOU REGARD THE LAST FEW WEEKS AS THE MARKET COMING DOWN TO WHAT CHAIR POWELL HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET ACROSS FOR MONTHS? >> I THINK THE MARKET IS FINALLY RECOGNIZING THAT INFLATION IS  NOT GOING AWAY THE FED IS RESOLUTE. THEY MADE IT CLEAR SEVERAL TIMES RECENTLY THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO GET THE RATE DOWN TO -- INFLATION RATE DOWN TO 2%, NOT 3% I THINK THE MARKET TAKES THE FED VERY SERIOUSLY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE  GOING TO HAVE A HARD LANDING OR  SO-CALLED RECESSION. IT'S TOO EARLY FOR ANYBODY TO  REALLY KNOW WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT >> DO YOU THINK THE MARKET GOT TOO EXCITED JUST OVER THE LAST,  I DON'T KNOW, FEW WEEKS AND  MONTH ABOUT A FED PAUSE AND A  FED PIVOT? YOU SPOKE TO FED CHAIR POWELL. I DON'T THINK HE SOUNDED PARTICULARLY DOVISH, DO YOU? >> I DON'T WANT TO CHARACTERIZE  IT, BUT I WOULD JUST SAY HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO GET THE INFLATIO RATE DOWN. AND I THINK THE EARLIER  EXPECTATION THAT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE RATE CUTS BIT END OF  THE YEAR, I THINK THAT'S OUT THE WINDOW BASED ON WHAT WE NOW SEE  AND WHAT HE NOW SEES CLEARLY THE MARKET COULD CHANGE, THE WORLD COULD CHANGE BASED ON WHAT THE FED SEES NOW,  I'M NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK FOR  THE FED, I DON'T THINK THE FED WILL DECREASE RATES THIS YEAR. THAT TO SOME EXTENT IS BEING REFLECTED IN THE STOCK MARKET. >> WHAT ABOUT THE DEAL ENVIRONMENT, DAVID I ALWAYS LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT  YOU'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF DEAL FLOW AND, YOU KNOW, REALLY OBVIOUSLY DRIED UP LAST YEAR 2023 LOOK DIFFERENT? >> THE MARKET IS GETTING BETTER. OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S FEWER DEALS BEING DONE THAN PEOPLE IN THE  BUSINESS WORLD WOULD LIKE, OR AT LEAST IN A DEALS WORLD I KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF DEALS IN THE WORKS AND THERE IS DEBT AVAILABLE FOR WELL-STRUCTURED  DEALS AT REASONABLE PRICES THERE IS DEBT THERE. NOT JUST FOR THE BANKS BUT FROM  OTHER LENDERS. I DO THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE DEAL  ACTIVITY IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. I JUST BELIEVE THAT THE  PRINCIPLE WE'VE HAD RECENTLY IS  PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING A  RECESSION AND, THEREFORE, BUYERS WERE RELUCTANT TO BUY INTO A RECESSION. IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THEY EXPECT A  RECESSION OR NOT, BUT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO LOWER THEIR EXPECTATION, SELLERS ARE GETTING SOMEWHAT LOWER IN WHAT THEY  WANTED TO GET FROM PRICES WHEN THEY SELL. I THINK BUYERS ARE MAYBE STEPPING UP A LITTLE MORE. I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE DEAL  ACTIVITY THE GAP BETWEEN SELLERS AND  BUYERS IS NOT AS GREAT AS IT WAS NINE MONTHS AGO OR SIX MONTHS  AGO. >> TO EXTEND THAT TO, SAY, THE EQUITIES IN THE IPO MARKET, THE  JOURNAL AND OTHERS HAVE DONE STORIES ABOUT BUDDING INTEREST IN, SAY, ONLINE GAMING AND RESTAURANTS AND EVEN SOME AREAS  OF TECH THAT MIGHT EVENTUALLY  FIND A WINDOW TO COME TO MARKET. DO YOU THINK THAT ENDS UP BEING, I DON'T KNOW, A Q2 DIEYNAMIC, A  SECOND HALF DYNAMIC? >> HARD TO SAY YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A  FAIR AMOUNT OF GROWTH CAPITAL  OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. THAT MONEY CAN BE USED TO EXTEND THE COMPANY'S STAY AS A PRIVATE  COMPANY. IT USED TO BE THAT AFTER TWO OR  THREE YEARS AS REASONABLY PROFIT COMPANY, YOU WOULD GO PUBLIC NOW YOU CAN GET MORE GROWTH  CAPITAL TO GROW YOUR COMPANY AND THE NEED TO GO PUBLIC ISN'T  QUITE WHAT IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO. I THINK IT MAY TAKE A WHILE  BEFORE YOU SEE PEOPLE COMING TO  THE MARKET AS THE PRICES THEY'RE HAPPY TO GET >> HIGHER FOR LONGER AND PRIVATE FOR LONGER, IN A SENSE.  >> WE HAVE MORE PRIVATELY OWNED  COMPANIES NOW THAN PUBLICLY  TRADED COMPANIES FOR SURE. THAT'S BECAUSE BEING IN A  PRIVATE MARKET HAS SOME APPEAL TO PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE A RUSH  OF IPOs RIGHT AWAY IT WILL TAKE A WHILE >> WHAT ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY IN  PARTICULAR, BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING MORE PUBLIC COMPANIES GO PRIVATE VIA PRIVATE EQUITY BUYOUTS THAN  ACTUAL PUBLIC IPOs IN YOUR FORECAST THAT YOU JUST GAVE, YOU EXPECT MORE DEALS THIS YEAR DOES THAT INCLUDE FROM PRIVATE EQUITY >> YES.  >> HOW MUCH OF A DRIVER? >> WHEN I TALK ABOUT DEALS, I'M  TALKING ABOUT VENTURE CAPITAL, GROWTH CAPITAL AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. IN TERMS OF COMPANIES GOING  PRIVATE, THERE'S A LOT OF APPEAL TO BEING A PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY, FOR SURE. A LOT OF LESS REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT, SO FORTH. A LOT OF CEOs, A LOT OF BOARDS ARE SAYING, WELL, MAYBE WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF TO BE PRIVATE FOR  A WHILE, FIX SOME PROBLEMS WE  HAVE OUTSIDE OF THE VIEWERSHIP OF ALL PUBLIC TRADER"

GOOD TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. ERICA, TO YOU FIRST, YOU'RE  STILL SUPER NEGATIVE AND I'M WONDERING WHAT STILL PREVENTS YOU FROM BEING POSITIVE EVEN IN INCREMENTALLY. YOU SEEM TO BE DOUBLING DOWN EVERY TIME YOU COME ON >> THERE IS NOT A LOT TO BE  POSITIVE ABOUT WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THIS NEW  FOUND VIEW THAT THE CHANCES OF A SOFT LANDING, NO LANDING, OR THE CHANCES OF RECESSION GOING DOWN, WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT VIEW COMPLETELY I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF  THE COINCIDENT INDICATORS, PAYROLL IS ONE OF THEM AND THE CURRENT STRENGTH OF THE  CONSUMER, THEY'RE DOING GREAT. LABOR MARKET REMAINS SOMEWHAT  TIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT A FORWARD LOOKING INDICATOR. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FORWARD LOOKING INDICATORS AND YOU LOOK  AT THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT WE'RE AT 3.4%, UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE, WHICH IS BY DEFINITION THE TOP OF THE CYCLE, DELAYED  REACTION TO FED HIKES TO SOME  DEGREE WHETHER SIX MONTHS OR TWO YEARS, LEADING ECONOMIC  INDICATORS FOR TEN MONTHS IN A ROW, CONSUMER EXCESS SAVINGS THEY STILL HAVE, GOING DOWN BY THE DAY, LIKELY ZERO BY THE  MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, CREDIT USAGE IS SURGING, ALL OF THAT -- ALL OF THE LEADING INDICATORS  SUGGEST THAT THE ECONOMY IS  GOING TO DECLINE THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR, AND WILL LIKELY GO INTO  SOME SORT OF RECESSION, BUT FOR  SURE WILL BE IN DECLINE. IF YOU LOOK AT PRIOR TO ALL  PRIOR RECESSIONS, PEOPLE WERE  CALLING FOR SOFT LANDING AND PAYROLLS WERE VERY STRONG. AND WE SEE THAT CHANGING AND WHAT MAKES OUR CONVICTION SO HIGH IS THAT VALUATIONS, THIS  WAS TOUCHED ON, YOU KNOW,  EARLIER, VALUATIONS NOW ARE  EXCESSIVE. THE EQUITY RISK PREMIUM IS 1.5%. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE  AVERAGE OF THE LAST 10, 20 YEARS IS 3.25% IF WE GO TO 3.2%, THAT'S 3100 IN THE S&P 500. VALUATIONS ARE EXCESSIVE AND EARNINGS ESTIMATES ARE STILL TOO HIGH >> STEPH, YOU CAN DEBATE WITH  THE BEST OF THEM SO HAVE AT IT. ERIC'S VIEW IS SO DIFFERENT FROM YOURS, IT IS STRIKING. >> WELL, YEAH. SO I AGREE THAT PAYROLLS ARE A LAGGING INDICATOR, BUT INITIAL CLAIMS ARE LEADING INDICATOR AND NOW AGAIN ANOTHER WEEK OF SUB  200,000 IN INITIAL CLAIMS. AND YOU'RE DOWN THE FOUR-WEEK  MOVING AVERAGE ABOUT OF 6% YEAR  OVER YEAR. SO, LABOR MARKETS STILL VERY TIGHT. WAGES ARE STILL STRONG EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE COMING DOWN  A LITTLE BIT, STILL STRONG SO REAL INCOMES ARE ARE ACTUALLY GOING UP FOR THE CONSUMER, AND I WOULD JUST SIMPLY POINT OUT THAT THE CONSUMER IS NOT ALL GLOOM  AND DOOM I WENT BACK AND I LOOKED AT  WALMART, KROGER, AND DOLLAR  GENERAL ON A THREE-YEAR STACK  BASIS FOR COMPS. THAT IS AN INDICATION OF DEMAND. AND WALMART SAW 24% INCREASE ON  THREE-YEAR STACK BASIS TO COMPS, KROGER AT 22%, AND DOLLAR  GENERAL UP 17% THIS IS JUST AN INDICATION OF  WHAT COMPANIES ARE TELLING US  THAT THEY'RE SEEING AND SO THE CONSUMER REMAINS STRONG, RESILIENT IS THE WORD I WOULD  USE AND THEN ALSO I WOULD LOOK AT THE ISM SERVICES AND  COMPOSITE NUMBERS, CHICAGO FEDERAL NATIONAL ACTIVITY INDEX  CAME OUT THE FIRST POSITIVE NUMBER THAT CAME OUT IN FOUR MONTHS. SO THERE IS UNDERLYING MOMENTUM, AND, YEAH, THIS IS ALSO LEADING  TO STUBBORN STICKY INFLATION AND IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE  FED'S PATH, BUT I KIND OF THINK  THE ECONOMY IS SO MUCH MORE  MOMENTUM THAN IT IS GETTING  CREDIT FOR AND I THINK THAT'S  GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO BETTER EARNINGS, NOT GREAT EARNINGS,  SCOTT. YOU KNOW THAT, BUT NOT A COLLAPSE BY ANY MEANS BECAUSE I  DO THINK OVERALL EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE EXPENSIVE  MARKET, BUT I THINK THE E IS WRONG. I THINK THE E IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN PEOPLE SUGGEST.  >> IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE TOO  NEGATIVE YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING ON ANY OF  THE POSITIVE, YOU JUST ASSUME  THE FED HAS DONE A LOT AND IT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE A TOLL  ON THE ECONOMY, AND THE CONSUMER WHO IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY, AND DELINQUENCIES WILL  PICK UP EVEN MORE THAN THEY  ALREADY HAVE ON CREDIT CARDS AND THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING TO COME EVENTUALLY TO AN END. >> SO WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT OUR VIEW IS THAT EVEN IF EARNINGS  DON'T GO DOWN AT ALL, THE MARKET IS STILL OVERVALUED AT THIS  PRICE, IF WE HAVE THIS GREAT PERFECT LANDING, PERFECT LANDING, GROWTH, INFLATION COMES DOWN, FED STOPS HIKING, STOCKS ARE STILL TOO EXPENSIVE, AND WILL LIKELY MOVE LOWER, NOW, HERE'S WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU AROUND EARNINGS. ON OCTOBER 1st, OKAY, OF LAST  YEAR, THE ESTIMATE FOR THE NEXT  12 MONTHS WAS $235 WE HAVE NOW HAD 2.5% GDP IN THE  FOURTH QUARTER, WE'RE LOOKING  LIKE 2%, 2.5% IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND THE EARNIN"

GOOD TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. ERICA, TO YOU FIRST, YOU'RE  STILL SUPER NEGATIVE AND I'M WONDERING WHAT STILL PREVENTS YOU FROM BEING POSITIVE EVEN IN INCREMENTALLY. YOU SEEM TO BE DOUBLING DOWN EVERY TIME YOU COME ON >> THERE IS NOT A LOT TO BE  POSITIVE ABOUT WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THIS NEW  FOUND VIEW THAT THE CHANCES OF A SOFT LANDING, NO LANDING, OR THE CHANCES OF RECESSION GOING DOWN, WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT VIEW COMPLETELY I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF  THE COINCIDENT INDICATORS, PAYROLL IS ONE OF THEM AND THE CURRENT STRENGTH OF THE  CONSUMER, THEY'RE DOING GREAT. LABOR MARKET REMAINS SOMEWHAT  TIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT A FORWARD LOOKING INDICATOR. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FORWARD LOOKING INDICATORS AND YOU LOOK  AT THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT WE'RE AT 3.4%, UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE, WHICH IS BY DEFINITION THE TOP OF THE CYCLE, DELAYED  REACTION TO FED HIKES TO SOME  DEGREE WHETHER SIX MONTHS OR TWO YEARS, LEADING ECONOMIC  INDICATORS FOR TEN MONTHS IN A ROW, CONSUMER EXCESS SAVINGS THEY STILL HAVE, GOING DOWN BY THE DAY, LIKELY ZERO BY THE  MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, CREDIT USAGE IS SURGING, ALL OF THAT -- ALL OF THE LEADING INDICATORS  SUGGEST THAT THE ECONOMY IS  GOING TO DECLINE THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR, AND WILL LIKELY GO INTO  SOME SORT OF RECESSION, BUT FOR  SURE WILL BE IN DECLINE. IF YOU LOOK AT PRIOR TO ALL  PRIOR RECESSIONS, PEOPLE WERE  CALLING FOR SOFT LANDING AND PAYROLLS WERE VERY STRONG. AND WE SEE THAT CHANGING AND WHAT MAKES OUR CONVICTION SO HIGH IS THAT VALUATIONS, THIS  WAS TOUCHED ON, YOU KNOW,  EARLIER, VALUATIONS NOW ARE  EXCESSIVE. THE EQUITY RISK PREMIUM IS 1.5%. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE  AVERAGE OF THE LAST 10, 20 YEARS IS 3.25% IF WE GO TO 3.2%, THAT'S 3100 IN THE S&P 500. VALUATIONS ARE EXCESSIVE AND EARNINGS ESTIMATES ARE STILL TOO HIGH >> STEPH, YOU CAN DEBATE WITH  THE BEST OF THEM SO HAVE AT IT. ERIC'S VIEW IS SO DIFFERENT FROM YOURS, IT IS STRIKING. >> WELL, YEAH. SO I AGREE THAT PAYROLLS ARE A LAGGING INDICATOR, BUT INITIAL CLAIMS ARE LEADING INDICATOR AND NOW AGAIN ANOTHER WEEK OF SUB  200,000 IN INITIAL CLAIMS. AND YOU'RE DOWN THE FOUR-WEEK  MOVING AVERAGE ABOUT OF 6% YEAR  OVER YEAR. SO, LABOR MARKETS STILL VERY TIGHT. WAGES ARE STILL STRONG EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE COMING DOWN  A LITTLE BIT, STILL STRONG SO REAL INCOMES ARE ARE ACTUALLY GOING UP FOR THE CONSUMER, AND I WOULD JUST SIMPLY POINT OUT THAT THE CONSUMER IS NOT ALL GLOOM  AND DOOM I WENT BACK AND I LOOKED AT  WALMART, KROGER, AND DOLLAR  GENERAL ON A THREE-YEAR STACK  BASIS FOR COMPS. THAT IS AN INDICATION OF DEMAND. AND WALMART SAW 24% INCREASE ON  THREE-YEAR STACK BASIS TO COMPS, KROGER AT 22%, AND DOLLAR  GENERAL UP 17% THIS IS JUST AN INDICATION OF  WHAT COMPANIES ARE TELLING US  THAT THEY'RE SEEING AND SO THE CONSUMER REMAINS STRONG, RESILIENT IS THE WORD I WOULD  USE AND THEN ALSO I WOULD LOOK AT THE ISM SERVICES AND  COMPOSITE NUMBERS, CHICAGO FEDERAL NATIONAL ACTIVITY INDEX  CAME OUT THE FIRST POSITIVE NUMBER THAT CAME OUT IN FOUR MONTHS. SO THERE IS UNDERLYING MOMENTUM, AND, YEAH, THIS IS ALSO LEADING  TO STUBBORN STICKY INFLATION AND IT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE  FED'S PATH, BUT I KIND OF THINK  THE ECONOMY IS SO MUCH MORE  MOMENTUM THAN IT IS GETTING  CREDIT FOR AND I THINK THAT'S  GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO BETTER EARNINGS, NOT GREAT EARNINGS,  SCOTT. YOU KNOW THAT, BUT NOT A COLLAPSE BY ANY MEANS BECAUSE I  DO THINK OVERALL EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE EXPENSIVE  MARKET, BUT I THINK THE E IS WRONG. I THINK THE E IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN PEOPLE SUGGEST.  >> IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE TOO  NEGATIVE YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING ON ANY OF  THE POSITIVE, YOU JUST ASSUME  THE FED HAS DONE A LOT AND IT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE A TOLL  ON THE ECONOMY, AND THE CONSUMER WHO IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY, AND DELINQUENCIES WILL  PICK UP EVEN MORE THAN THEY  ALREADY HAVE ON CREDIT CARDS AND THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING TO COME EVENTUALLY TO AN END. >> SO WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT OUR VIEW IS THAT EVEN IF EARNINGS  DON'T GO DOWN AT ALL, THE MARKET IS STILL OVERVALUED AT THIS  PRICE, IF WE HAVE THIS GREAT PERFECT LANDING, PERFECT LANDING, GROWTH, INFLATION COMES DOWN, FED STOPS HIKING, STOCKS ARE STILL TOO EXPENSIVE, AND WILL LIKELY MOVE LOWER, NOW, HERE'S WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU AROUND EARNINGS. ON OCTOBER 1st, OKAY, OF LAST  YEAR, THE ESTIMATE FOR THE NEXT  12 MONTHS WAS $235 WE HAVE NOW HAD 2.5% GDP IN THE  FOURTH QUARTER, WE'RE LOOKING  LIKE 2%, 2.5% IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND THE EARNIN"

the middle of the 17th century the many Mongol groups were largely united ANDed independent states the orap mongols largely formed the jungle Carnot and the calchas Buryats and many others formed the northern Yuan Dynasty however the cha has until the Mongols had been invaded by the church and who would go on to invade China and create the Ching dynasty this land in the south would go on to form what is now Inner Mongolia whereas Outer Mongolia was invaded at the end of the 17th century and the jungles were largely annihilated in the 18th century and Mongolian influence in the region was lost Mongolian land was divided into different regions with their own nobility and were guaranteed some autonomy Han Chinese were initially banned from living in Mongolia but in the 19th century many began to settle in Inner Mongolia illegally but numerous unsuccessful Wars rebellions and famines in the late 19th century in China caused the Ching dynasty to request taxes be paid in silver this crippled the Mongolian economy because they needed to take out loans from Chinese lenders to pay it plus in the early 20th century the Ching dynasty as part of their new policies tried to colonize Mongolia by saddling Han Chinese in the region this was a response to Russian expansion in northern China the russians had settled people in the far east and took old chinese territory north of the Amur around 1860 first they moved troops into Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion and annexed the Liao Tong Peninsula and in Mongolia they began settling and Tuva in large numbers however Han immigration angered the Mongols so when a qing appointed official was sent to implement the new reforms in 1910 small-scale fighting broke out between the mongols and chinese Kalka nobles began to call for independence with the bog deconned leader of mongolian buddhists as their head of state and even sent a delegation to russia to request aid but just a year later in 1911 Chinese revolutionaries rose up against the Qing Dynasty many of which declared independence for the respective provinces this allowed the Mongolians to declare independence from China without much opposition however the Russian sent troops into Tuva and turned it into a protectorate and any Mongolians ruling over more Han Chinese chose to remain under Chinese rule the new theocratic Mongolian state however lost any potential support from Russia with the outbreak of World War one so the Russian signed the treaty with China which made Mongolia an autonomous region under his rule then in 1917 Mongolia quickly became involved in the Russian Civil War early at mongols living within Russia from the short-lived state of Berea Mongolia and in its capital Cheeta a pan Mongolian conference was held this was initially supported by the Japanese who wanted to create a buffer state in between them and the Bolsheviks and led by the likes for the White Army General Grigory seminoff the pan Mongols hoped to create a state that would unite the buryat state outer in Inner Mongolia sing Jan and even Tibet but this pan Mongol state may have removed the bog to confirm power so the nobility appealed to the Chinese for help in 1919 power in China at that time had been divided between competing warlords but duan Curie and his aunt Wakely controlled beijing and after taking out loans from japan he was very much under their influence plus by late 1919 the Bolsheviks were rapidly pushing East in Russia and the Japanese were worried about them moving into Mongolia so they somewhat pressured one into offering help to the bog diccon and 14,000 troops quickly occupied Mongolia ending its autonomy however this was opposed by many and some like dustman Buddha choy Paulson and sukhbaatar from the Communist Mongolian People's Party but in Russia in late 1920 in monarchists and white army general roman van egmond Sternberg formed an army of Buryats Tartars and other ethnicities and invaded mongolia the chinese man should fight back his first invasion but he invaded again in February 1921 forced the Chinese out of her modern-day ulaanbataar and restored the bog to come to power this however got the Bolsheviks to send weapons to the Mongolian People's Party and sukhbaatar led an army of a few hundred guerrillas a Red Army expeditionary force was sent to the border in crush Holland Sternberg's counter-attack and entered a ger in July 19-21 although the Soviets formed the Tuvans People's Republic in the north they didn't install a communist leader in Mongolia because they still hope to repair their relations with China instead the bog Diccon ruled as a constitutional Manik but who was made Prime Minister but his policy of forcibly curtain off feudal objects like jewelry forced him to resign and soup Rita died in 1923 however in 1924 the bhakti Kahn died and the Mongolians People's Party declared no reincarnation to will be accepted and took power the Mongolians People's Republic was declared fully independent but over time especially under Stalin Soviets began to assert more authority in the region under the 1930s Charlie parson who has been dubbed the Mongolian Stalin took power and began to implement Stalinist policies and even purge thousands of people so it became a sort of Soviet puppet state but the Chinese still claimed Mongolia for decades [Music]"

However China lost both Mongolia and Tibet and thousands of Bai Lang bandits pillaged the countryside. And, as the Qing dynasty fell apart Generals and even bandit leaders seized provincial and asserted their autonomy. And these became the warlords. Sun Yat-Sens Kuomintang, the party who largely led the revolution, made many concessions in the establishment of the Republic. But the KMT leader in the new Assembly, Song Jiaoren, still won the elections in 1913 after campaigning to reduce to the powers of the Presidency. He was however was assassinated shortly afterwards, causing many in KMT strongholds in the South to rise up against Yuan. This, the second revolution, however was quickly and the KMT was banned. Yuan, now looking for international support, took out foreign loans, and agreed to give Japan more concessions as part of the 21 demands. All of which angered his nationalistic Generals. Then, in 1915, he crowned himself Emperor, encouraging a Clique of Generals in Yunnan to declare independence, starting the National Protection War in December. Yuans armies were defeated and Generals across Southern China joined the uprising, so he agreed to restore the Republic just before dying. Li Yuanhong was made the new President, but, he fell out with his Prime Minister, Duan Qirui, over China’s entry into WW1. And as Beijing became divided, one General, Zhang Xun, marched into Beijing with the deposed Puyi Emperor in July 1917, hoping to restore the Monarchy. Zhangs armies were defeated but Li still resigned, allowing Duan to rule alongside Li’s Vice President, Feng Guozhang. However Sun Yat-Sen arrived back in the South and, alongside Southern Warlords who had previously opposed Yuan Shikai, like Tang Jiyao, established a rival government, starting the Constitutional Protection movement. Duan favoured crushing the KMT militarily, but Feng favoured diplomacy. So the 2 split and, now fearful of one another, formed cliques with allied officers and bureaucrats. Feng formed the Zhili Clique and Duan the Anhui Clique, which was backed by Japan. But many Generals remained neutral, like Zhang Zhoulin’s Fengtian Clique in Manchuria, and there was the Muslim Ma Clique, Yang Zengxin in Xinjiang, Yan Xishan in Shanxi and many minor ones in provinces like Sichuan, which was being fought over by numerous warlords. The new President in Beijing, Xu Shichang, remained neutral and but had very little power. But in 1918 many turned against Duan when his expeditions South proved a failure. And he recognised Japans acquisition of German concessions and used Japanese loans to reoccupy Mongolia. The subsequent anti-Japanese May the 4th Movement, saw thousands protest and helped create the Chinese Communist Party. So, taking advantage of this, Cao Kun, the new leader of the Zhili Clique, forged an alliance with Zhang’s Fengtian Clique and attacked. In July 1920, after the 9 day long Anhui-Zhili war, the allies took Beijing and divided power in the City. The Anhui survived, because no faction had the military capacity or will to fight a prolonged war. So boundaries kept changing, but because the rulers of Beijing got international recognition, this was the main target. Meanwhile, in the South Sun Yat-Sen fell out with his old ally, Lu Rongting, over his peace talks with the Zhili Clique. So Sun raised and army and, during the subsequent Guangdong-Guangxi war, forced Lu out of Guangzhou and temporarily occupied Guangxi in mid-1921. And, in Beijing, the Fengtian and Zhili Cliques, fell out with one another when the politicians installed by Zhang were removed from parliament. So, Zhang, now with Japanese support, tried to take Beijing in April 1922, but failed and Caos Zhili Clique achieved complete control of the capital. Cao tried, but failed to make peace with Sun Yat-Sen. So he encouraged one of Sun’s Generals, Chen Jiongming, to switch sides and chase Sun out of China. Chen however was toppled by Tang Jiyao a year later, keeping the South under KMT control. The KMT, who had been receiving aid from Japanese groups, then began receiving aid from the Soviet Union and formed the First United Front alongside the small Communist Party of China. Cao meanwhile, had support from the West and made a new Constitution, but, in 1924, Zhang attacked again. Zhang's now well-funded armies overwhelmed the Zhili, but before he could take Beijing, one of Cao’s Generals, Feng Yuxian, seized power in a coup. Feng ended the war and agreed to make Duan President again. Plus, as a Christian and socialist, he was sympathetic to the KMT, but Sun Yat-Sen died before any unification agreements could be made. Then in November 1925 Feng persuaded a Manchurian General to switch allegiances, so Zhang responded by invading again. The Zhili Clique had divided by this point between Sun Chuanfang and Wu Peifu. But Wu agreed to help Zhang take Beijing in early 1926 and drove Feng West. But the warlords wars had damaged the economy and many sold opium and raised taxes to fund their wars and lavish lifestyles. So many joined the Communists and KMT and the KMT found found a new ally, Li Zongren in Guangxi. But, since Sun Yat-Sen's death the KMT was divided and it were only able to go on the offensive after Chiang Kai Shek took power in a coup."

Farmer finds old Bitcoins and buys Mercedes SUV,"Henrik Koch from Helsinge experienced it all dreaming of: He spent 100 kroner in 2011. Shortly before Christmas, his investment had risen to more than a million.

Back then, Bitcoins were a new phenomenon.But could make them even - it's called ""my"" Bitcoins.This was done by connecting your computer to a large system where a lot of computers jointly calculated complicated maths.

- When I had a nice gaming computer at home, I started a graphics card with that task, he tells TV 2 Lorry.

He mined a total of 12 bitcoins - it cost him about 100 kroner in power.Somewhat the same as they were worth, but they were impossible to use in Denmark.

- So I just shrugged my shoulders and said it's a lot of fun to have, I leave them lying.

When Henrik came to mind about his ""mining project"" the value of a single bitcoins had increased from 10 kroner to almost 130,000.But unfortunately the computer was long since scrapped.

- But as the farmer I am, I never throw out anything.So the old disks from the scrapped computer were just behind, says Henrik Koch, pointing into the closet where his current computer is.",2018-02-06T12:29:02Z,UCLxs4arZs46ZBsZ6VvDRkTw,People & Blogs,249,493964,2820,0,241,2023-11-07T10:49:17.445042,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uQJldt1taWo/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,uQJldt1taWo,"Hello!For the past three years, Henrik Cox has ..."

will you stand there, please? And Aske. Thomas, you and your family
live in a lovely house - - at Vinkelhøj 8 in Viby. Before you moved there,
it was your childhood home, Aske. That's correct. Soccer in the garden. I can imagine.
We do it all the time. - Mathilde, please come forward.
- Hi. The two of you
have been facing each other before. But you were 12 years old.
And it was in a rugby match. And by the way,
Aske's team beat your team by 42-0. Thanks for a good match. Inger. Mathilde, the night you were born

your husband is out jogging. Suddenly, he collapses
and has a heart attack. Luckily, someone reacts promptly
and saves him. Knud, please come forward. Thanks. So good to meet you. Just below the surface, a total stranger can turn out to be someone you’re actually connected to. It's been a while. Someone who rouses forgotten memories. Really? Like the very first kiss. Someone who reminds you that you're not alone. But that somebody else also has
a bulldog named Preben. Someone like the firefighter Thomas who put out a fire at Vibeke's place. We're so thankful
that the fire brigade came right away. Someone you’ve been gaming with for years, but … - Do you know each other? … have never met. - No. - 'Altamon' meet 'Lil Salt'. - No way! You're the topfragger! We've known each other for
three-four years without ever meeting. If we approach each other, we might find out that we share the same destiny. Rana and Maher, you came to Denmark
from Syria four years ago. Dorrit and Jan, you have
a similar story from World War II. I tried living as a refugee. And I will never forget it. It has meant everything. And Rikke. It was your great-grandfather
who risked his life - - by sailing Jan to Sweden
that night in October 1943. It’s easy to mind your own business. It takes a little more effort to mind the community. But doesn’t the feeling of having something in common, - - something that connects us, make it all worthwhile? TV 2 – All that we share"

A LAIG ELECTION CAMP - the best moments,"The 2019 election campaign is over, and with its 29 days it is the longest in Denmark for 44 years.

It has offered several surprises and memorable moments.From three new eligible parties: Stram Course, New Civil and Klaus Riskær Pedersen, to Lars Løkke Rasmussen's hand over the middle to Mette Frederiksen, to 'Gokke-Jokke', food poisonings and other more or less unpredictable things.

We've cooked the long election campaign down to the very best moments.

"Building where teen died in elevator skipped fixes to save money, whistleblower says","In Aug. 2021, 18-year-old JaMarcus McFarland died in an elevator malfunction at a mixed-use building called 444 Highland in Old Fourth Ward.",2023-02-23T13:37:51Z,UCzF4Ryn8TKn64md77gS5Q5Q,News & Politics,228,58824,998,0,286,2023-11-07T10:49:19.426812,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oa1706liWBc/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,Oa1706liWBc,"Than 800 elevators are overdue for inspection in Atlanta alone. This was, according to state documents, obtained by 11 alive and investigators. But for some, it's way too late. In 2021, a teenager died during an elevator malfunction in the old 4th Ward. Remember that story? And now a whistleblower has come forward with evidence that the building owners knew it was unsafe. He spoke exclusively with our Savannah Levins, who joins us now with the story that whistleblower provided me with documents. Knowing that, he was assigned to make repairs to the elevator, but tells me management refused because it was too expensive. That likely cost Jamarcus McFarland his life and may point to a bigger problem in our buildings. You wanna help, you have to go back. Body camera video shows firefighters attempting to rescue 18 year old Jamarcus McFarland from a malfunctioning elevator in this Highland Ave. building. Other riders escape as it drops, but McFarland became pinned between the top of the elevator and the floor. He died after an hour long attempt to save him. This is a tragic loss because we lost a good young man who had a bright, bright future. Attorney Sean Williams is representing the McFarland family in a lawsuit against the building's management saying that elevator was overdue for inspection. The owners of this building knew about this dangerous condition and had every opportunity prevented, so it just makes it even double worse. You lost your child, but it was preventable and now a whistleblower is coming forward saying the owners skipped. Fixes to save money. There have been no maintenance done whatsoever. The contractor asked that we protect his identity, but provided evidence showing he'd warned management the elevators were a life safety risk. And what was the response to that? Basically, no. Can you get more quotes so we can shop this around? I don't want to spend that type of money for this. You know, we can get it done cheaper. I emphatically told them that this is not something we can we have time to play with. This is something that has to be done. And done immediately. It's not something you can shop around. And while the repairs were being delayed, Jamarcus was killed. It was very, very tragic, but it was very, very preventable. There's no way to put a price on a life. And I think that's what was done. And what your whistleblower shows and proves is they made a conscious decision to save cost over the lives of people. We made numerous attempts over several weeks to contact the building management and owners, but never heard back. Williams says the McFarland family hopes to see real change come from this tragedy. We have millions of people every day in this state riding elevators, and if you don't make sure they're maintained in a proper way, this unfortunate situation can can come to somebody else's family and life. In Georgia, the fine for failing to keep an elevator inspection up to date is $500.00, which is nothing. You know, what's that life worth. Elevator operators have to request those annual inspections. It's not automatic. We uncovered 825 elevators in Atlanta alone are past due. There are codes in place to prevent this. But they just need to be enforced. We take a risk every time we're on the elevator. Our job on behalf of this family is to get them justice. Get your mark as justice, make sure his legacy live on, but to make sure that this doesn't happen to anybody else. We've learned a bill was previously introduced in Georgia to crack down on overdue inspections, including raising the fine from 500 to $2500, but it did not pass. We just reached out to the sponsors to ask if they plan to propose something similar again, but have not yet heard back. We'll keep you updated."

Alright Henry. Thank you for that, and avalanche in Olympic Valley near the Palisades Tahoe ski resort came crashing down on some apartments early last night . Nobody was injured, but it has Tahoe region. On high alert KTVU Tom Baker's studio with the latest on the Avalanche and all the snow this era has been hit with this year, Tom, Let's put it this way. We have not seen this kind of snow since Richard Nixon was in the White House. About seven PM Tuesday. A huge 200 ft Wide 25 FT tall Avalanche hit a three story apartment building in Olympic Valley near Palisades Ski Resort, burying two floors with fortunately no casualties. Z Bo was in the building next door down the mountain on the other side of the Palisades Lodge or this often in #### Valley Lodge. Um there is a you know, a bunch of condos back there and you know older apartments. We've had high avalanche danger for the last several days and today's forecast its considerable, which is a step below. At Sugar Bowl. This wall of snow picture speaks 1000 words basically slide down a slide. To get to the other door. There's a little air hole there and then dug it out and then got in Berkeley Sierra Snow Lab reports that California is experiencing the snowiest October through February since 1970 more than a half century going forward, it just looks like those numbers are going to increase, and that's going to help us not only with short term drought, but hopefully with the long term drought as well. The Department of Water Resources, remote sensing network reporting from 100 locations is made of large, high tech electronic scales, which report 24 7. As of March. 1st. The network shows the Sierra snowpack in the Northern California section is 150% of normal for the state 191% in the central zone and a whopping 224% in the southern zone. That 40 Ft of Snow already up there will melt into more than four FT. Of water and Morris coming But early warm weather or warm rain could cause floods. But so far, temperatures up there have been very, very low, keeping it mostly frozen at the snow lab. We've seen temperatures on average during the day in the low to mid twenties. Recently on New Year's Day, the state's sixth largest mega reservoirs were 36% full. Too wet months later, they are 61% full and enormous positive gain, but not the 86% They would historically have been at. It's unlikely that we're going to completely in the drought with a single good season. We're going to need two or three of these consecutive years with above average conditions. So great for the reservoirs but recharging those underground aquifers. That's the majority of our supply, and that's going to take at least that long, if not longer. Tom Baker KTVU fought two names, Tom, Thank you and coming up in this newscast will sit down with a senior avalanche"

"U.S. and China increase military deployments in South China Sea, as tensions rise","With President Trump''s tough stance on the legality of China''s claims to the South China Sea, military tensions between the two superpowers are brewing. On Friday, satellite imagery revealed an unprecedented eight Chinese PLA air-to-air and air-to-ship fighter jets on one of the Paracel Islands. The U.S. military has also confirmed that two long-range supersonic B-1B Lancers took off from the U.S. mainland for repositioning in Guam. The U.S. claims to be protecting its allies in the region, but its message for China is clear.

Two days ago, two U.S. carrier groups performed an exercise in the South China Sea, while on Friday satellite imagery revealed a bird''s eye view of Chinese air force deployments on Woody Island.  

On the island''s airstrip, eight Chinese jets could be seen lined up in a row. Foreign media have continually reposted the photographs, commenting that this was the first time for such a large contingent to be seen on the island. 

Smith Chen
Defense analyst
It''s true that the configuration of this deployment is totally different from what we have seen in the past. Fighter jets are deployed to maintain air superiority. Attack aircraft or bombers are used for anti-ship attacks and bombing missions. The Chinese navy and air force must be considering whether permanently stationing these aircraft on the island are worth the logistics costs. If not, they will likely use troop rotations to establish its presence on the island installation

Experts still do not rule out that China may make these kinds of deployments part of its regular operations in the region.  Its goal is nothing less than that of challenging the U.S. and gaining sovereignty over the sea. 

Websites devoted to exposing flight movements were replete with images on July 18 of two B-1B Lancers, long-range multi-mission supersonic conventional bombers, taking off  from a base in South Dakota, crossing the Pacific Ocean and landing in Guam for stationing, bringing the number of B-1Bs in Guam''s Anderson Air Force Base to four. The Indo-Pacific Command confirmed that this deployment was aimed at fulfilling U.S. defense commitments to its allies. These remarks were clearly aimed at China. 

Smith Chen
Defense analyst
China often says that they have their so-called Xian H-6 Strategic Bomber that, when coupled with CJ-10 cruise missiles, can threaten Guam. If China uses its fighter jets in the South China Sea region for harassment or to fly more often to the region than before, the U.S. aircraft repositioning will make it able to reach the South China Sea more quickly. Whether it''s utilizing its so-called Aegis Combat System or having B-1Bs depart from Guam, they can all reach the South China Sea region rapidly and this kind of operational flexibility will actually increase pressure on China.

"“It’s Modi Doctrine…,” EAM Jaishankar credits Prime Minister for India’s foreign policy shift","During the inaugural session of the Asia Economic Dialogue 2023, India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar was hailed for India’s foreign policy, however, he credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for country’s strong diplomacy. When former Indian Ambassador Gautam Bambawale termed S Jaishankar as a rockstar for new brand of India’s foreign policy, External Affairs Minister was quick to credit his boss (PM Modi) for shift in policy.

So what that entails is that I do primary care medicine for our flyers, in addition to other special duty personnel. My job in the Air Force is being a dedicated crew chief. That means I'm in charge of all the maintenance for the jets. Making sure that these are all airworthy. So I am a flight systems supervisor. And basically, I manage and maintain a lot of the computers down there. I love being in the Air Force because there's so many opportunities. Originally born from San Fernando, Pampanga. So I was originally born in the Philippines, in an area called Cavite. I actually grew up here in the Philippines, I grew up in Bicol. I get to eat the local food again. I know back in Guam there's a lot of Filipinos, but actually being here, where I was born, and eating the food they have around here, it's pretty great. So I'm pretty happy about it. The Philippines, for me, is very nostalgic. For one, even though I grew up in Tennessee where we have four seasons, it's almost like it's in my genes to really enjoy the warm weather
all year long. I fit in. I love the heat, you know? Like back at home station, back in Misawa, Japan, it's like all snowy. It's actually snowing there right now. So I'm loving it. The food is great, the people are great, I can speak the language, so I'm loving it. I'm, after this TDY (temporary duty), gonna go see my family for a reunion. I haven't seen them in over ten years, and there are 56 of them that are waiting to come greet me. So, I think for all those reasons, I really love the Philippines. Being back here in the Philippines, you always have to look back where you came from, and it's a good experience. If you know that your family is from---whether it be the Philippines or Europe, or wherever it may be, like really dig into it and learn more about it, because I think that, you know, there's something within all of us that we're probably missing out on. So I highly encourage you to just jump in there and learn more about it. Whether it be by reading or going out to that country, or eating the food,
whatever way you think you can get connected. In Tagalog, I just want to say, ""Salamat (Thank you)"" and, ""Mabuhay (Long live) Filipino."""

THEY ARE PRETENDING TO HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY I'M JADED JUST ENOUGH AND LIVE. FAR ENOUGH OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THEN I LOOK AT IT AS AN ABSURDITY. IT WILL NOT EVER BE A SUBPOENA THAT THEY SEND TO THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT WILL BE RESPONDED TO IN ANY WAY. NOT FOR DOCUMENTS NOT FOR TESTIMONY NOT FOR ANYTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WILL HAPPEN BY WHAT THEY ARE DOING. BUT THAT IS MY VIEW OF IT. I DO AGREE IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE NOTION OF THE IDEAL OF WHAT THESE COMMITTEES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO IN FRONT OF AMERICANS TO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW WILD AND OUT OF CONTROL, THIS BEHAVIOR IS >> IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUCH A BASELINE AND TO HELP SHARE WITH THE COUNTRY JUST ARE DANGEROUS AND ABSURD TO SERVICE JUST HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE TRUMP PLAYBOOK OF INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS DISCREDIT THE INVESTIGATION WHEN THERE IS A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF A CRIMINAL OR POTENTIAL CRIMINAL AND HE IS A MEMBER OF THEIR PARTY OR PARTY LEADER. IT IS IN THEIR VIEW BY DEFINITION SOMEHOW ILLEGITIMATE. THAT'S NOT HOW THE RULE OF LAW WORKS. IF WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS WE CAN HAVE NO RESPECT OR A PERSON'S. THIS MEANS THE LAW HAS TO APPLY EQUALLY TO ANYONE WHAT THEY REALLY WANT IS AN UNEQUAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW. THEY WANT IMMUNITY FOR THEIR PARTY LEADER. THEY ARE POSITING WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW A POLITICAL PROSECUTION THEY DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE WITNESSES TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY, AND LOOK IS THE MANHATTAN GRAND JURY BELIEVES THAT THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP COMMITTED A CRIME AND PROSECUTORS BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN PROVE THAT CRIME, IT IS THEIR OBLIGATION TO GO FORWARD. ONE THING WE HAVE SEEN WITH DONALD TRUMP IS THAT IF YOU DO NOT HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE HE WILL GO ON TO DO WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. IT'S A DANGEROUS IDEA AND THE ABSTRACT IT'S MORE DANGEROUS IN THE CONCRETE CASE OF DONALD TRUMP ESPECIALLY TO SET A DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS. THE STORMY DANIELS CASE IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IF NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE HE WILL DO WORSE. YOU CAN SHOW ON THE CALENDAR OF DONALD TRUMP'S LIFE THAT AFTER HE PAID OFF STORMY DANIELS HE DID INDEED GO ON TO DO WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AFTER MICHAEL COHEN WAS PROSECUTED DURING THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY FOR THOSE CRIMES AND DONALD TRUMP NEVER FACED ANY CONSEQUENCES. NO CENSURE FROM CONGRESS NO IMPEACHMENT PROCESS OVER THAT ISSUE HE THEN WENT ON TO DO WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE, INVOLVING BLACK NOW WITH UKRAINE, AND OF COURSE, THE JANUARY 6TH INSURRECTION. >> THERE IS NOTHING WORSE YOU CAN DO FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NO ETHICAL COMPASS THEN LEAVE THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH DONALD TRUMP. HIS ENTIRE LIFE BUT NOW THOSE HAVE ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES. IF IT SHOULD BE THAT HE GETS THE IMPRESSION OR THAT OTHERS IN POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT BY VIRTUE OF THEIR POSITION THEY CAN LIE WITH IMPUNITY, AND LIE ABOUT HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS OR LIE ABOUT THE RETENTION OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS LYING ABOUT COERCING A NATION TO SMEAR YOUR OPPONENT, THEY CAN LIE ABOUT ELECTIONS, AND CAUSE VIOLENT ATTACKS ON THE CAPITOL THERE IS NO END."

ALL RIGHT, STEPHEN. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO THE WEST. WE'VE GOT THAT ATMOSPHERIC RIVER BARRELING INTO CALIFORNIA . IT IS DROPPING HEAVY RAIN AND HEAVY SNOW, AND THAT'S AS A RECORD BREAKING WINTER INUNDATED THE GOLDEN STATE WITH FLOODING, EXCESSIVE SNOWFALL AND MUDSLIDES. IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM TODAY . THEY'VE SEEN IT ALL, I GUESS DESPITE THE PLAGUE OF FROGS AND LOCUSTS, AS ONE PERSON HAD SAID THE STORM IS NOW PUSHING SOME CALIFORNIA RIVERS BEYOND THE FLOOD STAGE. AND AT INCLUDES WHAT'S GOING ON IN AND ALONG THE CURRENT RIVER. AS YOU CAN SEE THAT VIDEO JUST HOW QUICKLY IT'S RUSHING THESE RIVERS BECOMING QUICKLY SWOLLEN. WE DO WANT TO BRING IN KERN VILLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CURRENT RIVER CONSERVANCY, GARY, A NANNY IN WE APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I MEAN BEFORE. LET'S JUST START WITH THE VIEW. I SEE THE CURRENT RIVER BEHIND YOU, AND IT DOES LOOK SWOLLEN AND VERY ELEVATED HIGHER THAN IT SHOULD BE. YEAH DEFINITELY. IT'S DIDN'T COMPLETE FLOOD STAGE AT THE MOMENT. RIGHT NOW IT'S RUNNING AT ABOUT 45,000 CFS, UM, WAY ABOVE ITS NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR, THE RIVER SHOULD BE ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM 3 TO 400 CFS FOR NORMAL TIME. WOULD YOU SAY, GARY ? THIS IS A PART OF THE SNOWMELT THAT'S OCCURRING IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS . I MEAN, WORKING WITH AND ALONG THE CURRENT RIVER, YOU WOULD KNOW BEST. I KNOW THAT THAT FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY IN EFFECT, OF COURSE, THOSE EVACUATIONS ORDERED THROUGH PARTS OF RIVER KERN LOW LYING AREAS OF CONCERN. VILLE IS SOME OF THIS THAT RAPID SNOW MELT THAT WE'RE SEEING. YEAH 100% IT IS. WE HAVE A RECORD SNOWPACK HERE IN THE SOUTHERN SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS WHERE THE CURRENT RIVER DRAINAGES AND WHAT? THAT WE GOT THIS WARM, ATMOSPHERIC RIVER SYSTEM THAT MOVED IN AND DUMPED WARM WEATHER WARM RAIN AND HAD THIS RAPID MELT OF SNOW AROUND THE 7 8000 FT. SO EVERYTHING BELOW 7 8000 FT IS STARTING TO MELT AND COME DOWN INTO DRAINAGE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING BEHIND US. IS THE CURRENT RIVER STARTING TO SWELL UP. AND LET ME ASK YOU TO BECAUSE IT DOES LOOK LIKE DEPENDING ON THE VIDEO. SO I DO SEE HOMES THAT NOW LOOK LIKE THE WATER IS VERY ON THEIR FRONT PORCH IN SOME CASES, SO AT THIS POINT, WE KNOW HOW MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THAT FLOODING AND MADE THIS POINT NO LONGER BE INHABITABLE BECAUSE OF JUST THE FLOODS, TAKING OVER. UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS. I CAN GET THAT LATER ON, OR THAT'S WHAT CURRENT COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT BUT AT THE MOMENT SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING YOU'RE SEEING THE VIDEO OR CAMPGROUNDS. CURRENT RIVER HAS PLENTY OF CAMPGROUNDS UP HERE, AND SOME OF THEM ARE SEASONAL. SO A LOT OF THESE TRAILERS ARE LEFT BEHIND BY RESIDENTS WHO JUST LEAVE. THEY PAY MONTHLY FOR ME. JUST SAVE YOUR SPOT. BUT THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T WANT TO EVACUATE. THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO GET THIS BAD AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE SEEING THEIR TRAILERS WOULD BE SUBMERGED. HMM WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW IF YOU KNOW, FLOOD INSURANCE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE AN OPTION TO PULL OUT IF IT'S EVER BEEN NEEDED. I MEAN, GARY, YOUR PERSPECTIVE. HAVE YOU SEEN THE CURRENT RIVER LIKE THIS BEFORE? I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A YEARS LONG DROUGHT, SPECIFICALLY THE PAST THREE YEARS HAVE JUST BEEN EXCRUCIATING, EXCEPTIONALLY DRY FOR CALIFORNIA IN YOUR EXPERIENCES CAN CAN THE CURRENT RIVER GET THIS BIG? IT DEFINITELY COULD IN 2017. THE RIVER WAS ABOUT HALF OF THIS. IT WAS ABOUT 25 26,000 CFS, AND IT WAS THE SAME THING . 2017 WAS A HUGE SNOWPACK YEAR AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE GOT A MASSIVE WARM, ATMOSPHERIC RIVER THAT JUST DO IT CREATED HUGE MELT SYSTEM AND SWELL THE RIVER AGAIN . WE HAD ANOTHER ONE BACK IN JANUARY AGAIN. IT WAS A SMALLER RUN OFF. THAT WAS ONLY ABOUT 17 CFS. BUT BACK IN 1966, THIS RIVER RAN AT ABOUT 100,000 CF FAST, WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST FLOWS WE'VE EVER SEEN DOWN HERE. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE BASICALLY TRIPLE. WHAT WHAT? WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH, NONETHELESS SCARY. THIS VIDEO IS INCREDIBLE. JUST TO SEE HOPE EVERYONE WAS WAS SAFE AND GOOD PERSPECTIVE THERE, KNOWING THE MOBILE HOMES WERE MAYBE FOR SOME PEOPLE'S JUSTIFICATION HOME TO GO AND HANG OUT AND TRY TO ENJOY JUST NOTHING FUN ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS THIS AFTERNOON THIS EVENING AND MORE. ON THE WAY AS WE HEAD INTO SUNDAY, GARY AND NANNY IN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CURRENT RIVER CONSERVANCY, THANK YOU"

Officers make the decisions and really make a lot of the coordinations and planning. And that comes down to us, and we make whatever they decide go. It’s our job to take charge, to make sure our personnel are being handled property and all their needs are being met, and ensuring our mission is being accomplished. My name is Lieutenant Commander Daniel Morales, and I am an officer in the United States Navy. My name is Petty Officer First Class Steven DesRoches, and I’m an enlisted sailor in the United States Navy. The requirements that a candidate must
meet before becoming an officer in the United States Navy is that they must
have a four year degree from an accredited university meet the physical
requirements and meet all the legal requirements. For the enlisted, you must meet the physical requirements, the legal requirements and be at least 17 years old with a high school diploma or equivalent. Candidates could start developing their leadership and management skills. They are going to be required to work under pressure and they're going to need to be able to
start learning the Navy's core values which are honor courage and commitment. Exactly. Time management is a very big skill and you can definitely learn that in college and on the job in the Navy. You definitely are challenged many times to be able to perform to your optimum under a variety of conditions and you will learn that extremely well in the Navy. You will learn how to be a manager, but more
importantly you learn how to multitask. As Petty Officer DesRoches can attest, being
in the Navy is a very dynamic and you have to be
able to multitask. Have the discipline to do that is going to be an extreme asset to you when you go for any job really. Becoming a leader is knowing your people and definitely knowing how to work different types of people work with different types of people to and over again. I think that the Navy will teach you not only the basics of
time management and knowing yourself but the leadership principles of knowing
your people. It's a based on mutual respect between the officer and enlisted. As far as
you and your day to day function. The officer is there and they're setting the example and setting forth what needs to happen. The enlisted is supposed to follow. Being able to carry out the work but be comfortable for me to be able to
approach him with an issue, or he should be able to be comfortable
enough certainly to come to me with an issue what needs to happen. Right. And furthermore, it's the officer will
take on their role at times as to provide that guidance and
leadership and even mentorship. It unlimited possibility whether you're coming in as an officer
or an enlisted. Being in the Navy is a way of life. It’s really just not
a job. It’s a call of duty. It's a something that someone could
really learn and develop within foster characteristics that you really can't
get anywhere else in the civilian sector. Definitely. Coming into the Navy not only gives you that technical expertise of a job that for me, I love my job. It's given me technical expertise to be able to do
that and a couple different fields. But it's also give me camaraderie, the sense of self, character, discipline and more opportunities, like Lt. Commander Morales was saying, you know, that I can handle College, advancement, benefits. I mean, I’m just overwhelmed. thank you for watching this Navy webcast.

In fact, we're mountains, or we're expecting 2 to 5 ft of snow to fall and when peak wind gusts of 55 to 75 MPH or up to double the threshold we just shared with you, so we have high confidence in blizzard conditions. For the area during the warning period, so Where are we looking at in terms of snowfall because we know there's some areas that haven't seen snow since 1989 that are going to be seeing snow. What are some of those areas? Sure so we're expecting so levels to drop as low as around 1500 ft, So that brings elevated valleys and play foothill communities of the Santa Monica Mountains. Other coastal mountain ranges. Uh so yeah, Some of these areas like you're mentioning. It's been 20. Plus years since I've seen some Well, you know, you tell us about the word blizzard, something that Alex pointed out that we never deal with Here were Avalanche. So you say that there is a high chance of expect that or potentially live ? Look at big bear right now is what we're looking at, Okay? Yes So, Yeah, we expect extreme avalanche threat, especially during the storm and within 24 hours after the storm is typically always see the highest threat for avalanches and anywhere above about four or 5000 ft, where we're expecting that to five ft. We could see even locally up to eight ft of snowfall, which is really incredible for Southern California. Wow So I remember that storm back in 1989. I was pretty young but living out in Agoura Hills, and we got snow, then I think it was the only time that we've added since. And so That's the kind of community right where we could be seeing snow in a couple of days. Yeah absolutely. We could see snow down to that level. We're feeling a little more confident up towards like Santa Clarita in that area, but can't rule out into even some of those value areas, But it's not going to be this unlikely to be the same in that storm in terms of some of the snowfall totals that lower the lowest elevations like we saw with the 89 storm. Wow Very dangerous and critical system. Alright well, we hope people are paying attention. They need to, uh, we appreciate you so much. Doctor Robbie Monroe, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Thank you and"
“No country can prosper if its basic industry is terrorism...” EAM Jaishankar’s dig at Pakistan,"External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar on February 23 attended the Inaugural Session of the Asia Economic Dialogue 2023 in Pune, Maharashtra. During the media interaction, EAM Jaishankar said that India-Pak’s relationship’s fundamental issue is of terrorism and that no country will ever come out of a difficult situation and become a prosperous power if its basic industry is terrorism. During the media interaction at the inaugural session of the Asia Economic Dialogue 2023 in Pune today, he said, “The reality of this relationship is that it has a fundamental issue that we cannot and must not avoid is of terrorism. A country has to fix its economic issue, a country has to fix its political issue and social issue too. No country is ever going to come out of a difficult situation and become a prosperous power if its basic industry is terrorism.” He also said, “But, it’s an equal fact that any county that gets into a serious economic problem that country has to make policy, choices, and governance decisions to get themselves out of it. Another neighbour, non- neighbour or another institution, others cannot solve a problem if you are not prepared to solve it yourself. Any country in deep economic difficulties has to come out of it through what the world can do is to provide options and support systems. The country must fix its social and political issues. If I plan any scheme or decision for a country, I must also consider the people’s perspective. What they want, they (Pakistan) must think about this. If any country faces a deep economic crisis, not only Pakistan but other countries too. They must fix their plans and decisions in the favour of people.”

Ohio Train Derailment: Residents Are Frustrated Over Chemical Spill Response | WSJ,"Some East Palestine residents have returned home after being ordered to leave after a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed there earlier this month.

#Ohio #TrainDerailment #WSJ",2023-02-17T21:36:42Z,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ,News & Politics,210,114480,1677,0,627,2023-11-07T10:49:47.285231,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NKWMdsn8XBo/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,NKWMdsn8XBo,"- [Kris Maher] I've been in
East Palestine this week, talking to residents who
were forced to evacuate after a derailment of a
Norfolk Southern train on February 3rd. Residents were told that
they could return home. But since they've been back, many have concerns about
being back in their homes, and they're concerned about smells and the potential for health effects from chemicals that were
released during the derailment. Right now, there's sort of, just this kind of cloud of concern that's hanging over the town.
(wind chimes ring) (soft staccato music) On Friday, February 3rd, around 9 p.m., a Norfolk Southern train derailed in the small village of
East Palestine, Ohio, which is on the border with Pennsylvania. As soon as the derailment occurred, police and other officials
came through the town and told people that they
had to evacuate immediately. (sirens blaring) Monday, February 6th, Norfolk Southern said that it would have
to breach five tanker cars containing vinyl chloride, to prevent a potentially
catastrophic explosion. - I honestly feel that the Palestine, the police department,
the fire department, all the first responders, they don't have the answers to give us because I don't think they know. They're not getting the
straight answers either. - [Kris] Residents in East
Palestine and surrounding areas packed the school gymnasium
Wednesday night to seek answers. - We're trying to get
information out to our citizens. Everybody's concerned, I'm concerned. But, you know, it's not
Norfolk Southern here. It's the EPA, the people who
have been working with us, trying to get our citizens
back into their homes safe. - We find it very hard to believe that there is no particulate map. - It was just a big runaround. Like, I feel like a lot of
the questions that were asked were people's rantings, and just speaking in circles. The answers that were given were things that we've already been told. - [Kris] Norfolk Southern
declined to send representatives to the town hall, citing safety concerns. The railroad said it has
distributed $1.5 million directly to more than 1,000 families,
and some businesses, and has established a $1 million fund available immediately to the community. One of the chemicals released
in the train derailment was vinyl chloride, which the National Cancer Institute says is associated with a higher
risk of liver cancer. Federal and state environmental regulators say they're going to continue
to monitor the air quality and water in the area, to ensure that it's safe for citizens. - What we have discovered through the testing and
sampling that's been done is that very early on, you know, we have estimated, based on our sampling and
modeling, about 3500 dead fish across that space, across those streams,
tributaries, waterways. - [Kris] The administrator for the US Environmental Protection Agency visited Thursday. - Let me be clear. EPA will exercise our oversight and our enforcement
authority under the law to be sure we are getting the results that the community deserves. - [Kris] So far, the EPA has said that air monitoring has
showed no levels of concern from chemicals released into the air. The EPA has also said that the water is safe to
drink in East Palestine from the municipal water facility. - This is so much bigger
than just it in the water. Our environment, our wildlife animals, our farmers that have
to till their soil up. - [Kris] Many residents want
testing inside their homes, which is being done. But even when it is being done, they're still kind of distrustful about those results at this point. (soft staccato music)"

The Portland, Vancouver area is digging out after heavy snowfall created chaos on the roads. Dozens of cars are still littered along the side of the freeway. They were abandoned by drivers after being stuck in traffic for hours across the entire region. Rd. crews worked to get highways moving again, but in many places there were still long delays. This stretch of Interstate 5 between Vancouver and Portland was at a standstill all morning. The road conditions are treacherous. You gotta be careful. One of the biggest trouble spots was the I5 ramp to I-84 E near the Lloyd District. A pair of semis were wedged together on this narrow, icy ramp. Traffic didn't move all night. So you've been here since? And here's since 12:30. In the morning, yes, truckers admit the treacherous conditions caught them off guard. What's ultimately the issue here? Nobody was prepared for and backups were compounded by drivers who abandoned their cars. And that is not one thing. Is all others in there with it? One right after the next, the perfect storm, as they say. Yeah, perfect storm. But for many, the biggest issue was ODOT. They argue the state agency responsible for Oregon highways was slow to respond. You know, in different states, they're they're a little bit more coordinated. On Wednesday night, in the thick of the storm, most Portland area freeways came to a standstill. KGW's Catherine Cook was stuck in traffic along I-5 for more than 7 hours. My photographer and I could definitely use a bathroom break, maybe a good stretch, and some food. With traffic snarled and no snow plow, Sanders or gravel trucks insight many drivers complained ODOT was to blame. If there was anybody on I 58425 that had any kind of life threatening emergency, they probably would have died. There was no getting through that traffic at all. What do you say to those folks? Could O dot have done better? We were hoping to do better than we did on that. We are down in staff right now. We can't get the roads cleared as quickly as we hope to because we're not at full staff, ODOT spokesperson Don Hamilton explained. The storm moved fast and crews. Couldn't clear freeways. They were already clogged with stalled cars and semis. Mother Nature hits us hard sometimes and we go with the tools as best we can and sometimes from other nature wins, and in this case, Mother Nature won. Hamilton says crews worked overnight to clear the roads, but with this much snow and ice in freezing temperatures, it will take time to get freeways back up to speed. Back here live on I-405, you can see the freeway actually looks pretty good here now it really is hit and miss around town. There are other spots that are very slick at this point. The Sun certainly has helped to clear some of this snow and ice away. Also worth mentioning, ODOT brought in crews and equipment from Central Oregon to help with the issues here in the Portland metropolitan area."

Who is Mark Wiens? Watch Complete History | A Quick Overview of Life and How I Started Traveling,"Please watch: ""Mark Wiens First Ever Food Review Show | Cambodia 2010 | Eating Bugs and Exploring Local Markets "" 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDB_wtr2F5w --~--
Hey, it's Mark Wiens from Migrationology.com. If you're interested in more, I will be sending you current travel and food updates, just sign up here: https://migrationology.com/migrationo...

While most of the time you probably see me eating food, I've been receiving a lot of questions lately asking me who exactly I am, how I started traveling, why I love eating so much, and how I earn a living. So in this video I'm going to quickly explain how and where I grew up.

I was born in Phoenix, Arizona, in the USA in 1986. My mother is from Hawaii, and she's Chinese, so I'm half Chinese. Visiting Hawaii, where food is a huge part of the culture, is where I first became so obsessed with all things food. My grandfather was a Chinese chef, so food has been a big part of my family.

My parents are Christian missionaries, so when I was 5 years old, we moved to France for a year. I attended my first year of school in France. We then moved to DR Congo, which was then known as Zaire. We lived in the middle of the jungle and as a kid I would run around exploring and eating interesting and rather bizarre jungle creatures. Due to war in Zaire, we moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where I attended a Christian international school for 8 years until graduating from high school. After high school I went back to Arizona and attended Arizona State University for 4 years, graduating with a degree in global studies.

After graduating, I didn't want to just get a job, so I started traveling again. I traveled in South America and then went to Asia where I finally got a job teaching English for a year. During that year though, I decided not to ever teach again but to do everything I could to make it as a freelancer on the internet and be able to have freedom to travel (and eat). It was in Thailand that I met my girlfriend, who is now my wife, so I am married!

This brings us up to now. For a living I do a combination of selling my own ebooks, freelance writing, making videos, and all sorts of other random projects like SEO and social media marketing.

Thank you very much for watching this life sketch video and if you have any questions for me, be sure to let me know in the comments below. You can also ask me on Facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",2019-01-08T16:19:33Z,UCLsw0HR0js3B1UdDP7Q4q8Q,People & Blogs,250,170074,6799,0,698,2023-11-07T10:49:50.355149,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YJOunCdzzCo/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)",YJOunCdzzCo,okay it's mark Wiens here lately I've been getting a lot of comments and questions about Who I am how I started traveling and how I started eating so I just wanted to share a little bit about that in this upcoming video okay so I was born in 1986 in Phoenix Arizona my mom she's actually Chinese but American born in Hawaii so I'm actually half Chinese and that's sort of the reason why I think I love Asian food so much my grandfather was actually a Chinese chef so I definitely have some roots with food okay so my parents are Christian missionaries so when I was five years old we moved to France and believe it or not that's where I attended my first year of school unfortunately I don't speak any more French really anymore but I wish I did then after France we moved to Democratic Republic of Congo and back then it was known as that year I think we lived there for about three and a half years or so and I was home-schooled but it was in Congo that I did a lot of awesome things like run around in the jungle with no shirt on and eat all kinds of jungle creatures I used to go with a slingshot and shoot little birds and eat them and I'd also eat all sorts of other jungle creatures like flying termites grubs delicious things like that but then when war broke out we relocated to Nairobi Kenya and that's where I attended school for about eight years until graduating from high school I went back to the United States and I attended Arizona State University for four years until graduating with a degree in global studies but throughout university I worked full-time and also I started a small little business selling things on eBay and of course throughout my university years I continued to eat as much as I could but after I graduated from university since I had been working I had a little bit of savings and so I decided to head down to South America I was in South America for about six months until decided to go to Asia and I flew into Bangkok and then traveled around Southeast Asia for about six months but then I was starting to get low on money so I decided to go back Bangkok and I actually signed a contract to teach English for one year and so I did I did teach for a full years but I'd have to say that English teaching is not really for me it was definitely a good experience but definitely not something I'd like to do long term so the good thing is that during that year I was able to take blogging really seriously I did a lot of hard work and I knew that I wanted to create something so that I didn't have to teach English again so I started doing freelance work continuing to blog and do all sorts of online projects it's also in Thailand where I met my girlfriend who is Thai and she's actually now my wife and she's the one who takes all of my videos so I'm extremely thankful for her she does an awesome awesome job and then that basically brings us to where we are right now I'm based in Thailand but still travel around quite frequently I mostly travel to pursue my stomach trying to eat all sorts of awesome food food has been a passion of mine all my life pretty much I think since the day I was born so I just love to eat okay finally I just want to say a big thank you to you for watching my videos I couldn't make them if you didn't watch them so thank you very much and lastly if you have any other questions for me just go ahead and leave a comment below and I'll definitely get back to you also it would be awesome if you would leave a comment telling me your name where you're from what you like to eat where you want to travel to I want to hear from you also and get to know you better so hope you enjoyed this video thanks again for watching my videos and lots lots and lots and lots more food coming soon [Music]
Journalist reveals Russian tactics after visiting Ukraine front lines,"Lynsey Addario, a New York Times photojournalist, speaks with CNN's Erin Burnett after returning from the front lines in Ukraine. #CNN #news",2023-02-15T21:00:31Z,UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw,News & Politics,257,261269,3839,0,757,2023-11-07T10:49:53.490002,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q-akb-vjbTg/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",q-akb-vjbTg,"I want to go now to Lynsey Addario, Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times photojournalist. She just returned from a trip to the frontlines in Ukraine. And Lynsey, I know on this trip, you spent time nearby where the volcano troops, of course, have been leading the fight for Russia. And the fighting there is incredibly fierce this close quarters fighting that David was just talking about. What did you learn? Well, I was working for about three weeks. And Dan Boss, very close to Bermuda and as well near criminal where there are intensive battles going on continuously. I was working with Michael Schwartz for The New York Times. And what we were seeing was sort of an endless trail of fighters going to and from the frontline, a lot of wounded soldiers coming in, people talking about how Russia is basically sending an endless supply of soldiers to the front, to the fight and really sort of dispensable soldiers, soldiers that they clearly don't mind if they get killed in battle. And it's sort of wave after wave of Russian soldiers coming at them, some in ambushes and some just sort of constantly targeting them. And so definitely there's been an uptick in fighting. Their goal, obviously, is to exhaust the Ukrainian forces so that when they come in wave after wave, eventually they send in their most professional fighters at a point where the Ukrainian soldiers are exhausted already and running low on ammunition. And, you know, see, you're actually seeing that happening in real time here. I know you also, Lindsey, did some reporting on a Ukrainian army unit that's called the Free Russia Legion. And that unit's entirely made up of Russians fighting for Ukraine. And I know you and your team were doing that reporting you took a photo of the unit fighting on the front lines that I wanted to share. This is your picture of them. Again, these are the Russians fighting for Ukraine. Why are they doing that? Well, they're doing that first and foremost because morally, they believe this is wrong, that they believe that Russia should not have invaded Ukraine. And they feel that it's their way of standing up to what they feel is an unjust war. So so it's really a moral sort of stand. And then there are, of course, Russians who have lived in Ukraine for a long time, and they feel like they want to fight on behalf of the Ukrainians. And then there's just, of course, people who detest Putin and want to sort of free their country from his leadership. So there are various reasons. We spoke to Michael Schwartz as a reporter, and it was really the story was led by him, but we met sort of both on the frontline. The trip to the frontline was very quick because it was extremely dangerous. As you can imagine, the Russian Legion are the soldiers that the Russians really would like to target because they're their own countrymen fighting for the enemy. So we were about a mile from Russian positions. And so we did a trip there and we did a training. Wow. And I want to show another photo. This is a man named Zaza, a fighter with that Russia free Russia Legion. What stood out to you about him? I mean, it's just incredible, by the way, the context you're giving here that you're about a mile away from the Russians. And you know for whom these guys, this free Russian Legion unit would be target number one. So Zaza looked like a baby. I mean, he was incredibly young. We met him at a training so that was in the Kiev region. That was not at the front line. He was preparing to go to the frontline. They had been training for several months. And very well-trained, very professional. And Zaza talked about how he just didn't believe in his country fighting this war. And he made a decision finally to just walk across the border into Ukraine and offer himself up to fight to the Ukrainian military. There's a system whereby, of course, all of these Russian soldiers have background checks and have to be and are vetted before they can fight for the Russian Legion. Yeah, it is incredible, though, and incredible just to imagine what it would take at such a young point in your life to do that and to walk across that border you have. So incredible. Lindsey, thank you so much. I appreciate it as always. Thank you. Fantastic to speak to you and see your incredible work. Thank."

Russian missile storm turns Avdiivka into 'post-apocalyptic' city; Zelensky vows fightback,"Russia's mega-push in eastern Ukraine has left the city of Avdiivka in ruins. The Russian Army's missile hurricane has literally blown up the city. The shelling forced a nearly full shutdown of Avdiivka, which lies some 90 kilometres southwest of Bakhmut, where Russian troops claim to have control. A top Ukrainian military official, Vitaliy Barabash, said that the Russian onslaught is turning Avdiivka into 'a place from post-apocalyptic movies.' The Ukrainian military claims that Russia could make Avdiivka a 'second Bakhmut,' where fierce fighting described as a 'meat grinder' has turned the city into rubble.

The South China Sea dispute explained,"Subscribe to our YouTube channel for free here: 
https://sc.mp/subscribe-youtube

China and several of its neighbours have been involved in a decades-long dispute over who controls the South China Sea. China claims most of the sea as its territory, but the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan say parts of the sea belong to them. Tensions have risen over the years and resulted in several confrontations as well as US involvement. The South China Morning Post looks at the origins of the dispute, what these countries are fighting over and what they’re doing to assert their territorial claims.

Russia-Ukraine Conflict
WSJ’s latest news coverage around the 2022-2023 Russia-Ukraine conflict.

#Ukraine #Russia #WSJ",2023-02-14T16:30:29Z,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ,News & Politics,244,477938,5442,0,1034,2023-11-07T10:50:06.669606,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I-h8npgBZXY/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",I-h8npgBZXY,"- [Narrator] This is the F-16 fighter jet, developed by the US with a
number of European partners. And this is the Su-35, the
Russian equivalent being deployed in the Ukraine War. Kyiv says it wants 200 western jets, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon,
F-16, or Swedish Gripen, so they can dominate the skies. - We have freedom, give
us wings to protect it. - [Narrator] And while the US has said it won't give fighter jets to Kyiv, the UK and some European
countries are now considering sending combat aircraft. - Any decision to send or
to supply combat aircraft would inevitably be significant. - [Narrator] So what
capabilities could western jets give Ukraine? And how do they compare to
the main Russian jet deployed in the war? (jet engine roaring) First, let's look at why western
jets are important to Kyiv. So far, neither Ukraine nor Russia has achieved air superiority. That's an air force's ability
to take control of the sky, stopping anybody other than themselves from entering a particular airspace. At the start of the war, Moscow had nearly 1,200
combat-capable aircraft, according to the IISS Think Tank. That was far more than Kyiv's inventory of around 120 aging Soviet-era aircraft. - So the challenge for Ukraine
is its combat air inventory is increasingly difficult to maintain. In a combat environment, you really need as many of your aircraft
available and on the flight line as you can have, almost round the clock. - [Narrator] To avoid
using their limited jets, Ukraine has focused on its air defenses, shooting down over a hundred
Russian planes and helicopters with surface-to-air missiles. This has made Moscow
reluctant to send its own jets beyond the frontline. Analysts say it's mainly used
the long-range capabilities of its air force to strike
Ukrainian targets from afar. - So one of the challenges
the Ukrainians have is that their Soviet-era air-to-air missiles, particularly the
beyond-visual-range weapons don't have anything like
the engagement range that the Russian combat
aircraft do at the moment. - [Narrator] Experts say
western jets would allow Kyiv to counter Russia's air force directly, changing the balance
of power in the skies. So, let's look at the specifics of how these jets operate
on the battlefield. Russia's Su-35 is larger
than the aircraft Ukraine could receive from its allies, allowing it to carry a
bigger weapon's payload. It's also equipped with a passive sensor that can spot opposing jets
without being detected itself. Paired with long-range missiles
that can fire at targets over 60 miles away, analysts say it's had a
distinct advantage in medium and long-range aerial encounters against Ukraine's current
inventory of Soviet-era aircraft. But western jets, such as
the F-16, would come equipped with advanced medium-range missiles, including the American AIM-120. Analysts say these weapons
could level the playing field, allowing Ukraine to more
effectively challenge Russia's air force in medium
and long-range encounters. But when it comes to air power, it's not just the systems that matter. The person piloting the
jet is just as important. Experts say Ukraine's pilots
will need extensive training for up to a year to use any
western aircraft effectively. - You can't just take somebody out of a Soviet-design combat
aircraft and expect them to be able to fight to the
same level the next day. Even for an experienced fast-jet pilot, there is a period of
conversion and just to get used to the aircraft, its
displays, how it handles, and then you also gotta learn
how to fight the aircraft. - [Narrator] So the UK has agreed to start training Ukrainian pilots, as Kyiv continues to press its
allies into providing jets. Western governments are nervous
that providing the weapons, which could be used to
hit targets inside Russia, could escalate the war. (missile firing) But analysts say that any model of jet would complement the arsenal of weaponry, including HIMARS and tanks, that Kyiv is already
receiving from its allies. (tense music)"

India explains why it abstained from UN vote on Ukraine,"India at the United Nation General Assembly called for global peace and security on February 24. As the day marks a year of the Russia-Ukraine disastrous war, Permanent Representative of India to the UN, Ruchira Kamboj stated why India abstained from the UN vote to Ukraine and also pointed out its help to earthquake-hit Turkey. She said, “We are providing humanitarian support to Ukraine and some of its neighbours in the global south under economic distress even as they stare at the accelerating costs of food, fuel and fertilizers which has been a consequential fall out of the ongoing conflict”

Russia-Ukraine Conflict
WSJ’s latest news coverage around the 2022-2023 Russia-Ukraine conflict.

#Ukraine #Tanks #WSJ",2023-03-01T15:31:34Z,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ,News & Politics,291,469147,6135,0,1090,2023-11-07T10:50:12.773395,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cu3N0y7Sf8/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",5cu3N0y7Sf8,"(pensive music) - [Narrator] This Ukrainian crew is driving a British Challenger 2 tank. Kyiv's forces are training to maneuver, (gun loading) load ammunition and maintain
Western military vehicles ahead of their delivery to the battlefield, which the UK says could be weeks away. So far in the war, both Ukraine and Russia have been
using Soviet era tanks, such as the T-72, but the UK
is one of several NATO members including Germany and
the US that have offered to send Western style tanks to Kyiv. The Wall Street Journal
visited the Ukrainian troops learning to operate
the systems to find out the key technical differences
with Russian tanks. - [Trainer] Reverse. Keep the grips in. (tank rumbling) - [Narrator] The British Army is taking the Ukrainian soldiers through different stages of training. They're currently three
weeks into the program. First, let's look at maneuvering. Some drills are being
taught on training tanks, which don't have turrets. - We are at the point
of the advanced sections and that's more how to use the tank in a tactical environment,
how fast you can move it, how much it can take essentially before you have to basically
rein it in a little bit. - [[Narrator] Gregor
is a Ukrainian Soldier learning these skills. (Gregor speaking in foreign language) (tank rumbling) - [Narrator] The Challenger
2 tanks are slower than the Soviet era T-72
vehicles, as they're heavier. - Soviet era tanks are smaller and lighter than Western tanks so they'll find it easier
to get up a steep hill because they weigh 45 or 50 tons as opposed to about 70
tons of a Challenger. - [Trainer] So when
you've got steep hills, because the gun might dig into the floor when you come down the hill, sometimes you'll need
to stop and put the gun over the side just to get down the hill. - [Narrator] Then there's
the differences in firepower. The Challenger 2 has a 120 millimeter rifled barrel tank gun. That means the inside of
the turret has grooves while the T-72 uses what's
known as a smooth bore armament which means it has a flat interior. - In theory, rifling makes
the gun more accurate but it also slightly slows down the round. The T-72 has an auto loader so there's a sort of circular cassette of ammunition in the base of the turret. - [Narrator] That's in contrast to the Challenger 2, which
requires manual loading. - There are four people who
operate a Challenger 2 tank. We have a loader operator,
which is different from the the tanks that
they have at the moment because they have an auto
loader in their tanks and we have a person to do that. - [Narrator] The British Army
is training Ukrainian forces to load the ammunition
using a simulator machine called a loaders drill trainer or LDT. This helps the crew practice
loading up the tank, ready to fire. (gun shooting)
- [Announcer] target. Target stopped. - The loader needs to
know how to get the big, heavy 120 millimeter shell
into the breach of the gun. Now, that just needs practice. It's not a complicated task but physically, it's quite challenging and it's even more challenging
when the vehicle's in combat and moving around. - [Narrator] Ukrainian
forces are also learning to maintain the vehicle
so they can run smoothly. - We started off with
the maintenance phase and the technical details
phase, to install components how they work, every single
aspect of the tank essentially. - [Narrator] Lessons include how to check these rubber triangles
situated on the wheels. They need regular checks during combat. - Tracked vehicles do
break down more frequently than a wheeled vehicle of similar size. (pensive music) - [Narrator] Overall, military
analysts say the readiness of the Ukrainian forces will depend on how quickly they can learn. - Some of the Ukrainian armed forces have operated tanks before but most of them have not seen a tank. - [Narrator] But getting to
grips with battlefield tactics and the electronic systems
on board could be difficult for those without prior experience according to defense analysts. The number of Western vehicles provided could also be a hurdle for Ukraine. Kyiv requested 300 western tanks but defense experts say only around 50 to 60 have been offered so far. Russian officials attacked
the pledges for tanks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov said Moscow sees them as increasing the West's direct
involvement in the conflict. (soldiers shouting) For the Ukrainian soldiers
training here in the UK, the lessons could soon
be put into practice. (pensive music)"

Ukraine could threaten ‘vulnerable’ Crimea within months in ‘biggest blow’ to Putin,"“The Russians will have think about how far they’re going to push this war because if it would cost them Crimea, then clearly the war would be massively counter-productive.”

Ukraine could be in a position to “threaten” Crimea within the next few months in what would be the “biggest blow” to Putin, Professor Michael Clarke tells #TimesRadio.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",HYOOpGIikAI,Crimea matters terribly to President Putin I mean this was the territory that he seized back illegally in 2014 and he offers Crimea as his great victory in terms of recreating the empire of Catherine the Great and Peter the Great if he were to lose it undoubtedly there would be a pretty big reaction in the Kremlin because Ukraine's Navy Chief has told the times that he is now thinking about how his Navy can attack Crimea Crimea was taken by Russia back in 2014 it captured much of the Ukrainian Navy and has since seemed near impregnable since then could it ever be retaken joining us this morning is the former director general of rusi Professor of Defense studies and security analyst Michael Clark morning Michael yes good morning how doable is this then because we're so used to to where we think that that there is a fighting iron in Ukraine particularly in the East Crimea has always felt like a a pretty hard target for Ukrainian to take is it on the table is it is it accessible now do you feel uh it's accessible but it's not the same as taking it um it would be a very hard nut to crack militarily not impossible but not in the short term but what the Navy Chief was really saying which was the truth is that they've built up enough forces not not a formal Navy they've never had much of a Navy they didn't have time to build it up before the invasion started but they've built up Coastal defenses and they've got a lot more missiles and they've got these robotic boats now these automatic drone boats which have penetrated Sebastopol Harbor on at least two maybe three occasions even and of course they sank the mosfer with missiles so the Ukrainian Navy is able Now to control most of what happens in the western part of the Black Sea rather than leave it to the Russians and they could threaten um Crimea and that's the point the ukrainians in the next few months if they're successful in their um their offensive which will begin we think you know in the next month they may be in a position both by land and sea to throw threaten Crimea to threaten the Russian naval base of Sebastopol which is very very important to the Russians both emotionally and logistically and also Russian forces in Crimea so you know making crime invulnerable is entirely plausible but they're moving in and taking it would be a different proposition for some time later in the war I would guess and by making it vulnerable presumably does that mean that the Russia sends some of its forces down to Crimea which might make the assault in the East more likely to succeed for Ukraine yes I mean they would have to there's only two routes out of Crimea so by Road and rails sort of a Northeastern and Northwest strip if you look at a map Crimea is only very tenuously connected to the mainland of Ukraine and so those routes you know are both you know good and bad for Defenders and attackers because they're so narrow and it's entirely plausible that the Russians would then feel that they need to reinforce Ukraine in case the yeah yeah reinforced Crimea in case the ukrainians decided to try to make a an assault on on the peninsula itself so it would open up a new front in the war um an active front for Russia which would be beneficial to Ukraine because it would be something else for the Russians to have to worry about and don't underestimate I mean this that would be escalatory in war terms because Crimea matters terribly to President Putin I mean this was the territory that he seized back illegally in 2014 and he offers Crimea as his great uh victory in terms of recreating the Empire of Catherine the Great and Peter the Great if you were to lose it undoubtedly there would be a pretty big reaction in the Kremlin yeah and that's interesting to know what that reaction would be because you could make the case could you not Michael that losing Crimea would be curtains for Putin because it's it's so linked to his Prestige and The Prestige of the nation yeah I think that's entirely plausible it would depend on what else is going on in Moscow but it would be the biggest blow that Putin had ever taken in his career which goes back to 1999 and um it would be pretty consequential but as I say the um the immediate objective can achieve quite a lot of that by threatening Crimea because if the ukrainians can put Crimea in a sort of a in a vice so that they can pressure it at will which is exactly the way the Russians would do it if they if the boot was on the other foot if they could do that then the Russians will have to think about how far they're going to push this war because if it was a custom Crimea then clearly the war would be massively um counterproductive really interesting stuff we'll have to see what happens in this spring offensive Michael thank you for joining us that's Michael Clark the former director general of rusi Professor of Defense studies and security analyst and if you like that you can listen to us we're sticking asthma have you forgotten well done every Monday to Thursday on times radio breakfast

Is it possible to lose weight fast? - Hei Man Chan,"Is it possible to lose weight fast— in a healthy way? Dig into how different forms of dieting affect your body. 

--


In the wealthiest circles of Victorian England, dieters would swallow an unhatched tapeworm and let it grow inside them by consuming undigested meals. And while modern fad diets aren’t usually this extreme, they do promise similar results; specifically, losing weight fast. So, are there any fast diets that do work? And are any of them actually healthy for you? Hei Man Chan investigates.

of Victorian England, bizarre fads ran rampant. But perhaps none was as strange
as the tapeworm diet, in which dieters swallowed
an unhatched tapeworm and let it grow inside them 
by consuming undigested meals. Obviously, this is an exceptionally
dangerous and unhealthy way to manage your weight. However, while modern fad diets
aren't usually this extreme, they do promise similar results;
specifically, losing weight fast. So, are there any fast diets that do work? And are any of them 
actually healthy for you? To answer these questions, 
let’s consider a thought experiment. Sam and Felix are identical twins
both planning to go on a diet. They share the same height, weight,
fat and muscle mass. But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,
while Felix wants to go fast. Sam's plan is to gradually decrease
his calorie intake and increase his regular exercise. With less energy coming in
and more being expended, he’s creating an energy deficit
inside his body. To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking 
down his emergency glucose supply, stored in the liver 
in the form of glycogen. Then, after 4 to 6 hours, 
his body starts burning fat cells as a major energy source. This process releases lipid droplets which are broken down into compounds
that float through the bloodstream and provide energy to organs and tissues. Felix aims to create 
a similar energy deficit by dramatically cutting 
his calorie intake. Unlike Sam, 
who’s still eating smaller meals, Felix is eating almost nothing. And his body responds by going
into a starvation response. Felix’s body breaks down his entire store
of emergency glucose in just 18 hours. And while Sam steadily replenishes
glycogen with every healthy meal, Felix’s low-calorie diet does not. Desperate for energy, his body starts
breaking down other materials, including his muscles. Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise 
is maintaining his muscle mass. This means he’ll use more energy
both during exercise and at rest, making it easier for him to lose weight. Felix, on the other hand,
is losing muscle mass and burning fewer calories than ever
for his body's basic functions, making weight loss even more difficult. Despite all this, there’s one element
of Felix’s fast diet that might make him think
he's on the right track. Every gram of glycogen is bound
to several grams of water. This can add up to two kilograms
of water weight, all of which is lost 
when the glycogen is depleted. For Felix, this might seem like
he’s losing weight fast. But as soon as he stops starving himself, his body will replenish its glycogen store
and regain that weight. Clearly, Felix’s plan does
more harm than good, but extreme calorie reduction diets
aren’t the only regimens promising to shed weight fast. Plans called “detoxification diets” 
either promote or restrict certain foods to provide specific nutrients
in high quantities. These can be useful for addressing
some nutritional problems, but they’re far too specific 
to be used as general cure-alls. For example, for a person 
with low vitamin A, a juice diet might be helpful. But for someone high in vitamin A,
juicing could be disastrous. And regardless of personal nutrition, maintaining a juice diet 
over multiple weeks is likely to compromise the immune system due to a lack of essential fats
and proteins. Therein lies the problem 
with all these fast-moving diets— whether you’re cutting calories
or food groups, extreme diets are a shock to your system. There are well-established rates 
of healthy weight loss motivated by both diet and exercise that account for genetic and medical
differences. And staying on those timelines requires 
a dietary lifestyle that’s sustainable. In fact, some of the worst side effects
of extreme diets are rarely discussed since so few people
stick with them, it also bears mentioning that many
societies have unhealthy relationships with weight, and people are often pressured to diet for
reasons other than health or happiness. So rather than trying to lose weight fast, we should all be taking our time 
to figure out what the healthiest lifestyle
is for ourselves."

Here’s Why,"Slovakia President Zuzana Caputova has warned that public support in the NATO country for aiding war-torn Ukraine could suffer ahead of elections. Slovakia is an eastern flank NATO member that borders Ukraine and has been a staunch backer of Kyiv.

The Akune brothers: Siblings on opposite sides of war - Wendell Oshiro,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-akune-brothers-siblings-on-opposite-sides-of-war-wendell-oshiro

There are many stories that can be told about World War II, from the tragic to the inspiring. But perhaps one of the most heart-rending experiences was that of the Akune family, divided by the war against each other, and against their own identities. Wendell Oshiro tells the surprising story of this family split apart by war. 

Lesson by Wendell Oshiro, animation by Brandon Denmark.",2015-07-21T15:15:20Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,294,1923373,38356,0,1226,2023-11-07T10:50:18.769924,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/de56W-F93nw/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,de56W-F93nw,"There are many stories
that can be told about World War II, from the tragic to the inspring. But perhaps one 
of the most heartrending experiences was that of the Akune family, divided by the war against each other
and against their own identities. Ichiro Akune and his wife Yukiye immigrated to America
from Japan in 1918 in search of opportunity, opening a small grocery store
in central California and raising nine children. But when Mrs. Akune died in 1933, the children were sent to live
with relatives in Japan, their father following soon after. Though the move was a difficult adjustment after having been born 
and raised in America, the oldest son, Harry, formed a close bond
with his grand uncle, who taught him the Japanese language,
culture and values. Nevertheless, as soon as Harry
and his brother Ken were old enough to work, they returned to the country
they considered home, settling near Los Angeles. But then, December 7, 1941,
the attack on Pearl Harbor. Now at war with Japan, the United States government
did not trust the loyalty of those citizens who had family
or ancestral ties to the enemy country. In 1942, about 120,000 Japanese Americans
living on the West Coast were stripped of their civil rights and forcibly relocated 
to internment camps, even though most of them, 
like Harry and Ken, were Nisei, American or dual citizens 
who had been born in the US to Japanese immigrant parents. The brothers not only had very limited
contact with their family in Japan, but found themselves confined
to a camp in a remote part of Colorado. But their story took another twist when recruiters from the US Army's
military intelligence service arrived at the camp looking for
Japanese-speaking volunteers. Despite their treatment by the government, Harry and Ken jumped 
at the chance to leave the camp and prove their loyalty 
as American citizens. Having been schooled in Japan, they soon began their service, translating captured documents, interrogating Japanese soldiers, and producing Japanese 
language propaganda aimed at persuading 
enemy forces to surrender. The brothers' work was invaluable
to the war effort, providing vital strategic information about the size 
and location of Japanese forces. But they still faced discrimination
and mistrust from their fellow soldiers. Harry recalled an instance where his combat gear 
was mysteriously misplaced just prior to parachuting 
into enemy territory, with the white officer reluctant
to give him a weapon. Nevertheless, both brothers 
continued to serve loyally through the end of the war. But Harry and Ken were not the only Akune
brothers fighting in the Pacific. Unbeknownst to them, two younger brothers, the third and fourth 
of the five Akune boys, were serving dutifully 
in the Imperial Japanese Navy, Saburo in the Naval Airforce, and 15-year-old Shiro as
an orientation trainer for new recruits. When the war ended, Harry and Ken
served in the allied occupational forces and were seen as traitors by the locals. When all the Akune brothers
gathered at a family reunion in Kagoshima for 
the first time in a decade, it was revealed that the two pairs
had fought on opposing sides. Tempers flared 
and a fight almost broke out until their father stepped in. The brothers managed to make peace and Saburo and Shiro joined
Harry and Ken in California, and later fought for the US Army in Korea. It took until 1988 for the US government to acknowledge the injustice 
of its internment camps and approve reparations payments
to survivors. For Harry, though, his greatest regret
was not having the courage to thank his Japanese grand uncle
who had taught him so much. The story of the Akune brothers 
is many things: a family divided by circumstance, the unjust treatment 
of Japanese Americans, and the personal struggle of reconciling
two national identities. But it also reveals a larger story
about American history: the oppression faced by immigrant groups
and their perseverance in overcoming it."

STUNNING NEW VIDEO IS RAISING  QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONDITION  OF RAILCARS INVOLVED IN THE  FIERY TRAIN DERAILMENT THAT  HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN OHIO.  >> PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO LEAVE  THEIR HOMES AFTER THE TRAIN  DERAILED IN EAST PALESTINE.  EARLIER THIS MONTH, HAZARDOUS  CHEMICALS WERE RELEASED IN THE  VIDEO ON YOUR SCREEN SHOWS THAT  THE TRAIN APPEARED TO BE ON  FIRE.  20 MILES BEFORE IT REACHED THE  SITE WHERE IT WENT OFF THE  TRACKS.  DERAILED.  THE FOOTAGE ON YOUR SCREEN WAS  CAPTURED BY SECURITY CAMERAS  ADD AN EQUIPMENT PLANT IN  SALEM, OHIO.  >> WITH BRINGING A REPORTER FOR  OUR PITTSBURGH AFFILIATE.  ERIKA, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US  ABOUT WHAT THIS VIDEO IS ALL  ABOUT AND WHAT IT SHOWS IN ONE  YEAR QUESTIONS IT RAISES?  >> SO, THE VIDEO YOU'RE SEEING  IS FROM AN INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT  FACILITY. YOU ARE SEEING THOSE  SPARKS ON A PORTION OF THE  TRAIN AND AS YOU MENTIONED,  WHERE THIS VIDEO WAS SHOT IS  ABOUT 20 MILES FROM EAST  PALESTINE WHERE THAT THE ROMAN  HAPPEN.  THE CAMERA, WHEN THE TRAIN IS  PASSING IT IN THE FOOTAGE WITH  CAPTURE, THIS WAS AROUND 8:12  THAT EVENING.  THE DERAILMENT HAPPENED 20  MILES LATER AT AROUND 8: 55.  THIS BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF,  OKAY,  WHERE WAS THE CREW ON  BOARD MADE AWARE THAT THERE WAS  AN ISSUE?  THIS BRINGS UP THE ISSUE OF THE  DETECTORS WHICH ARE ALONGSIDE  THE TRACKS.  THE DETECTORS ARE IN PLACE SO  THE CREW ON BOARD KNOWS IF  THERE IS SOMETHING  MALFUNCTIONING OR IF THERE IS  SOMETHING THEY NEED TO BE AWARE  OF BECAUSE IF THEY ARE AWARE OF  THAT, IS TO HELP THEM AVOID  SITUATIONS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE.  NOW, I SPOKE TO A RETIRED  RAILROAD ENGINEER AND HE WAS  SAYING THAT THESE DETECTORS ARE  PLACED ABOUT EVERY 20 MILES.  WE ARE RIGHT IN THAT ZONE WHERE  WE'RE QUESTIONING, OKAY, WHERE  WAS THE DETECTOR?  WHEN WAS THE CREW ALERTED TO AN  ISSUE?  WE NOTE THAT THE CREW DID GET  AN ALERT.  ANY TIME THERE IS AN ISSUE ON  THE TRACKS, THE CREW IS ALERTED  AND THOSE DETECTORS ALERT THE  CREW ON BOARD AND WHEN THERE IS  AN ALERT, THEY DO NEED TO STOP  THE TRAIN IN SOME CASES,  IMMEDIATELY.  WHAT THIS RETIRED ENGINEER WAS  SAYING IS THAT BASICALLY, THEY  WERE LOOKING IN THIS VIDEO AT  WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A HOT  WHEEL.  THESE DETECTORS CAN DETECT IF  THERE IS SOME SORT OF  DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE.  RIGHT.  HE BELIEVES THAT IF THE  DETECTOR WAS IN THE AREA WHERE  WE ARE SEEING THAT HOT WHEEL,  THE CREW SHOULD HAVE BEEN  NOTIFIED RIGHT AWAY.  THE QUESTION IS, IF IT WAS HOT  ENOUGH AT THE TIME WHEN HE WENT  OVER THE DETECTOR TO NOTIFY  THEM IN TIME, OR IF THEY  ALREADY GONE OVER THAT  DETECTOR, IN SALEM AREA, BEFORE  THAT WILL STARTED TO SPARK AND  GET HOT, LIKE I SAID, WE KNOW  THERE WAS ANOTHER PASSED ON TO  THE CREW.  AGAIN, IT COMES DOWN TO THE  QUESTION OF WHERE THAT DETECTOR  WAS AND HOW QUICKLY THEY WERE  ABLE TO GET THAT MESSAGE AND  ULTIMATELY STOP THE TRAIN.  THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS COMING  UP NOW AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING  THE NTSB IS LOOKING INTO.  THEY TALKED WITH THE CREW  MEMBERS ON BOARD TO SEE WHAT  ALERTS THEY GOT, WHEN THEY GOT  THEM AND WILL ALSO REVIEW AND  REFACING CAMERAS ON THE TRAIN  AND AUDIO RECORDERS TO  DETERMINE IF THEIR ACTIONS  MATCH UP WITH WHAT THEY WERE  SUPPOSED TO BE DOING ON THAT  TRAIN WHEN THEY GET THE ALERTS.  >> THANK YOU SO MUC"

"UK to consider sending more tanks to Ukraine, says defence secretary - BBC News","The UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he will consider sending more British tanks to Ukraine if they are used effectively. 

Mr Wallace was speaking after meeting Ukrainian troops training on the British Army’s Challenger 2 tanks for the first time in the UK.

The UK was the first to pledge 14 modern main battle tanks to Ukraine with several more countries now promising to send more.

Ukraine said it needs western weapons to retake its territory from Russia.

Crew members often spend weeks or even months away from home and do not exactly lead a luxurious life while doing so. On an aircraft carrier, it is common knowledge that officers enjoy superior living conditions to those of the sailors. Why is there such a difference in the life of an officer and a sailor?

A member of the Navy who serves in the enlisted ranks is called a sailor, while officers are Members of the Navy or Navy Reserve who meet the minimum educational criteria of possessing a degree from a college or university that offers a four-year program and who have completed Officer Training are eligible to become commissioned officers.
Officers have separate berthing areas from enlisted personnel which is commonly referred to as “officer country.” Officers have their private quarters in which they sleep. Mess decks are where junior sailors, leading seaman, and below sailors sleep. Senior sailors, including Petty Officers and higher, sleep in multi-berth rooms that are arranged according to their ranks, such as PO, CPO, and MCPO.
The officers' quarters are all the same. Because it is situated over both a pull-out desk and a chest of drawers, the bunk bed is somewhat elevated. A compact cabinet and a foldable wash basin are located at the very end of the bed.

Goliath Vs David? China & Fisherfolks Of The Philippines And Vietnam,"In June 2020 , a Chinese Coast Guard patrol vessel rammed and looted a Vietnamese fishing boat in the Paracel Islands. Acts of aggression like these from China have hindered the livelihoods of fishermen in the South China Sea, who struggle to defend their rights to fish in one of the most contested regions in the world.

Armed Chinese ships escorting Chinese fishing fleets have been known to chase, use water cannons on, capture or even set fire to fishing vessels from the Philippines and Vietnam found in waters that Beijing lays claims to within its  “nine-dash-line” boundary. These include the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, the Macclesfield Bank and the Scarborough Shoal. 

The last falls within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines, and in 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruled that China’s claim of “historical rights” to the shoal had no legal basis, and that it had violated the Philippines’ “traditional fishing rights”.

But China has ignored the ruling and its fishing fleets have continued to muscle out Filipino fishermen, who are enraged that the Duterte administration isn’t taking a stance on this matter.

Ukrainian troops say 'formidable' Challenger 2s can change course of Ukraine war,"Ukrainian tank drivers have described how significant the British Challenger 2 tank will be in the war with Russia.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace visited Bovington Camp in Dorset and took a ride on a training vehicle being used to teach experienced Ukrainian personnel how to handle the Challenger 2 battle tank – as the UK prepares to send 14 to Ukraine.

One Ukrainian tank driver said the Challenger 2 is ""very formidable"" and has ""very good defence system"".

Another driver said it is ""exactly the type of weapon"" needed in Ukraine and that it can change the course of the war.

Below you will find our sun. Our star is 2
octillion tons of hot hydrogen gas emitting 400 septillion joules of energy every second.
The hottest part of the sun is its 15 million°C core, where it's been fusing hydrogen into
helium for the past 4.6 billions years. Despite that, it's only considered a middle aged star! Now let’s check out the closest planet to
our sun, Mercury. Orbiting the sun in just 88 days, Mercury also has the most elliptical
orbit of any planet. It spins very slowly, once every 2/3 of its orbital period. Despite its
surface reaching a blistering 430°C, it still has water ice in permanently shadowed craters near its
poles, where the temperatures stay below -170° C. The next planet in our solar system is Venus.
It’s the planet with the hottest surface temperature; at 460°C it’s hot enough to
melt lead. Its air is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide, with a thick layer of sulfuric
clouds. Its rotational axis is flipped upside-down, which means that the planet spins backwards. The third and best understood planet is Earth.
Our home planet has a dense metal core, a thick viscous rock mantle, and a thin crust.
It's unique in the solar system for having humans and permanent liquid water on its surface.
Other planets may get the former soon. At 3470 km in diameter, our Moon has the largest
moon-to-planet size ratio. It's thought to have formed when a small planet impacted Earth
at a grazing angle billions of years ago. It’s heavily cratered, and has huge flood
plains on it called maria. Next up in our system is Mars. Its iconic
red color comes from its rusty rocks and dust. In the past Mars was once very wet, with oceans,
a thick atmosphere, and a warmer climate. But its lack of a magnetic field meant no protection
from the solar wind, which eroded its atmosphere away. Between Mars and Jupiter is a large asteroid belt. It’s a ring shaped region containing rubble leftover
from the formation of the planets. Past the asteroid belt we find our systems
Jovian planets, starting with Jupiter. A gas giant, it’s the largest planet in our solar
system. It has a dynamic atmosphere, including belts, zones, and a gigantic red spot created
by a persistent hurricane. The Great Red Spot is a persistent anticyclonic storm. The spot
is large enough to contain three Earth-sized planets. It’s still unclear what exactly
gives the spot its red color. The next planet in our system is Saturn. It’s
a gas giant with a broad set of rings. It has a hexagonal cloud pattern on its north
pole. It's the least dense of all the planets, even less dense than water! Made up of ice
particles, Saturn’s rings are 250,000 km across, but only 10 meters thick! Gaps in the rings are created
the gravitational tugging of the moons orbiting Saturn. Uranus is an ice giant with a small rocky core and
a thick mantle of ammonia, water, and methane. It also has thirteen distinct rings. Uranus
has a huge tilt -- 98°, with respect to its orbit. A massive glancing collision long ago is one
hypothesis to explain the extreme tilt. Technically considered the last planet in
our solar system, Neptune is an ice giant, with a similar composition to Uranus. It’s
the most dense of the outer planets and the only planet found by mathematical prediction
rather than by empirical observation. At the outer edges of our solar system we find the
Kuiper Belt, filled with smaller rocky and icy bodies. Pluto is in this region. It was originally discovered
in 1930 and categorized as a planet, but it was recategorized as a minor planet in 2006. And there you go -- a crash course on our solar system.
Even though we've explored a lot of it, there's still a huge amount left to discover. And that's the beauty
of science: there's always more to learn. Thank you so much for watching! This video

FURTHER READING

""Once, we were all dressed by someone else. Parents picked out a T-shirt; the school dictated what colour our trousers should be. But at some point, we were granted the opportunity to discover who we might be in the world of clothes. We had to decide for ourselves about collars and necklines, fit, colours, patterns, textures and what goes (or doesn’t) with what. We learnt to speak about ourselves in the language of garments. Despite the potential silliness and exaggeration of sections of the fashion industry, assembling a wardrobe is a serious and meaningful exercise.""

Funny moments you missed from the Trump-Kim summit,"Here are some of the lighter moments from the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi. The highlights include jogging bodyguards, a Kim Jong-un lookalike being deported and Kim having a smoke break as his sister holds a crystal ashtray. Also we see Trump frantically waving a Vietnam flag and seemingly understanding Kim's jokes, even though Korean leader spoke in his native tongue. We see the pair enjoying a 'private dinner' in front of the gathered media, including one of the ""world's greatest photographers"". After the summit ended with no agreement we see Trump having an awkward moment with a bunch of flowers then stumbling slightly as enters Air Force One.

"'India a powerhouse, can't dictate..': Russia's big praise as New Delhi defies West on Ukraine","Russia has lauded India and other nations, including China, for refusing to budge before the West. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called India a powerhouse that cannot be ignored. He said the era of western dominance is over in the world. The Russian foreign minister's praise comes at a time when India has refused to join the West against Russia. India is yet to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has instead called for a dialogue. Watch the video for more.

Goliath Vs David? China & Fisherfolks Of The Philippines And Vietnam,"In June 2020 , a Chinese Coast Guard patrol vessel rammed and looted a Vietnamese fishing boat in the Paracel Islands. Acts of aggression like these from China have hindered the livelihoods of fishermen in the South China Sea, who struggle to defend their rights to fish in one of the most contested regions in the world.

Armed Chinese ships escorting Chinese fishing fleets have been known to chase, use water cannons on, capture or even set fire to fishing vessels from the Philippines and Vietnam found in waters that Beijing lays claims to within its  “nine-dash-line” boundary. These include the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, the Macclesfield Bank and the Scarborough Shoal. 

The last falls within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines, and in 2016 the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruled that China’s claim of “historical rights” to the shoal had no legal basis, and that it had violated the Philippines’ “traditional fishing rights”.

But China has ignored the ruling and its fishing fleets have continued to muscle out Filipino fishermen, who are enraged that the Duterte administration isn’t taking a stance on this matter.

How the Monkey King escaped the underworld - Shunan Teng,"Meet Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and follow his journey to the Realm of the Dead and his fierce battle to escape the underworld.

--

The Monkey King, a legendary troublemaker hatched from stone and schooled in divine magic, had stolen the Dragon Lord’s most treasured weapon: a magical staff. Returning to his kingdom to show off his treasure to his tribe of warrior monkeys, he finds himself caught in the clutches of two soul collectors, dragging him to his death. Shunan Teng details the Monkey King’s journey to the underworld.

of their underwater kingdom, the mighty Dragon Lords 
quaked with fear. Before them pranced Sun Wukong, 
the Monkey King. The legendary troublemaker been hatched 
from a stone, schooled in divine magic, and was currently brandishing 
the Dragon Lord’s most treasured weapon. This magical staff, originally large enough to measure 
the depth of a great flood, now obeyed the Monkey King’s will 
and shrank at his touch. Terrified of this bewildering power, the Dragons graciously allowed 
Sun Wukong to keep the staff. The Monkey King stowed the weapon away, and gleefully sped back to his kingdom 
to show this treasure to his tribe of warrior monkeys. After a lavish celebration, 
Sun Wukong fell into a deep sleep. But just as he began to dream, the Monkey King 
quickly realized two things. The first was that 
this was no ordinary slumber. The second was that he wasn’t alone. Suddenly, he found himself caught 
in the clutches of two grisly figures. At first the Monkey King didn’t know 
who his captors were. But as they dragged him toward 
their city’s gates, Sun Wukong realized 
his deathly predicament. These were soul collectors 
tasked with transporting mortals to the Realm of the Dead. This was the domain of the Death Lords, who mercilessly sorted souls 
and designed gruesome punishments. From here, the kingdom of death 
was laid out before him. He could see the Death Lord’s palaces, and the fabled bridge 
across the river Nai He. Manning the bridge was an old woman 
who offered worthy souls a bowl of soup. After drinking, the spirits 
forgot their previous life, and were sent back to the world 
of the living in a new form. Further below were the souls 
not worthy of reincarnation. In this twisting maze of chambers, unfortunate spirits endured 
endless rooms of punishment— from mountains spiked with sharp blades, 
to pools of blood and vats of boiling oil. But Sun Wukong was not about to accept 
torture or reincarnation. As the soul collectors attempted to drag 
him through the gates, the Monkey King whipped out his staff 
and swung himself out of their clutches. His battle cries and the clang of weapons 
echoed throughout the underworld. Sensing a disturbance, 
the ten Death Lords swooped upon him. But they had never met such resistance 
from a mortal soul. What was this unusual creature? And was he a mortal, a god— 
or something else? The Lords consulted 
the Book of Death and Life— a tome which showed the time 
of every living soul’s death. Not knowing what category 
this strange being was under, the Death Lords struggled 
to find Sun Wukong at first; but the Monkey King 
knew just where to look. Unfortunately, the records confirmed 
the Death Lord’s claim— Sun Wukong was scheduled 
to die this very night. But the Monkey King was not afraid. This was far from the first time 
he’d defied destiny in his quest for wisdom and power. His past rebellions had earned him 
the power to transfigure his body, ride clouds at dizzying speeds, and govern
his tribe with magic and martial arts. In this crisis, 
he saw yet another opportunity. With a flash of his nimble fingers, the Monkey King struck 
his own name from the Book. Before the Death Lords could respond, he found the names of his monkey tribe 
and swept them away as well. Liberated from the bonds of death, Sun Wukong began to battle 
his way out of the underworld. He deftly defeated endless swarms 
of angry spirits— before tripping on his way 
out of the kingdom. Just before he hit the ground, 
Sun Wukong suddenly awoke in his bed. At first he thought the journey 
might have been a dream, but the Monkey King felt 
his new immortality surging from the top of his head 
to the tip of his tail. With a cry of triumph, he woke his 
warriors to share his latest adventure— and commence another round 
of celebration."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",OeGJ5dnlHwI,joining me now military analysts that retired Air by Marshall Sean Bell Sean great to see you um Talk us through just the what happened we learned about this yesterday and how significant it is that they're going to be stationing these weapons there in Belarus quite sounds quite alarming whenever we're talking about nuclear weapons the rhetoric in addition to signing the deal and of course those extra aircraft um they're also positioning iskander missiles which are capable of carrying the warheads and of course they've also got to find Russia's got to find storage facilities in Belarus they're going to build those they'll be ready by July um but it's worth remembering these weapons will still be under Russian control even though they're forward deployed I'm old enough the former Soviet Union when it was around when it collapsed a lot of the weapons the nuclear weapons were forward deployed and by 1996 weapons that have been deployed in Belarus Kazakhstan and Ukraine were all back on Russian soil again so actually this move of forward deploying it's a Belarus is just reversing that Trend it's also worth noting the Americans say they're monitoring the situation but they say there's no evidence whatsoever that Russia is planning to use nuclear weapons interesting sort of relaxed response I'm sure the the polls will be wondering a little bit more nervously about things like that so talk us through though some of the other thought processes what else is happening behind the scenes to lead to this decision by the Russians well Russia has a huge nuclear Arsenal it's got nearly 6 000 nuclear weapons uh they can blow the world up several times over they can be launched from Maryland or Sea from the bombers there from submarines or from from Land base and of course over the years it's become less worry about range they use intercontinental ballistic missiles they can be based anywhere so the fact that they're forward deploying these is actually irrelevant from a actually a military perspective so this is almost certainly about messaging it's worth remembering Russia is not doing well in the war in Ukraine there's a bit of saber rattling but if we look back to this month's visit by Xi Jinping um he made very very clear to Putin at the time you know this is uh it's not about he should not deploy or use nuclear weapons in this conflict so I think actually the bigger worry here is almost certainly for Belarus um bizarrely because um Russia's made really clear Putin certainly he wants to reassimilate um Belarus back into his the former Russian Empire they've been deploying troops forward they've been mounting operations out of Belarus they've now got aircraft out of Belarus and they're now looking at mounting technical nuclear weapons there so it's a real worrying sign I think for Belarus also is there an aspect that Vladimir Putin's making this announcement for his domestic audience almost certainly I mean yesterday this uh interview okay it was on a state-owned TV channel so it was all carefully managed very confident Putin talking about the West will never be able to sustain its level of support and also we're going to have 1600 brand new main battle tanks on the uh in Russian Hands by the end of the year but if you look at the facts behind that U.S economy is 10 times the size of Russia the collective UK France Germany is five times the size uh of Russian and therefore it's easily got the capacity and in terms of how they're going to build the tanks um Russia's only Factory building tanks can build 20 a month they're losing 150 a month it's very difficult to see how they'll do the maths and even Russian commentators are turning around and saying they're going to have to open the cupboards bring more out of storage and even potentially bring the t-34 out of storage that's the 1940s that was first brought into service has no place in the battlefield whatsoever Shaheed 136 drones 71 used from Iran big pauses because Russia's running out I think despite the rhetoric that Putin's coming out with Russian industry is struggling and Russia is incred increasingly Reliance on its uh importing uh weapons from its uh few friends just quickly going back to this timing of this decision to to say they're going to station these weapons in Belarus any surprise that it came after he'd met with President XI something that President she would have said yes okay you can have my tacit approval to do something like that I think it's much simpler than that to be briefly honest I think um we've seen on the battlefield that Putin's going from offense to defense he would have hoped to have got further particularly around back boots and I think now he's really worried about what Ukraine is going to do on their counter-attack and therefore he's trying to saber rattle to try and scare the Western Community because without Western Aid Ukraine's um counter-offensive would be very difficult to mount really interesting Sean as always thanks so much
Could we build a wooden skyscraper? - Stefan Al,"Explore the viability of wooden skyscrapers, and see how cross-laminated timber (CLT) helps make these once impossible structures possible.

--

Towering 85 meters above the Norwegian countryside, Mjøstårnet is the world’s tallest wooden building, made almost entirely from the trees of neighboring forests. But as recently as the end of the 20th century, engineers thought it was impossible to build a wooden building over 6 stories tall. So how do wooden structures like this compare to steel and concrete skyscrapers? Stefan Al investigates.

Lesson by Stefan Al, directed by Franz Palomares.

countryside, Mjøstårnet cuts a sleek shape 
in the rural skyline. Housing 18 stories of restaurants,
apartments, and hotel rooms, this modern building might
seem out of place. But a deeper look reveals it actually
blends in quite well among the forested farmlands. This is likely because Mjøstårnet 
is the world’s tallest wooden building, made almost entirely from the trees
of neighboring forests. Until the end of the 20th century, engineers thought it was
impossible to build a wooden building over six stories tall. Traditional boards of lumber were fairly
strong against forces parallel to the wood’s fiber growth. But they were vulnerable to forces applied
perpendicular to this direction. As a result, wood lacked 
steel’s tensile strength or concrete’s compressive strength— each necessary to support tall buildings and battle the powerful winds found
at high altitudes. But the early 1890s saw the invention 
of glue laminated timber, or glulam. And a century later, engineers developed
cross-laminated timber, or CLT These new wooden materials start
out like all other lumber; a freshly cut log is sawed
into smooth uniform boards of wood. Then, in the case of CLT, the boards are 
glued together in alternating orientations with each layer set
at 90 degrees to its neighbors. The resulting material benefits 
from wood’s structural rigidity in every direction, allowing it to mimic the compressive
strength of concrete and bear loads up to 20 times heavier
than traditional lumber. Glulam on the other hand, glues boards
together in the same direction, forming massive beams with tensile
strength comparable to steel. Glulam isn’t as versatile as CLT, but its incredible strength 
along one direction makes it superior for load-bearing beams and columns. These engineered forms of wood could
finally compete with traditional materials while also bringing their own unique set 
of advantages. At one-fifth the weight of concrete, building with CLT requires smaller cranes,
smaller foundations, and fewer construction workers. While concrete has to undergo 
a time-intensive process of casting and curing in a mold, timber can be shaped quickly using 
computer directed cutting machines. And where concrete requires 
certain weather and timing conditions to be poured on site, engineered wood can be prefabricated
in a factory, creating standardized parts with clear
instructions for assembly. Taken together, these materials allow
for faster and quieter construction, with more biodegradable materials
and less waste. Once constructed, CLT and glulam buildings
are also more resilient to some natural disasters. An earthquake can crack concrete, 
permanently weakening an entire structure. But cracked wood panels can
be easily replaced. The same is true for fire safety. As temperatures rise in a CLT building,
the material’s outer layer will char, insulating the inner layers
for up to three hours. This is more than enough time
to evacuate most buildings, and once the smoke has settled, 
charred panels can be swapped out— unlike melted steel beams. But perhaps the biggest benefits 
of CLT and glulam are outside the construction site. Building construction is responsible 
for 11% of annual global carbon emissions, and the production of steel, concrete, 
iron, and glass are major contributors to that figure. Timber, however, is a renewable resource
that can be made carbon-neutral if trees are planted to replace 
those cut down. Wood also has low thermal conductivity, making it easier to heat and cool
buildings with less energy waste. Despite these advantages, CLT requires
vastly more lumber than traditional wooden construction. And when compared in similar quantities, neither CLT or glulam is as strong 
as steel or concrete. Even Mjøstårnet isn’t made 
entirely of wood, as it contains concrete slabs 
to reinforce the upper floors. Taken together, it’s unlikely that 
a purely wooden structure would be strong enough to support 
a 40-story building— the minimum height 
for a formal skyscraper. But even if only buildings 
under 30 stories were built from wood, it would reduce the carbon footprint 
of those structures by more than 25%. So no matter how tall these
wooden buildings rise, each one contributes to the health
of our concrete jungles."
Why U.S. and Russia are playing tug-of-war to get India on their side | WION Originals,"U.S. issued several warnings to India against the import of Russian oil, saying it was not in India's interest. India continued its energy imports from Russia and now U.S. has started taking a softer stance towards India. U.S. has now taken several opportunities to exclaim how it wishes to be India's 'best defence partner'. But why? Is Russia getting something from India that U.S. wants? Here’s a report by Shivan Chanana.

History vs. Andrew Jackson - James Fester,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/history-vs-andrew-jackson-james-fester



Andrew Jackson was both beloved and loathed during his presidency. In this imaginary courtroom, you get to be the jury, considering and weighing Jackson's part in the spoils system, economic depression, and the Indian Removal Act, as well as his patriotism and the pressures of the presidency. James Fester explores how time shapes our relationship to controversial historical figures.

Lesson by James Fester, animation by Brett Underhill.",2014-01-21T16:08:28Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,294,2944098,35562,0,2562,2023-11-07T10:51:18.692894,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gx5IyumKmDI/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,gx5IyumKmDI,"A national hero? Or public enemy number one? Historical figures are often controversial, but few were as deified or vilified in their lifetime as the seventh President of the United States. This is History vs. Andrew Jackson. ""Order, order, hm, uh, what were we...ah yes, Mr. Jackson! You stand accused of degrading the office of the presidency, causing financial collapse and wanton cruelty against American Indians. How do you plead?"" ""Now, Your Honor, I am not a big city lawyer, but I do know a few things. And I know that President Jackson was a self-made frontiersman, a great general, a real man of the people."" ""Your Honor, this 'man of the people' was a gambler, a drunk, and a brawler. Why, I've heard it said that he would fight at the drop of the hat and then drop the hat himself. I ask you, was such a man fit for the most distinguished office in the nation? Can we forget the debacle of his inauguration? Who ever heard of inviting a drunken mob into the White House? It took ages to get the upholstery clean."" ""That drunken mob, sir, was the American people, and they deserve to celebrate their victory."" ""Order, order! Now, did this celebration have pie?"" ""Very well. Mr. Jackson, is it not the case that immediately upon assuming office you introduced the spoils system, replacing hundreds of perfectly good federal employees with incompetent party loyalists?"" ""Your Honor, the President did no such thing. He tried to institute rotation in office to avoid any profiteering or funny business. It was the rest of the party who insisted on giving posts to their lackeys."" ""But Mr. Jackson complied, did he not?"" ""Now, uh, see here."" ""Moving on. Mr. Jackson, did you not help to cause the financial Panic of 1837, and the ensuing economic depression with your obsessive war against the Bank of the United States? Was not vetoing its reauthorization, as you did in 1832, an act of irresponsible populace pandering that made no economic sense?"" ""Your Honor, the gentleman has quite the imagination. That bank was just a way for rich Yanks to get richer. And all that money panic was caused when British banks raised interest rates and cut lending. To blame it on the President is preposterous, I say."" ""But if Mr. Jackson had not destroyed the National Bank, it would have been able to lend to farmers and businesses when other credit dried up, would it not?"" ""Hm, this is all highly speculative. Can we move on?"" ""Certainly, Your Honor. We now come to Mr. Jackson's most terrible offense: forcing entire tribes out of their native lands via the Indian Removal Act."" ""I resent that accusation, sir. The U.S. of A. bought that land from the Indians fair and square."" ""Do you call coercion and threats by a nation with a far more powerful army fair and square? Or signing a treaty for removing the Cherokee with a small group that didn't include their actual leaders? They didn't have time to properly supply themselves before the army came and forced them to march the Trail of Tears."" ""Now, hold on a minute. This was all Van Buren's doing after President Jackson left office."" ""But Mr. Jackson laid the groundwork and made sure the treaty was ratified. All President Van Buren had to do afterwards was enforce it."" ""Look here, Your Honor. Our government's been purchasing Indian land since the beginning, and my client was negotiating these deals even before he was President. President Jackson truly believed it was best for the Indians to get compensated for their land and move out West, where there was plenty of space for them to keep living the way they were accustomed, rather than stick around and keep butting heads with the white settlers. Some of whom, I remind our court, wanted to exterminate them outright. It was a different time."" ""And yet, even in this different time, there were many in Congress and even the Supreme Court who saw how wrong the Removal Act was and loudly opposed it, were there not?"" ""My client was under a great deal of pressure. I say, do you think it's easy governing such a huge country and keeping the Union together, when states are fixing to nullify federal laws? President Jackson barely got South Carolina to back down over those import tariffs, and then Georgia had to go discover gold and start grabbing up Cherokee land. It was either get the Indians to move or get in another fight with a state government."" ""So, you admit that Mr. Jackson sacrified moral principles to achieve some political goals?"" ""I do declare, show me one leader who hasn't."" As societies change and morals evolve, yesterday's hero may become tomorrow's villain, or vice versa. History may be past, but our understanding of it is always on trial."

Two Safeway's in downtown Portland launch new secure areas to curb shoplifting,"In an attempt to curb shoplifting, the stores launched a secured area within the store with the most ""lifted"" items — away from the exit doors.

Our Tim Gordon joins us from the Safeway in downtown Portland, and Tim Shoppers can see some of these new efforts at that store. Yeah, that's right. You know and all those Safeway and is not really talking specifics about that and we can clearly see that they and other stores are adding separate shopping and checkout areas within the stores farther away from the front doors. The shoplifting epidemic in Portland is happening in plain sight. KGW has documented people stealing armloads of products that security experts like Scott Castleman say are resold on the black market. In my career of loss prevention, I've never seen anything to the degree that we have today with the brazenness of the top of the zonian, knowing that they won't get confused, they don't even try to conceal anything anymore. If you walk into the Safeway store at SW 10th and Jefferson, you can see what they are now. Doing to try and stop it. Adding a dedicated secured area within the store for what appears to be the most lifted items. You have to pay there before you can ever get close to the exit doors. Maybe that gives security officers a better chance to stop the theft. Safeway is not talking about their strategy here or at the Safeway store in the Pearl. The two stores we found with the new more secure areas, Safeway sent us a one line response reading. Like other local businesses, we are working on ways to curtail escalating theft. To ensure the safety of our employees and foster a welcoming environment for our loyal customers, Castleman has decades of experience in security and loss prevention. He is not convinced this type of strategy will make much difference, especially if staff and security are not allowed to stop and detain people, effectively making citizens arrests as Oregon law allows. I'm telling you, the more these people start getting felony convictions, the more they're going to stop shoplifting because, again, those involved in the criminal element. Talk to other people and they know who's thoughts on crime and who's hard on something. Near the Jefferson St. Safeway is a Plaid pantry. This convenience store is one of a half dozen with security concerns that could end up closing them. The local convenience store chain is trying to avoid that. So in the past year, management has installed walk up windows like at a bank. Customers are not allowed in the stores at night. It's not efficient, it's not good customer service, but it's just the only way in certain stores that we can. Control that situation, Plaid pantries Jonathan Polonsky says there's not room in the profit margin for security guards, and employee safety always comes first. We really preach hard about de escalation, so it's pretty demoralizing when somebody literally walks in with a shopping bag ways that the associate says hi, goes through the store, loads up their bag. Walks out the door and says see you tomorrow and they're back the next day. Back at the bigger grocery stores like the gateway, Fred Meyer, we are used to seeing products locked behind plexiglass where paying customers have to wait for assistance to get to them. This is the new separate shopping areas we are seeing now at Safeway are the inconvenient reality, Castleman says. Apprehension, police response and prosecution is what's worked in the past. Attempting Jefferson Safeway. I worked there in 1992 or 1993. We got hundreds of shoplifters out of there, hundreds. But there were very few would ever come back. For Polonsky, it's safety first, but he agrees there needs to be more consequences to turn the tide on shoplifting. We have a great relationship with law enforcement, and I know they're pressed just like everybody right now, but we've got to do more to hold people accountable. And back here live showing you on incident down there at the corner of the Safeway with Portland police and ambulance on the scene right now I did reach out to Portland police and the DA's office. PPB did get back to me saying they understand the frustration. Yes they are short staffed and focused on violent crimes, gun violence, homicides, but they do get to property crimes as often as they can. They will investigate them and they will work with the DA as much as possible to prosecute as well. Ashley, back to you. All right, Tim. Thank you."

He is over the brand new home in with Hollywood Hills rather where this Powerball winner bought this home still That's what we're hearing and you know, from Alta Dina to the Hollywood Hills, you know, $25 million. There's a lot going on right here. I got to tell you. This is a huge home up here on the Hollywood hillside. And like you said This was that Alta Dina, winner from the Powerball 1.2 million. I guess he cashed it out with just under under a billion under a billion. That's with a B under a billion dollars was he walked away with he bought this $25 Million mansion. At least that's what we're hearing. And this is going to be his new home so incognito. Well maybe not so much anymore. And this is a huge home out here on the hillside. Fall I would be more of a nice small house, Maybe in Alta Dena up in the hills where the trees are. But again, you know this is what this is What this guy chose to do. Right now. There's lots of cruise outside. We see cameras. You see paparazzi. We do see a couple of people out in the front as well. Not sure if that is the actual homeowner right there. Or perhaps maybe That security but that gentleman right there has been keeping an eye on what's been going on in the front of the house pretty much since we've been here and on, so they're pretty much getting this ready for the move in condition of this new $25 million home. That the Powerball winner from out here in the Altadena area purchased in the Hollywood Hills. I'm still and skybox back to your office students. Listen, I took a look at the interior I saw earlier and it's pretty nice. Let me just tell you A drop in the bucket for this person, by the way, 25 million compared to what they got. Not a big deal. Yeah it's two points 2.5% or 2% of what is total earnings were so Yeah, I understand that, but it's just a lot of home. It's you know, maybe he's planning on doing a lot of parties. Or maybe he's bringing his whole family. Maybe they're all going to live out in this home. But it just looks like a giant house up here on the hillside, But it isn't good company. There's a lot of Really, really great folks that live up here in the hillside and you can't really see from the windows. They are obviously done that on purpose.

The science of attraction - Dawn Maslar,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-attraction-dawn-maslar

Romantic chemistry is all about warm, gooey feelings that gush from the deepest depths of the heart...right? Not quite. Actually, the real boss behind attraction is your brain, which runs through a very quick, very complex series of calculations when assessing a potential partner. Dawn Maslar explores how our five senses contribute to this mating game, citing some pretty wild studies along the way.

Lesson by Dawn Maslar, animation by TOGETHER.",2014-05-08T15:18:04Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,274,6784119,121437,0,2936,2023-11-07T10:51:34.805715,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/169N81xAffQ/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,169N81xAffQ,"We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable
things that come from the heart. But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations
within a matter of seconds that's responsible
for determining attraction. Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it? But just because the calculations
are happening in your brain doesn't mean those warm,
fuzzy feelings are all in your head. In fact, all five
of your senses play a role, each able to vote for,
or veto, a budding attraction. The eyes are the first
components in attraction. Many visual beauty standards vary
between cultures and eras, and signs of youth,
fertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated
with reproductive fitness. And when the eyes spot
something they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne. It's able to pick up
on natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only convey important physical or genetic information
about their source but are able to activate a physiological
or behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of women at different points
in their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights. After male volunteers
were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,
or a new unworn one, saliva samples showed
an increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn
by an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules,
which are used to fight disease. In this case, opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts
that had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those
whose MHC molecules differed from theirs. This makes sense. Genes that result in a greater
variety of immunities may give offspring
a major survival advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females
with high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,
correlated with smaller body size. While women prefer low-pitched voices
with a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size. And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment,
not realizing the study had begun, participants were asked
to briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story
about a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person
in the story as happier, more social, more generous
and better-natured than those who had held
the cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold,
stoic, and unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed
to pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange
of tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth. This magical moment is so critical
that a majority of men and women have reported losing
their attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed,
your bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose
for additional energy, not because you're in danger
but because your body is telling you that something important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates
a sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory. This might explain why people
never forget their first kiss. The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals
and evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific
rather than romantic, but the next time
you see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body
is playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful
stranger is right for you."
China and the Philippines' battle over disputed territories in the South China Sea - BBC News,"Five years ago, the Philippines won a landmark legal victory over China over disputed territories in the South China Sea - including traditional Filipino fishing grounds like Scarborough Shoal.

Despite the tribunal ruling, there has been a constant Chinese Coastguard presence there - with Filipino fishermen reporting harassment by the authorities.

Russia warns UK against supplying 'nuclear component' ammo for Ukraine | 'Will be forced to...',"Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned London against the planned delivery of depleted uranium (DU) armour-piercing tank shells to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin said that Russia would treat it as ammunition containing 'nuclear components' and would be 'forced to react' if it were supplied to Kyiv. The warning comes as Britain plans to include DU munitions in a forthcoming delivery of Challenger 2 main battle tanks to embattled Ukraine. A similar warning was issued by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu, who said the move would bring the world yet another step 'closer to a nuclear disaster.' The United Nations has already expressed alarm over the UK's plans.

Landslide hit high-risk area of Atami built on volcanic ash
https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14387233

ATAMI, Shizuoka Prefecture--The disaster that befell this seaside resort town was an accident waiting to happen, say experts citing the steep mountainside on which it is built and poor soil quality due to huge ancient deposits of volcanic ash.

Heavy rains that battered the area since July 1 exacerbated an already precarious situation, resulting in a massive mudslide July 3 that sent torrents of mud, water and debris crashing into homes and buildings in the Izusan district, claiming the lives of two people initially and leaving around 20 others missing.

Hiroshi Takebayashi, an associate professor of erosion control engineering at Kyoto University’s Disaster Prevention Research Institute, said videos of the landslide posted on social media showed a flow of dark debris containing volcanic ash.

“The videos indicate that the mud and water flowed at a rate of 30 kph,” he said. “Under normal circumstances, mud flows are not that destructive. But on this occasion, the mudslide was between 4 and 5 meters high when it came, reaching the second floors of homes.”

The mountainside upon which Atami is built is susceptible to collapse, especially during torrential downpours and typhoons, as it is made up of vast deposits of volcanic ash and rocks that melted in an ancient volcanic eruption.

The seaside town in Shizuoka Prefecture, famed for its hot springs, is surrounded by group of volcanoes, including Mount Hakone, according to Susumu Yasuda, professor emeritus of geotechnical engineering at Tokyo Denki University.

A hazard map issued by the land ministry shows that Izusan and nearby communities are designated as areas in danger from collapse and landslides.

When the magnitude 7.9 Great Kanto Earthquake devastated Tokyo and surrounding areas in 1923, a large-scale mudslide occurred near the district, according to Yasuda.

The vulnerability of the rock and soil in Atami, coupled with heavy downpours since July 1, compounded the situation, experts said.

Total rainfall through 10:30 a.m. on July 3 came to a whopping 465 millimeters, according to a rain gauge set up in the Minaguchi district of Atami, which is located in the vicinity of Izusan.

As a result, the Izusan district and nearby areas faced a greater risk of landslides, given the recent heavy rainfall and vulnerability of the surface soil.",2021-08-03T05:34:17Z,UCMKvT0YVLufHMdGLH89J1oA,News & Politics,128,8401748,34029,0,2953,2023-11-07T10:51:28.793079,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IiXYKT3KgCY/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,IiXYKT3KgCY,It's pretty good!

named Lok Ta Moni Eysei. He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, 
the brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely
manifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose 
heart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift 
upon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was,
he announced a contest: whoever first brought back 
a glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun 
and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf 
or blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking 
the precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently 
with a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply
wringing out the fabric over her glass. Proud of all his students, 
and loving them like his own children, Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts. He turned the dew Ream Eyso 
collected into a diamond axe, Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger, and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball 
unlike anything ever seen. Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous 
and decided he must have Mekhala’s prize. He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess
so they could get the precious gem. But after she rejected their advances 
and flew off, Ream Eyso resolved 
to take the crystal ball by force. Ream Eyso flew through the air 
in search of Moni Mekhala, propelled on by a jealous rage. On his way, he encountered Vorachhun 
and attacked him, knowing that the righteous prince would
never allow him to steal the crystal. The demon gained the upper hand 
in the heat of battle, and hurled Vorachhun 
against the side of a mountain. Sure of Vorachhun’s death, Ream Eyso continued his search
until he finally found Moni Mekhala. He demanded that she 
and her friends either submit to him, the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students 
and rightful master of the crystal ball, or die like Vorachhun. Mekhala, without fear, 
refused and flew off into the clouds, hoping to draw the demon away
from her friends. Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through
nimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit. Once far enough away, 
Mekhala confronted her pursuer. Ream Eyso made one last demand 
but the goddess remained unfazed. Enraged, he began 
to swing his diamond axe. Before he could hurl the weapon,
Mekhala threw her crystal into the air. As it climbed the height of the sky, it emitted powerful flashes 
of lightning that blinded the demon. Ream Eyso let his axe loose 
in wild desperation. As the weapon flew through the air 
it cut through clouds, creating deep, rolling peals of thunder. And when the lightning and thunder mixed, precious seeds 
of water fell from heaven: rain. Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, 
now blind and impotent without his axe. She pondered what
she should do to the murderer. Remembering the kindness 
and love of her teacher, Moni Mekhala chose compassion 
and flew into the sky. Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his 
strength, found his axe, and followed her. Thunder, lightning, and rain continued 
to dance across the earth. Some drops fell on Vorachhun
and revived him, his skin golden like 
a rice field ready for harvest. Grabbing his magic dagger, he flew into the sky in search 
of Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala."

you often think of a conflict over land. But here in Southeast Asia lies
what’s known as the South China Sea. And if you want to know who
controls the waters, well, good luck. It’s going to depend
on who you ask. These are all of the countries that
claim a piece of the South China Sea. Well except China, which
claims nearly all of it. And in recent years, China doubled down on that claim
by building man-made islands with military facilities. In 2017 alone, these construction
projects covered 72 acres. These new islands have made surrounding nations
and even the United States pretty nervous. So what is it about this small body of
water that makes it so desirable? For one, it’s a massive shipping
passage with $5.3 trillion worth of trade cruising through its waters every year. That’s nearly one-third of
all global maritime trade. Second, is well, what’s
below the surface. Lots and lots of oil
and natural gas. How much exactly? The U.S. estimates there’s
11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas in the South China Sea. While one Chinese government-owned oil
company actually put the figure closer to 125 billion barrels of oil and 500 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas in undiscovered areas. And when you think China consumes
about 4.5 billion barrels of oil annually. Well, that could potentially mean
several decades worth of energy. So it’s understood why the South China Sea is
one of the most disputed places on the planet, but why is its ownership left
open for interpretation? According to international law,
every country has the right to claim up to 12 nautical miles
from its coast as its territory. Meanwhile, a country can claim
an exclusive economic zone extending up to 200 nautical miles,
for things like mining or fishing. That’s the law most governments around
the South China Sea are following. But China’s government says they
have an exception - the nine-dash line. The nine-dash line, originally the 11-dash line, first
appeared on a Chinese map about 70 years ago. Now, Beijing argues this serves as historical evidence that it has a claim to up to 90% of the contested waters. The line is less than 200 miles away from some coastal
areas of Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Yet, it reaches as far as 1,200 miles
from the south of Mainland China. So that’s why in 2016, an international tribunal voted
against China, saying it has no legal basis for its claims. Most of the region welcomed the
news, but the Chinese government pretty much pretended
the ruling never happened, building more artificial
islands and bases since. American allies in the area might
hope that the U.S. will get involved. But Chinese officials recently gave
the Trump administration a warning, the more ships the U.S. brings to the contested
waters, the more China will step up its presence."

The movement that inspired the Holocaust - Alexandra Minna Stern and Natalie Lira,"Trace the history of the eugenics movement in the US, and discover how the belief in ideal genetics led to forced sterilizations.

--

Since ancient Greece, humans have controlled populations via reproduction, retaining some traits and removing others. But in the 19th century, a new scientific movement dedicated to this endeavor emerged: eugenics. Scientists believed they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits were passed down. Alexandra Minna Stern and Natalie Lira detail the history of eugenics in the US.

her nine children when her oldest daughter 
was picked up by local authorities. Andrea Garcia had been accused
of skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible 
for juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital. After being administered an IQ test
and assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict. They told Sara her 19-year-old daughter
would be sterilized to prevent passing on what the state saw
as a mental deficiency. This horrific tale may sound like a story
from an authoritarian regime. But in fact, it took place 
in Southern California in 1938. And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands
of poor women of color targeted by the state’s relentless
campaign of eugenics. Since ancient Greece, there have been
efforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some
traits and removing others. But in the 19th century, the discovery
of evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement 
dedicated to this endeavor. In 1883, British scientist 
Sir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word
for “to be well born.” This wave of modern eugenicists 
included prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed
they could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits
were passed down. However, their definition of what traits 
were and were not desirable was largely determined 
by the prejudices of their era. Entire categories of people 
were considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color
and people with disabilities. Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard 
reflected the movement’s members: white Europeans
of Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent. As the influence of eugenics spread
in the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration
and outlawed interracial unions. These measures to improve so-called
“racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion
in Nazi Germany. The Nazi eugenics campaign 
systematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men, 
and people with disabilities. Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected
similar standards across the globe. Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden, 
Canada, and Japan forcibly sterilized
thousands of individuals. Sterilization was exceptionally common
in the US. From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization 
of over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws 
that mandated sterilization for men and women 
deemed “mentally defective.” This label was typically applied based 
on superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally
biased against most immigrant populations. These racist standards were particularly
problematic in California. From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were 
59% more likely to be sterilized than other women. And the rate of sterilizations
in California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third
of the country’s sterilization operations. Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands 
of individuals with similar fates. With the help of famed civil rights lawyer
David Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued 
that California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights 
to equal protection under the law. However, while one of the three judges
overseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not. Records suggests it’s possible 
Andrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims 
of these policies did not. Although eugenics acquired negative
connotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including
sterilization, continued for decades. By the late 1960s, research 
into human genetics was more nuanced, and bioethics had begun 
to blunt eugenics’ influence. Yet Sweden and the US continued 
to pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s. Finally, class action lawsuits and protest
marches in the US galvanized lawmakers, and California’s sterilization laws 
were finally repealed in 1979. Unfortunately today, the legal and illegal sterilization 
of many oppressed communities still continues around the globe."
The surprising reason our muscles get tired - Christian Moro,"Why do our muscles get tired and sore after exercise? Explore how our muscles function, and how you can exercise longer without experiencing muscle fatigue.

You're lifting weights. The first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort until you can’t continue. Inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting have become unable to contract. What’s going on? Christian Moro explains how exactly our muscles operate, and what causes them to become fatigued.

The first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort 
until you can’t continue. Inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting
have become unable to contract. Why do our muscles get fatigued? We often blame lactic acid 
or running out of energy, but these factors alone don’t account 
for muscle fatigue. There’s another major contributor: the muscle’s ability to respond 
to signals from the brain. To understand the roots of muscle fatigue, it helps to know how a muscle contracts 
in response to a signal from a nerve. These signals travel from the brain to the
muscles in a fraction of a second via long, thin cells called motor neurons. The motor neuron and the muscle cell 
are separated by a tiny gap, and the exchange of particles 
across this gap enables the contraction. On one side of the gap, the motor neuron contains a 
neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. On the other side, charged particles, or ions, line the muscle cell’s membrane: potassium on the inside, 
and sodium on the outside. In response to a signal from the brain, the motor neuron releases acetylcholine, which triggers pores on the muscle 
cell membrane to open. Sodium flows in, and potassium flows out. The flux of these charged particles 
is a crucial step for muscle contraction: the change in charge creates an electrical
signal called an action potential that spreads through the muscle cell, stimulating the release of calcium
that’s stored inside it. This flood of calcium causes 
the muscle to contract by enabling proteins buried in the muscle 
fibers to lock together and ratchet towards each other, pulling the muscle tight. The energy used to power the contraction
comes from a molecule called ATP. ATP also helps pump the ions back 
across the membrane afterward, resetting the balance of sodium 
and potassium on either side. This whole process repeats 
every time a muscle contracts. With each contraction, energy in the form of ATP gets used up, waste products like lactic 
acid are generated, and some ions drift away from the muscle’s
cell membrane, leaving a smaller and 
smaller group behind. Though muscle cells use up ATP as they 
contract repeatedly, they are always making more, so most of the time even heavily fatigued muscles still 
have not depleted this energy source. And though many waste products are acidic, fatigued muscles still maintain pH 
within normal limits, indicating that the tissue is effectively
clearing these wastes. But eventually, over the course of 
repeated contractions there may not be sufficient concentrations
of potassium, sodium or calcium ions immediately available near 
the muscle cell membrane to reset the system properly. So even if the brain sends a signal, the muscle cell can’t generate the action
potential necessary to contract. Even when ions like sodium, 
potassium or calcium are depleted in or around the muscle cell, these ions are plentiful 
elsewhere in the body. With a little time, they will flow back to the areas 
where they’re needed, sometimes with the help of active sodium
and potassium pumps. So if you pause and rest, muscle fatigue will subside as these ions
replenish throughout the muscle. The more regularly you exercise, the longer it takes for muscle fatigue 
to set in each time. That’s because the stronger you are, the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal
from the brain to contraction in the muscle
has to be repeated to lift a certain amount of weight. Fewer cycles means slower ion depletion, so as your physical fitness improves, you can exercise for longer 
at the same intensity. Many muscles grow with exercise, and larger muscles also 
have bigger stores of ATP and a higher capacity to clear waste, pushing fatigue even 
farther into the future."

Casselton, North Dakota
December 30, 2013
DCA14MR004

The video comes from the forward-facing on-board image recorders from the two trains involved in the accident. Video from the Grain Train lead locomotive 6990 was downloaded from the undamaged GE Lococam on-board image recorder. Parametric data from the Grain Train lead locomotive 6990 was downloaded from the undamaged event recorder. Video from the Crude Oil Train lead locomotive 4934 was obtained from data transmitted wirelessly when the emergency brakes were applied, and parametric data was downloaded from the trailing distributed power unit locomotive 6684.

The video begins at 14:08:37 Central Standard Time (CST) with the view from the front of the Grain Train as it travels westbound on main track 1. The text “Grain Train #6990” and the speed of the train are displayed at the bottom center of the screen. The westbound direction of travel is briefly indicated by a text annotation. The train passes a track switch and a vehicle belonging to a signal maintainer at 14:09:06; the vehicle is labeled by a text annotation for about 10 seconds as the train approaches the vehicle. The front end of the crude oil train begins to be visible on the adjacent track to the left at about 14:09:41, and it is labeled with a text annotation. The derailment of the Grain Train occurs at 14:09:57, after which time a digital counter is shown on the right in the image, indicating the time in seconds since the derailment. A text annotation indicates that the emergency brakes on the Grain Train were applied at 14:10:13, uncommanded by the train crew. At 14:10:33, the lead locomotive of the Crude Oil Train passes the lead locomotive of the Grain Train.

At 14:11:02, the video switches to the view from the front of the Crude Oil Train as it travels eastbound on main track 2. The text “Crude Oil Train #4934” and the speed of the train are displayed at the bottom center of the screen. The eastbound direction of travel is briefly indicated by a text annotation. A text annotation indicates an engineer-induced emergency brake application on the Crude Oil Train occurred at 14:11:03. A
text annotation also points out the 45th car in the Grain Train, which is fouling main track 2. The Crude Oil Train strikes the 45th car in the Grain Train at 14:11:12, leading to derailment of the Crude Oil Train, which departs main track 2 to the right and apparently comes to rest once impacting the built-up ballast supporting a parallel set of railroad tracks.

The video includes an audio overlay of radio traffic broadcast over radio channel 70, with communications from the Grain Train, the Crude Oil Train, the dispatcher and the signal maintainer passed by the Grain Train at 14:09:06. The audio begins with a call from the signal maintainer to the crew of the Grain Train at 14:10:31, and ends at 14:11:59 after the crew of the Crude Oil Train have reported the derailment and subsequent fire to the dispatcher.",2017-02-07T14:54:45Z,UCe5dWbxxvQqDAHmyMrEF7Kw,Education,217,7396817,33439,0,3359,2023-11-07T10:51:54.597801,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZhraoVIJ1OE/hqdefault.jpg,,ZhraoVIJ1OE,[Music]
Bhutan shocks India with pro-China stand on Doklam; Alarm in New Delhi | Explained,"The Bhutanese PM's China comment over the Doklam dispute has raised concerns in India. Six years after Indian and Chinese soldiers clashed in Doklam, the Bhutanese PM has said that Beijing has an 'equal say in finding a resolution to the dispute.' The statement marks a significant shift in Bhutan's stand amid an ongoing dispute. Remember, India believes the high-altitude plateau has been illegally occupied by China. Interestingly, the declaration by Tshering comes a few months after Bhutanese and Chinese officials met in Kunming, China, to discuss a 'three-step roadmap' to settle border disputes. The statement has triggered a fear of Bhutan ceding its land near strategic tri-junction point to China. Watch this video, which explains it all.

Why do some people go bald? - Sarthak Sinha,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-some-people-go-bald-sarthak-sinha

What do Charles Darwin, Michael Jordan, and Yoda have in common? They, like many other historical and fictive individuals, are bald. Scientists have long pondered, why do some people lose their hair, and how can we bring it back? Sarthak Sinha explores the basics of baldness.

Lesson by Sarthak Sinha, animation by Brett Underhill.",2015-08-25T15:08:03Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,289,3403222,61331,0,3608,2023-11-07T10:52:11.366441,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8diYLhl8bWU/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge",8diYLhl8bWU,"What do Charles Darwin, Michael Jordan,
and Yoda have in common? They, like many other historical
and fictive individuals, are bald, in some cases by their own choice. For centuries, a shining dome has been
a symbol of intelligence, but despite this, many balding people
still wish their hair would return. Scientists have long pondered, ""Why do some people lose their hair,
and how can we bring it back?"" The full-headed among us have about
100,000 to 150,000 hairs on our scalps, and scientists have discovered two things
about this dense thicket. Firstly, the sprouting hair we see
is mostly made up of keratin, the protein leftover from dead cells
that are forced upwards as new cells grow beneath them. Secondly, the structures 
that drive hair growth are called hair follicles, a network of complex organs
that forms before we're born, and grows hair in an everlasting cycle. This cycle has three main phases. The first is anagen, the growth phase, which up to 90% of your hair follicles
are experiencing right now, causing them to push up hair
at a rate of one centimeter per month. Anagen can last for two to seven years,
depending on your genes. After this productive period, signals within the skin instruct
some follicles to enter a new phase known as catagen, or the regressing stage, causing hair follicles to shrink
to a fraction of their original length. Catagen lasts for
about two to three weeks and cuts blood supply to the follicle,
creating a club hair, meaning it's ready to be shed. Finally, hairs enter telogen,
the resting phase, which lasts for ten to twelve weeks, and affects about 
5-15% of your scalp follicles. During telogen, up to 200 club hairs
can be shed in a day, which is quite normal. Then, the growth cycle begins anew. But not all heads are hairy, and, in fact, some of them grow
increasingly patchy over time in response to bodily changes. 95% of baldness in men can
be attributed to male pattern baldness. Baldness is inherited, and in people with this condition, follicles become incredibly sensitive
to the effects of dihydrotestosterone, a hormonal product 
made from testosterone. DHT causes shrinkage 
in these overly sensitive follicles, making hair shorter and wispier. But loss isn't sudden. It happens gradually, along a metric
known as the Norwood Scale, which describes the severity of hair loss. First, hair recedes along the temples, then hair on the crown begins to thin
in a circular pattern. At the highest rating on the scale, these balding areas meet 
and expand dramatically, eventually leaving only a ring
of sparse hair around the temples and the back of the head. Genetics isn't all that drives hair loss. Long periods of stress can release
signals that shock follicles and force them into 
the resting phase prematurely. Some women experience this
after childbirth. Follicles might also lose the ability
to go into anagen, the growth phase. People going through chemotherapy
treatment temporarily experience this. But while balding may look permanent, scientific investigation 
has revealed the opposite. Below the skin's surface, the roots that give rise to our hair
actually remain alive. Using this knowledge, scientists have developed drugs
that shorten the resting phase, and force follicles into anagen. Other drugs combat male pattern baldness by blocking the conversion 
of testosterone to DHT so that it doesn't affect 
those sensitive follicles. Stem cells also play a role in regulating
the growth cycle, and so scientists are investigating
whether they can manipulate the activity of these cells to encourage
follicles to start producing hair again. And in the meantime, while scientists hone 
their hair-reviving methods, anyone going bald, 
or considering baldness, can remember that 
they're in great company."
History vs. Cleopatra - Alex Gendler,"View full lesson: ed.ted.com/lessons/history-vs-cleopatra-alex-gendler

She was the most notorious woman in ancient history, a queen who enraptured not one but two of Rome’s greatest generals. But was she just a skilled seductress – or a great ruler in her own right? Alex Gendler puts this controversial figure on trial in History vs. Cleopatra.

So who do we have here?"" ""Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen whose lurid affairs
destroyed two of Rome's finest generals and brought the end of the Republic."" ""Your Honor, this is Cleopatra, one of the most powerful women in history whose reign brought Egypt nearly
22 years of stability and prosperity."" ""Uh, why don't we even know
what she looked like?"" ""Most of the art and descriptions
came long after her lifetime in the first century BCE, just like most of 
the things written about her."" ""So what do we actually know? Cleopatra VII was the last
of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a Macedonian Greek family 
that governed Egypt after its conquest by Alexander the Great. She ruled jointly in Alexandria 
with her brother- to whom she was also married- until he had her exiled."" ""But what does all this 
have to do with Rome?"" ""Egypt had long been a Roman client state, and Cleopatra's father incurred 
large debts to the Republic. After being defeated by Julius Caesar
in Rome's civil war, the General Pompey sought refuge in Egypt but was executed 
by Cleopatra's brother instead."" ""Caesar must have liked that."" ""Actually, he found the murder unseemly
and demanded repayment of Egypt's debt. He could have annexed Egypt, but Cleopatra convinced him to restore
her to the throne instead."" ""We hear she was quite convincing."" ""And why not? Cleopatra 
was a fascinating woman. She commanded armies at 21, spoke several languages, and was educated in a city 
with the world's finest library and some of the greatest 
scholars of the time."" ""Hmm."" ""She kept Caesar lounging 
in Egypt for months when Rome needed him."" ""Caesar did more than lounge. He was fascinated by Egypt's culture
and knowledge, and he learned much during his time there. When he returned to Rome, 
he reformed the calendar, commissioned a census, made plans for a public library, and proposed many 
new infrastructure projects."" ""Yes, all very ambitious, 
exactly what got him assassinated."" ""Don't blame the Queen for Rome's
strange politics. Her job was ruling Egypt,
and she did it well. She stabilized the economy, managed the vast bureaucracy, and curbed corruption by priests
and officials. When drought hit, she opened
the granaries to the public and passed a tax amnesty, all while preserving her kingdom's
stability and independence with no revolts during 
the rest of her reign."" ""So what went wrong?"" ""After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen
couldn't stop meddling in Roman matters."" ""Actually, it was the Roman factions who
came demanding her aid. And of course she had no choice
but to support Octavian and Marc Antony in avenging Caesar,
if only for the sake of their son."" ""And again, she provided her particular
kind of support to Marc Antony."" ""Why does that matter? Why doesn't anyone seem to care about Caesar or Antony's 
countless other affairs? Why do we assume she instigated
the relationships? And why are only powerful women
defined by their sexuality?"" ""Order."" ""Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster. They offended the Republic
with their ridiculous celebrations sitting on golden thrones and dressing up as gods until Octavian had all of Rome convinced
of their megalomania."" ""And yet Octavian was the one 
who attacked Antony, annexed Egypt, and declared himself Emperor. It was the Roman's fear of a woman
in power that ended their Republic, not the woman herself."" ""How ironic."" Cleopatra's story survived mainly
in the accounts of her enemies in Rome, and later writers filled the gaps 
with rumors and stereotypes. We may never know the full truth
of her life and her reign, but we can separate fact from rumor
by putting history on trial."
The history of the Cuban Missile Crisis - Matthew A. Jordan,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-history-of-the-cuban-missile-crisis-matthew-a-jordan

Imagine going about your life knowing that, at any given moment, you and everyone you know could be wiped out without warning at the push of a button. This was the reality for millions of people during the forty-five year period after World War II now known as the Cold War. Matthew A. Jordan explains the history behind the peak of all this panic — the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Lesson by Mathew A. Jordan, animation by Patrick Smith.",2016-09-26T15:40:44Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,292,5088148,88423,0,3606,2023-11-07T10:52:04.036909,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bwWW3sbk4EU/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",bwWW3sbk4EU,"It's not hard to imagine a world
where at any given moment, you and everyone you know could be
wiped out without warning at the push of a button. This was the reality for millions
of people during the 45-year period after World War II, now known as the Cold War. As the United States and Soviet Union
faced off across the globe, each knew that the other had nuclear
weapons capable of destroying it. And destruction never loomed closer
than during the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to
overthrow Cuba's new communist government. That failed attempt was known
as the Bay of Pigs, and it convinced Cuba to seek help
from the U.S.S.R. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
was happy to comply by secretly deploying nuclear
missiles to Cuba, not only to protect the island, but to counteract the threat from
U.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey. By the time U.S. intelligence 
discovered the plan, the materials to create the missiles
were already in place. At an emergency meeting on
October 16, 1962, military advisors urged an airstrike
on missile sites and invasion of the island. But President John F. Kennedy chose
a more careful approach. On October 22, he announced that the
the U.S. Navy would intercept all shipments to Cuba. There was just one problem: a naval blockade was considered
an act of war. Although the President called it
a quarantine that did not block basic necessities, the Soviets didn't appreciate 
the distinction. In an outraged letter to Kennedy, Khrushchev wrote, ""The violation 
of freedom to use international waters and international airspace
is an act of aggression which pushes mankind toward the abyss
of world nuclear missile war."" Thus ensued the most intense
six days of the Cold War. While the U.S. demanded the removal
of the missiles, Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted
they were only defensive. And as the weapons continued
to be armed, the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion. On October 27, a spy plane piloted
by Major Rudolph Anderson was shot down by a Soviet missile. The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet
submarine was hit by a small-depth charge from a U.S. Navy vessel trying
to signal it to come up. The commanders on the sub,
too deep to communicate with the surface, thought war had begun
and prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo. That decision had to be made unanimously
by three officers. The captain and political officer
both authorized the launch, but Vasili Arkhipov, 
second in command, refused. His decision saved the day
and perhaps the world. But the crisis wasn't over. For the first time in history, the U.S. Military set itself
to DEFCON 2, the defense readiness one step
away from nuclear war. With hundreds of nuclear missiles
ready to launch, the metaphorical Doomsday Clock
stood at one minute to midnight. But diplomacy carried on. In Washington, D.C., Attorney General
Robert Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin. After intense negotiation,
they reached the following proposal. The U.S. would remove their missiles
from Turkey and Italy and promise to never invade Cuba in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal
from Cuba under U.N. inspection. Once the meeting had concluded, Dobrynin cabled Moscow saying 
time is of the essence and we shouldn't miss the chance. And at 9 a.m. the next day, a message arrived from Khrushchev announcing the Soviet missiles would be
removed from Cuba. The crisis was now over. While criticized at the time by their
respective governments for bargaining with the enemy, contemporary historical analysis
shows great admiration for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability
to diplomatically solve the crisis. But the disturbing lesson was that
a slight communication error, or split-second decision by a commander,
could have thwarted all their efforts, as it nearly did if not for 
Vasili Arkhipov's courageous choice. The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how
fragile human politics are compared to the terrifying power
they can unleash."

Where did English come from? - Claire Bowern,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/where-did-english-come-from-claire-bowern

When we talk about ‘English’, we often think of it as a single language. But what do the dialects spoken in dozens of countries around the world have in common with each other, or with the writings of Chaucer? Claire Bowern traces the language from the present day back to its ancient roots, showing how English has evolved through generations of speakers.

Lesson by Claire Bowern, animation by Patrick Smith.",2015-07-16T15:05:29Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,294,5398236,105515,0,4981,2023-11-07T10:52:30.980907,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YEaSxhcns7Y/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,YEaSxhcns7Y,"When we talk about English,
we often think of it as a single language but what do the dialects spoken
in dozens of countries around the world have in common with each other, or with the writings of Chaucer? And how are any of them related
to the strange words in Beowulf? The answer is that like most languages, English has evolved 
through generations of speakers, undergoing major changes over time. By undoing these changes, we can trace the language 
from the present day back to its ancient roots. While modern English 
shares many similar words with Latin-derived romance languages, like French and Spanish, most of those words 
were not originally part of it. Instead, they started coming 
into the language with the Norman invasion 
of England in 1066. When the French-speaking Normans
conquered England and became its ruling class, they brought their speech with them, adding a massive amount 
of French and Latin vocabulary to the English language 
previously spoken there. Today, we call that language Old English. This is the language of Beowulf. It probably doesn't look very familiar, but it might be more recognizable
if you know some German. That's because Old English
belongs to the Germanic language family, first brought to the British Isles
in the 5th and 6th centuries by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. The Germanic dialects they spoke would
become known as Anglo-Saxon. Viking invaders in the 8th 
to 11th centuries added more borrowings 
from Old Norse into the mix. It may be hard to see the roots
of modern English underneath all the words borrowed from French, Latin, Old Norse 
and other languages. But comparative linguistics can help us
by focusing on grammatical structure, patterns of sound changes, and certain core vocabulary. For example, after the 6th century, German words starting with ""p,""
systematically shifted to a ""pf"" sound while their Old English counterparts
kept the ""p"" unchanged. In another split, words 
that have ""sk"" sounds in Swedish developed an ""sh"" sound in English. There are still some English 
words with ""sk,"" like ""skirt,"" and ""skull,"" but they're direct borrowings 
from Old Norse that came after the ""sk"" to ""sh"" shift. These examples show us that just as the various Romance languages
descended from Latin, English, Swedish, German, 
and many other languages descended from their own common ancestor
known as Proto-Germanic spoken around 500 B.C.E. Because this historical language
was never written down, we can only reconstruct it 
by comparing its descendants, which is possible thanks 
to the consistency of the changes. We can even use the same process
to go back one step further, and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic
to a language called Proto-Indo-European, spoken about 6000 years ago on the Pontic steppe 
in modern day Ukraine and Russia. This is the reconstructed ancestor
of the Indo-European family that includes nearly all languages
historically spoken in Europe, as well as large parts of Southern
and Western Asia. And though it requires a bit more work, we can find the same systematic 
similarities, or correspondences, between related words in different
Indo-European branches. Comparing English with Latin, we see that English has ""t"" 
where Latin has ""d"", and ""f"" where latin has ""p""
at the start of words. Some of English's more distant relatives
include Hindi, Persian and the Celtic languages it displaced
in what is now Britain. Proto-Indo-European itself descended
from an even more ancient language, but unfortunately, this is as far back
as historical and archeological evidence will allow us to go. Many mysteries remain just out of reach, such as whether there might be a link
between Indo-European and other major language families, and the nature of the languages spoken
in Europe prior to its arrival. But the amazing fact remains that nearly
3 billion people around the world, many of whom cannot understand each other, are nevertheless speaking the same words
shaped by 6000 years of history."
"Abrams, Leopard and Challenger 2 vs. T-72: How Western Tanks Compare to Russia’s Armor | WSJ","The U.S., Germany and U.K. are sending M1 Abrams, Leopards and Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to support their war with Russia. How do these tanks measure up to the Russian T-72?  These new vehicles, along with IFVs, are set to change the dynamics of the war along the front lines. 

WSJ examines how the tanks that Kyiv will receive from its NATO allies compare with Russia’s vehicles.

Russia-Ukraine Conflict
WSJ’s latest news coverage around the 2022-2023 Russia-Ukraine conflict.

#Russia #Ukraine #WSJ",2023-01-26T17:15:55Z,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ,News & Politics,260,2159297,22735,0,4410,2023-11-07T10:52:23.349691,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gWq9P-sB6iM/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",gWq9P-sB6iM,"- [Narrator] This is the US-made Abrams, one of the three types of Western style tanks
that Ukraine is expecting from its allies. And this is the T-72, the Soviet era tank that's
been used most frequently in the war so far. As The Wall Street Journal first reported, the US Senate's allies
have agreed to send tanks to Ukraine ahead of more
intense fighting in the spring. Abrams and German-made
Leopards are being sent to Kyiv in addition to
UK made Challenger 2s. So as Ukraine says getting
a significant number of those weapons would be a game changer, here's how heavy vehicles
from the West match up to Russia's older, but
much larger tank fleet. (weapon firing) First, let's look at why Ukraine argues that tanks are so important. - So the front lines of this war have been pretty
static in the last few months. A lot of the fighting
has been taking place along these vast plains
and on small hills, and that's the kind of terrain and landscape that allows
the big military vehicles to operate pretty efficiently. - [Narrator] The two main types of armored vehicles being used in Ukraine right now are main battle tanks and infantry fighting
vehicles, also known as IFVs, tanks of heavy armor, big
guns and caterpillar treads. When tanks face each
other on the battlefield, military experts say they typically look for a weak point along
the front line to try and break through and
destroy other heavy vehicles. IFVs, on the other hand,
are smaller and lighter. They have some of the
characteristics of tanks but their main purpose is
transporting infantry safely around the battlefield while
also providing fire support with their smaller weapons. Prior to the invasion,
Ukraine had significantly fewer armored fighting
vehicles than Russia. - But now Kyiv's NATO allies are sending more modern
military vehicles to Ukraine. - Today I'm announcing that the United States will
be sending 31 Abram tanks to Ukraine, the equivalent
of one Ukrainian battalion. - [Narrator] So how will Western Tanks help Ukrainian forces? - Well, for tanks, the most important
factor is survivability. - [Narrator] Weapons experts
measure this by estimating how resistant the vehicles
are to anti-tank weapons, like the US-made Javelin
or the Russian Kornet, as well as armor-piecing
rounds fired by other tanks. Analysts say the Challenger
2 and Abrams tanks, which were both used in the Iraq war, are some of the most
protected tanks in the world. That's because they both
have a composite armor called Chobham. It uses a combination of steel, ceramics and other materials to create
particularly resistant plates. Military analysts say
this protection gives them a major advantage over the T-72, over 500 of which have
been destroyed so far in the Ukraine war. German-made Leopard tanks don't use that same armor technology but have other similar characteristics to the Abrams and Challenger 2, all three types of
advanced computer systems and modern 120 millimeter guns. Military analysts say
they're less vulnerable than the gun on the T-72,
which hold this ammunition at the bottom of the turret. On the ground, the tanks,
which are expensive, and fewer number will also
get some extra support. - Other armored vehicles
are just as important and the US has also promised to deliver 50 M2 Bradley
fighting vehicles to Ukraine. - The Bradley has a number of modern advantages,
including thermal imaging quicker reload times, and
an armor that's believed to be more resistant than
the Russian equivalents. That includes the Soviet era BMP-2, which have been commonly
used in the war so far. Hundreds of these vehicles
have been destroyed in Ukraine according to the
military tracking site Oryx, while the US says only
three Bradleys were lost in the Iraq war. (soldiers speaking in foreign language) But once Ukraine's forces get new tanks, using them effectively won't be easy. Many of these systems
use different ammunition and require their own
maintenance schedules. - It's still going to take a few months to set up the supply
chains, the fuel lines and the trained crews needed for the Ukraine to take
advantage of these weapons. And the few amounts that
have been promised so far make it unlikely that it's going to impact
the war anytime soon. - [Narrator] Battlefield conditions could also reduce their effectiveness. The Western systems are heavier, meaning that they can be more limited when in boggy areas and crossing bridges. Although its fleet is
aging and diminished, Moscow has hundreds more
tanks in storage centers. Ukraine, on the other hand,
says it needs 300 tanks to push back Russian forces, many more than the initial shipments
expected from the West."
East Palestine resident refuses to sign ‘hold harmless’ form | Rush Hour,"Just weeks after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, some residents are being asked to sign contracts they fear could prevent them from suing later on. Catlyn Schwarzwaelder says Norfolk Southern came by to test for toxins in her home but before doing so, she was asked to sign a document. It states that the landowner agrees to “hold harmless” for “any and all legal claims, personal injury or property damage.""

Professor Goemans a very warm welcome. You study War and how wars end as Ukraine marks this grim anniversary of Russia's full scale war. What were you most struck by and did you imagine it could go on for as long as it is, as it has This is several things that were quite striking. But let me begin that I already predicted in early March last year that this war would go on for a long time. Yes, indeed. And this is the first anniversary, but probably not the last anniversary of ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Based on on your field of study, war termination how wars and how do you see this war evolving? And crucially, what will it take to bring this war to an end? Well, if you permit me, I'll take a step back to give a kind of an overview of how I think about these issues. So very few wars end in total, utter defeat of one set of the other and not the First World War. And this war is not going to end in the defeat of the Russians in Moscow, nor is it going to end in the defeat of Ukrainian forces in Kiev. So it must enter into some form of negotiated settlement. The question you got to ask yourself then is what does war do that make? What was a disagreement turn into agreement? And the answer is very straightforward and simple. War provides information. You learn things on the battlefield that you cannot learn in any other way. And we are still in the midst of this process of that of both sides trying to learn how strong the other is and how and how committed they are to fight for the long run. So Putin is trying to targets the civilian population. The strategy has been used in many other wars, always failed. Putin is trying to target the support for the Ukrainians in the West. And if that fails, of course, the fighting becomes much too difficult for the Ukrainians. So he's you know, he's trying to try to suss out how long support is in order to find out more or less how the war is going to end. But there are a couple of problems in this case. We all say loud and clear that this war will go on for a long time. One, no deal is tenable that the Russians can offer. And, you know, the irony of this case is that any deal that leaves Russia in some control of some territory, Ukraine will only be accepted by Ukraine if Ukraine gets guarantees for its brutal future security. And the only group of countries that can do that is Naito. Of course, that's the very reason why Putin supposedly went to war for Ukraine being supported or joining Naito. So that's one reason Putin cannot credibly promise to stick by any any any demands or any settlement he makes now. He didn't do it in 2014. He won't do it now. Second, there is the problem and there's a bit of a debate over this, whether Putin can actually domestically survive a loss in the war, because if he can't, then he can anticipate that if he loses, he will be punished for his performance he will be jailed and help or most likely fall from a window in the third story of some building in the Kremlin. He will get killed. I assume that is most like now. He can anticipate this as leaders have done throughout history. The most prominent example is the First World War. You can anticipate that if he signs a losing peace or a war, that an agreement that is not worth the cost of the that the Russians have suffered, that he will be removed from office and subsequently killed. So he's not going to sign any agreement like that. He's going to fight in what we call a gamble for a resurrection. He has nothing to lose. No, he cannot die more than once. A whole month. I mean, it's a daunting prospect, too, to think that this war will drag on specifically, of course, for Ukrainians who are suffering so dearly. But what does this mean from a global perspective? In a few words, what are the chances that this war could spread beyond Ukraine? In the next couple of months or years? Well, this ties into the point I made earlier in a nice way, right? I mean, if Putin thinks that he cannot get what he needs, he may go for Moldova to say like, okay, not only did we liberate the four provinces of Ukraine, we also liberated the Russian population in Moldova and tried to sell that as a victory back home. He might try to do that."

While in Japan I noticed vending machines everywhere. Looking into it a little deeper a discovered that there's a very interesting answer to why Japan has so many vending machines. It's an economic story but it's also a story about how Japanese society values robotics and automation. 

I even found a business card vending machine: https://youtu.be/Ogb7FyzQhbk

That's the highest vending machine per capita on the planet. After the business card fiasco I started to become keenly aware of all the vending machines that I saw here in Japan. I noticed:  they are everywhere! Indeed, what we're looking at here is a Japanese institution. Behind me sits an entire shop dedicated to chopsticks. Yes, I'm about to go inside. The first thing you have to know in order to understand the vending machines, is that Japan is an aging country. The average age here is 46 years old, which is almost double the world average. And the fertility rate is 1.4 which means the population is actually shrinking. This is actually a looming crisis for Japan generally, but one of the effects of it is that the labor market is very expensive. There's a scarcity of low-skilled labor. So, instead of paying a sales clerk to sit and collect your money when you buy a piece of gum, they just put it in a machine and automate the whole thing. And the same goes for real estate. Japan is one of the densest countries in the world. 93 percent of the population lives in cities. People literally live in apartment smaller than your SUV. So instead of paying a lot of money for a store front, retailers will just slip a little machine into an alleyway to save a lot of money and they can still turn a really good profit. According to one essay that I read from a Japanese economist here in Tokyo, the bigger explanation for the vending machines is a fascination or even an obsession with automation and robotics. Everything that can be automated here, is automated. When I go into order like a ramen or breakfast, more often than not i order on a machine and I give a little ticket to someone. It's indicative of a broader cultural trend of wanting to automate every system you possibly can. Every taxi in Tokyo has automated doors that the driver controls. I don't want to overstate this. There's still a major appreciation for handcrafted artisanal goods here in Japan. A good example of this is the seven-year-old coffee shop I just got out of, where they literally use a weighted scale to weigh their coffee beans before grinding them and brewing them to order To cool down their coffee they put it into a metal vessel and spin it around a giant ice cube. So yes, they love automation but they're still very much in touch with the handmade. So another thing that totally contributes is this: coinage. So much coinage. The one big caveat to the whole automation thing is that they haven't really gotten on board with credit cards yet. Everything is cash based. And because of that you always have coinage. One of their highest coin is worth like five dollars and let's be honest: there's nothing more satisfying than unloading some of the change in your pocket into a vending machine for some yummy treat. My personal favorite item is hot green tea comes out wonderfully warm and you just wonder how you got so lucky. So Japan is an aging nation with expensive labor and a love for robots and too many coins in its pocket"

When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner, you’ve probably heard the advice, “Be more confident!” But where does confidence come from, and how can you get more of it? Here are three easy tips to boost your confidence.

Lesson by TED-Ed, animation by Kozmonot Animation Studio.",2015-10-06T15:01:46Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,257,9615280,255603,0,5366,2023-11-07T10:52:39.908618,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l_NYrWqUR40/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,l_NYrWqUR40,"Translator: Jennifer Cody
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems
to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: ""Be more confident."" And most likely, this is what you think
when you hear it: ""If only it were that simple."" But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable,
worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes
when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously 
to face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors 
that impact confidence. One: what you're born with,
such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance
of neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures
of your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about 
and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle
these three factors, but the personal choices we make
certainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind 
a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate
our own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you
an immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success 
when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music
with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose
or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: 
believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think 
about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,
like a muscle? These beliefs matter because
they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents
are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered 
something you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset
and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity
to learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get
stronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset
are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better 
in the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by
twelve different publishers before one picked up ""Harry Potter."" The Wright Brothers built on history's
failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly
and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond 
to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try 
different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge 
you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, 
stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that
whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge
and understanding. This is confidence."

Has anyone ever told you, “Stand up straight!” or scolded you for slouching at a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying—but they’re not wrong. Your posture is the foundation for every movement your body makes and can determine how well your body adapts to the stresses on it. Murat Dalkilinç gives the pros of good posture.

""Stand up straight!"" or scolded you for slouching
at a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying,
but they're not wrong. Your posture, the way you hold your body
when you're sitting or standing, is the foundation for every movement
your body makes, and can determine how well your body
adapts to the stresses on it. These stresses can be things 
like carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position. And the big one we all experience 
all day every day: gravity. If your posture isn't optimal, your muscles have to work harder
to keep you upright and balanced. Some muscles will become tight
and inflexbile. Others will be inhibited. Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair your body's ability 
to deal with the forces on it. Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear
on your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, 
like your lungs, less efficient. Researchers have linked 
poor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive 
cause of any of them. Posture can even influence 
your emotional state and your sensitivity to pain. So there are a lot of reasons
to aim for good posture. But it's getting harder these days. Sitting in an awkward position 
for a long time can promote poor posture, and so can using computers 
or mobile devices, which encourage you to look downward. Many studies suggest that, on average,
posture is getting worse. So what does good posture look like? When you look at the spine 
from the front or the back, all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked
in a straight line. From the side, the spine
should have three curves: one at your neck, one at your shoulders,
and one at the small of your back. You aren't born with this s-shaped spine. Babies' spines just have one curve like a ""c."" The other curves usually develop
by 12-18 months as the muscles strengthen. These curves help us stay upright
and absorb some of the stress from activities like walking and jumping. If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front 
of your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle. This keeps your center of gravity
directly over your base of support, which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue
and muscle strain. If you're sitting, 
your neck should be vertical, not tilted forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed
with your arms close to your trunk. Your knees should be at a right angle
with your feet flat on the floor. But what if your posture isn't that great? Try redesigning your environment. Adjust your screen so it's at
or slightly below eyelevel. Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, 
are supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to. Try sleeping on your side
with your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs. Wear shoes with low heels
and good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls. It's also not enough 
to just have good posture. Keeping your muscles and joints moving
is extremely important. In fact, being stationary for long periods
with good posture can be worse than regular movement
with bad posture. When you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you're carrying
close to your body. Backpacks should be in contact 
with your back carried symetrically. If you sit a lot, get up and move around
on occassion, and be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them
strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits 
to your joints, bones, brain and heart. And if you're really worried,
check with a physical therapist, because yes, 
you really should stand up straight."
