03XNckgtyQI,Pohang Class Corvette for the Philippine Navy Will South Korea provide just one case?,"The Soutu Korean government will be handing over the Pohang-class Flight IV corvette, the former ROKS Andong, to the Philippine Navy before June 2022, according to Defense Sec. Delfin Lorenzana, who also confirmed that the corvette wad in return for buying 2 new corvettes from South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries.

This appears to be faster than the entire transfer process for the former ROKS Chungju, which became BRP Conrado Yap.

Since the ROKS Andong was in favor of buyi g 2 new corvettes from HHI, the DND should have negotiated better, considering Indonesia is said to be getting 3 Pohang-class corvettes too.

0ZzqaU6fJR8,"China, ASEAN to Formulate Strategic Partnership Vision toward 2030","China proposes the formulation of a vision for strategic partnership between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) toward the year 2030 to upgrade cooperation, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Monday. 

Chairing the 20th China-ASEAN (10+1) leaders' meeting in Manila with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Li said the vision will upgrade the China-ASEAN cooperation framework from 2+7 to 3+X. 

The 3+X, using the letter X in math to represent the unknown, means China-ASEAN will touch many fields while focusing on three pillars -- political security, economy and trade, and people-to-people exchange. 

The current 2+7 framework emphasizes a two-point political consensus of enhancing strategic trust and promoting economic cooperation and seven cooperation fields including trade facilitation, interconnectivity, security exchanges, among others. 

Li said China-ASEAN cooperation will have more global substance and build a new exemplar for South-South cooperation. 

The Chinese premier said it is a consensus of the ASEAN nations that China-ASEAN relationship is the most vibrant and has the richest contents among the relationships ASEAN has with its partners.

China was the first major country outside the bloc to endorse the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, to form a strategic partnership with ASEAN, and to start free trade area talks with it. 

Li said China has, as always, given priority to its relations with ASEAN in neighborhood diplomacy and is committed to being ASEAN's good friend and good neighbor who can work together to tide over difficult times and strive for a community of shared future with common ideals, prosperity and responsibility. 

On Monday, he proposed the alignment of the Belt and Road Initiative with the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 to deepen China-ASEAN cooperation in such areas as trade, finance, infrastructure, rules and regulations, and personnel. 

Li said China and ASEAN should conduct closer high-level exchanges, strengthen policy dialogue, deepen political security cooperation to advance mutual understanding and trust. 

He urged all ASEAN nations to ratify the upgraded China-ASEAN free trade area (FTA) agreement as soon as possible so as to bring benefits to both sides at an early date. 

Advances should be made in Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations, implementation of key international industrial capacity cooperation projects, financial cooperation between China and ASEAN, he added. 

On people-to-people exchanges, Li said China will provide government scholarships to more than 20,000 ASEAN students in the next three years. China will offer training courses to 3,000 candidates from ASEAN in 2018 and boost cooperation in capacity building in such areas as finance, agriculture, science and technology, culture, public administration and transportation.

Li said China agrees to designate the year of 2018 as the China-ASEAN Year of Innovation and will, in the coming five years, invite 500 young ASEAN scientists to China for short-term scientific research projects, train 1,200 ASEAN scientific research and management personnel and launch 10 joint research labs. 

Li also said China has also proposed the leaders' meeting to announce the start of consultations on the text of the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea.

2WzCVRrtLhI,Virtual Dinner Chat: China-Philippines Relations and U.S. Strategic Calculus,"The Jamestown Foundation is proud to present a private Zoom webinar event on “China-Philippines Relations and the Strategic U.S. Calculus.”

The United States has increasingly turned its attention toward countering Chinese activity in the Indo-Pacific. But under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines, one of the U.S.’s main strategic partners in the region, has grown closer with China. Duterte has been lured by the prospect of easy Chinese financing—much of it through the Belt and Road Initiative—for local development projects that often serve domestic political ends. But his preference for the authoritarian China has run up against countervailing pressures both within his government and throughout civil society more broadly that are concerned about growing Chinese influence and control.

As the Indo-Pacific becomes a hot spot for strategic competition between China and the U.S., Chinese maritime militias have also continued to test the Philippines’ sovereignty of disputed territories. Notably, Duterte rejected U.S. assistance during the most recent stand off between Chinese fishing vessels and Filipino security forces at Whitsun Reef earlier this year. Even as support has grown to end Manila’s accommodative posture towards Beijing, Duterte has remained slow to improve relations with the United States. Instead, he has walked a fine and at sometimes contradictory line between the two great power states.

The Jamestown Foundation has invited the former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific, Dave Stilwell, along with Professor Renato Cruz de Castro of De La Salle University in Manila and Derek Grossman from the RAND Institute to discuss the strategic implications of the triangular relationship between the U.S., China and the Philippines.",0,foxy [Music] foreign good morning to everyone in asia and good evening to those of you who are watching online on the united states my name is glenn howard i'm president of the jamestown foundation and i'd like to welcome you to jamestown's first ever virtual dinner chat our discussion tonight is about china philippine relations in the u.s strategic calculus we're delighted to present to you with the discussion on a topic that is a renewed and growing importance just this week the philippine coast guard announced a challenge the chinese warship that entered the territory the country's territorial waters in the south china sea near maria louis bank this area is a little less than 150 nautical miles off the coast of pelham province the incident occurred one day after the fifth anniversary of a landmark ruling by an international court of arbitration affirming manila's rights to its territories in the south china sea and declare most of beijing's claims to be contested to the contested areas is baseless china has never accepted this ruling and continues to pursue its claims which are also disputed by brunei malaysia taiwan and vietnam u.s secretary of state anthony blinken took the opportunity the tribunal ruling anniversary to reaffirm the u.s commitment to defend the philippines armed forces from an attack in the south china sea under the terms of a 70-year-old mutual defense treaty china has consistently intensified its aggression in the south china sea and tensions in the south china sea have remained high although duterte remains honestly popular and highly popular at home his embrace of china and reluctance to criticize its maritime policy have opened him up to criticism even including recent rumors that chinese influence may have played a role duterte's past political victories the philippines in turn has walked a fine line and at times contradictory line between great powers in the indo-pacific as the region becomes a hot arena for strategic competition between the us and china relations between both sides and the philippines will be closely scrutinized in a lot of these developments i will now pass the baton over to jamestown's china brief editor elizabeth chen who will introduce our guests tonight and begin what will be a most interesting discussion elizabeth it's the floor is yours ben thank you very much for that um i'm just going to quickly introduce our speakers in the order they're going in and then um we're also going to leave a little bit of room for questions and answers at the end so i will ask audience participants to um uh just type any questions you have into the q a function and we'll try and get to those possible uh without further ado first up is going to be professor renato cruz de castro who is currently teaching at de la salle university in manila where he holds the dr aurelio calderon chair in philippian-american relations he's had a long and distinguished career in both academia and government and he writes a monthly column for the philippine star in business world he's frequently cited as an expert on the philippines defense and foreign policy and security relationships as well speaking next is going to be derek grossman who once served as a china brief editor but is now a senior defense analyst at the rand corporation mr grossman's current research interests include china's relationships with taiwan vietnam japan india pakistan the pacific islands and the koreas he's also previously worked in the intelligence community for over the decade in the u.s intelligence community for over a decade lastly um david's who most recently served as assistant secretary for state for the bureau of east asian and pacific affairs up until the early part of this year before he was at state mr stovall directed the china strategic focus group at the u.s indo-pacific command and also had a 35-year career in the air force which included multiple tours of duty as a linguist fighter pilot and commander in japan and korea he also served as defense attache at the u.s embassy in beijing from 2011 to 2013. so without further ado uh renato i'll let you take it away from here hey uh good morning for those who are here in southeast asia or asia good evening for those who are any skills so my presentation would look at philippine china relation in terms of the broad strokes and of course focusing more on what happened this year so my area of specialization is actually philippine u.s security relations so most of my academic works have been focused on our alliance but of course since 2001 you have the china factor coming in you know it coincided of course with the emergence of china and the fact that three philippine administrations since the beginning of 2001 i'm referring to president gloria machado royal has basically taken to account what i would call this triangular relationship so during the time of president arroyo she made this delicate balancing act so uh he basically said that we will have to you know using mao zedong term we have to walk uh walk on two rivers or walk until two legs i'm sorry so then you have president aquino who really cited on the part of the united states now of course this is an unprecedented case with president duterte who basically pivoted to china and adopted what i call an appeasement policy this appeasement policy is of course based on two uh caveats number one you will have chinese public investment and number two there's an expectation that you will have a moderation in chinese behavior in the south china sea of course these two things never happened china have not fulfilled its part of the bargain so i'll focus more on the moderation of chinese behavior in the south china sea and what we see of course since uh the third administration is that you have cases of tensions between the chinese and of course philippine forces deployed in the south china sea i'll give you some cases in april 2009 you have 275 chinese vessels surrounding pagasa island or kitu when of course the armed forces philippines started rehabilitating its dilapidated uh airstrip in that island uh then of course you have the sinking of a pilipino fishing boat in the reed bank in june 2019 where of course the crew members of that fishing boat were left by the chinese fishing vessel that ram their boat of course allegation that it was an operation by the chinese maritime militia then of what what happened last year on february 17 where you have a chinese uh corvette pointing its gun director system against the uh brp conradria the philippine uh uh philippine ship brp conrady up the late the most modern ship in the philippine navy's arsenal and incidentally this happened less than two weeks after president duterte announced the abrogation of the visiting forces agreement and of course the most recent one which i am going to focus is of course the recent winston show or winston reads fan off which lasted of course from march 20 to may uh kind of long similar to what happened of course in 2012 during the scarborough shoal standoff but even before you have this winston uh reef standoff you have of course the philippines filing a diplomatic protest against china when the chinese government passed the coast guard law the philippines is the only age country in asia not even japan that filed a formal diplomatic protest basically of course we're shadowing what would happen in march so let's just give give a very uh brief rundown of that incident of course the incident began on march 20 when defense secretary rosanna announced the presence of 204 chinese fishing vessels stationed at winston shoals stationary and they have been there since december 2020 they're all uh forming a sort of a palace they're all tied together they were not conducting any fishing and of course they're stationary immediately it was assumed by a known government task force that came out publicly the task force on westfield pc which was actually established even during the time of president aquino i was there of course september 2015. uh sorry 2014 that task force was established in the aftermath of the scarborough shoal standoff in 2012. so it came out publicly and basically said we have now a situation that might be akin to what happened on mischief in 1995 and of course scarborough shoal in 2012 you have where you have of course uh chinese gray zone operation being conducted against the philippines immediately if you have of course vigorous reaction from of course secretary of national defense secretary of the department of foreign affairs secretary vaccine who promised to file diplomatic protests against china every day as long as the fishing vessels were there and of course you have the coast guard deploying its coast guard vessels much to the joy of the japanese government because if you remember the japanese government donated about 12 multi-purpose coast guard vessels and they were never deployed by this administration until you had the winston show uh santa much of course the delight in tokyo that finally they're being used in the westfield pc they're being used to guard tourist spots in the philippines but not in the west philippine sea so you have this vigorous action by of course uh the philippine uh the coast guard the navy the department of national defense and of course the department of foreign affairs uh all the time president duterte was nowhere to be seen until around april he came out initially backing the secretary of national defense who engaged the chinese ambassador in manila in a war of words so he said i'm supporting my secretary of national defense eventually of course a few days later he started to get turned against his own secretary of national defense as secretary of foreign affairs first he said uh you know your actions could lead into a major conflict with china this is something very dangerous so it's basically undermining his own two cabinet members then of course the possibility of seeking assistance from the united states was raised by the secretary of national the spokesperson of the department of national defense and even by the department of foreign affairs and of course you have duterte saying no we will not seek assistance from the united states this will trigger it to war so you have a number of his pronouncement that basically went against uh his own cabinet members and basically emphasized the fact that no matter what happened appeasement policy will be the order of the day so uh of course mentally the standoff and dead but what are the two points that i would like to emphasize number one of course you have this increasing tensions between the philippines and china and the south china sea uh winston show uh and of course recently let's mention about that coast guard vessel driving away the chinese warship so this will happen especially as of course the election period is happening and what is also very apparent is the clash what i call the dynamic clash happening within the philippine government you have certain cabinet members say certain agencies who are questioning the appeasement policy of the the turkey administration and of course you have president duterte trying to stick with his appeasement policy i think this is a key challenge for the biden administration or for the united states if it could tip the balance within that philippine within the philippine government uh secretary lloyd austin will be coming here that would help but of course the crucial event that would possibly get the balance will be next year's election so i end my presentation here thank you very much for your attention thank you very much derek if you want to go next thanks yeah and uh good morning or good evening or good afternoon wherever you are it's actually late afternoon here in sunny california just sitting outside on my back porch uh so um yeah i want to kind of pick up where renato left off and since i'm sandwiched in between renato and general stillwell and general stillwell is going to be talking about more the u.s side of things i kind of want to serve as a bridge between talking about china and the philippines on the one hand and the us and the philippines on the other since this is that triangular relationship that we're trying to frame it as and so on the china philippines side i mean it's really just quite striking what's been going on since duterte uh was was elected back in 2016. i mean he literally um wanted to try to diversify the philippines is uh foreign and security policy right and to diversify it away from an over reliance on the united states i mean i think we all know that duterte for decades you know has shown an anti-american stance and more recently perhaps a pro-chinese uh stance in his um in his policies and so one of the first things he did as president was he said uh bye-bye washington and hello beijing uh and there was you know a lot of angst in uh in the beltway about about this move uh and what it meant for the future of the alliance um but you know you fast forward to today and what you've seen is duterte has gotten absolutely nothing from bolstering his ties with beijing and in fact you could i think easily argue it has been severely counterproductive to philip to philippine um foreign insecurity policy and so um now let me give you a few examples so one of the things that duterte talked a lot about was we're going to get money through china's belt and road initiative to build up to to invest in the philippines and build up infrastructure in the philippines and to date very few if any of those projects have really amounted to much now we could we could debate about why that is some say that it's because of um legal uh restrictions in the philippines right but others say well actually china has not done well in terms of providing the requisite funds and bringing its workers there to actually break ground on a lot of these projects so there's some debate about it but regardless duterte's got nothing on bri practically um when you look at the potential for a joint exploration deal between china and the philippines now this is in the disputed uh part of the south china sea uh duterte had said don't worry we're gonna get a joint exploration deal in place with china uh regardless of our sovereignty disputes we'll patrol the waters together uh in order to extract natural resources there hasn't happened and it's not gonna happen it's pretty obvious between now and the end of duterte's tenure uh in june of next year that there's practically no chance of that happening i think we would all be stunned if it did because things have gotten so bad uh per everything renato was just talking about in the south china sea and let's focus um specifically on um you know some of the backtracking frankly that duterte's had to do with the south china sea because you know every morning you wake up and you see his statements i mean on sometimes he'll say we're gonna you know i'm paraphrasing here but we're basically gonna fight to the death against china and the south and the south china sea if it comes to that but then the next morning you wake up and he says something akin to you know what china can just have the south china sea there's nothing we can do about it anyway so why even try i'm paraphrasing but that's essentially the gist of kind of the the pendulum swings here that could literally make you nauseous and i and i think that a lot of that is because um he just doesn't know what to do and he doesn't want to look like he's cozying up to to his decades-long partner in the united states because again he is anti-american he talks all the time about american colonialism back in the early 1900s he talks about scarborough shoal more recently in 2012 when china essentially uh you know annexed scarborough shoal from the philippines and the united states it did not trigger the mutual defense treaty uh and now china de facto control scarborough shoal so duterte will bring that up and say look we can't trust the united states u.s commitment is basically trash to us and so i and and this is this has come up very recently in the last couple of days with the sec def visit with sectof austin going to the philippines um lorenzana the you know defense secretary in the philippines uh talked about how the vfa the visiting forces agreement will remain intact but there will be an addendum to it and now there's kind of a lot of there's like a huge swirl about what's going to be in that addendum i have a feeling it's going to be about scarborough shoal because duterte has has publicly aired that out in the last few weeks saying the united states simply cannot explain to us in any rational terms why they abandoned us at the scarborough shoal so i and i've and i've been very sort of public about this in my writings and and what i and you know what i've said to the media yeah i think duterte at the end of the day has no other choice but to partner with the united states uh uh to offset china's growing military power in the region when he looks at scarborough he doesn't want to have another scarborough happen on his watch uh and so the way to ensure that that doesn't happen is to allow the philippine defense establishment which is overwhelming to continue to to uh engage the u.s military in uh in in joint trainings and in all kinds of other activities procurement of of weapon systems and the like i mean we saw i think the other day that the philippines is going to buy f-16s now we'll see if they can afford them but these types of things i think will rem these trends in the in the u.s uh philippines alliance i think will will uh will continue uh in a positive direction regardless of what duterte's policy is on china now on the u.s side i will just say that it's been very interesting with the visiting forces agreement because as we all know in february 2020 duterte decided to terminate the agreement but luckily there was a 180 day uh waiting period before that could happen and within those 180 days the the philippines um came back in june of last year and postponed termination of the agreement for the first time and then in november 2020 postponed for the second time and then in uh last month postponed for a third time so the vfa looks like it is here to stay perhaps through the remainder of duterte's uh six-year term and i think when you look at some of the language that came out during those uh during those postponements it's very interesting so in june 2020 the language talked about gave two reasons for one the pandemic and there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic so we better you know keep that keep the vfa intact at least for now because it could help us down the road and the second was sort of a generic great power competition not naming china okay then in july of last year for the first time under the duterte during in the duterte administration the philippines uh department of foreign affairs publicly acknowledged the arbitration ruling in 2016 in manila's favor that's something that duterte was always loathed to do but he apparently gave authorization to to uh you know to the department of foreign affairs to do that and then in september of last year when he gave a speech at the united nations general assembly i think it was right before chinese president xi jinping as well uh he said that the arbitration ruling was a fact and could not be overturned and that the philippines was going to go full throttle on supporting that ruling i mean this was really groundbreaking stuff for a man who you know the for four and a half years prior to that had just talked glowingly about beijing and very negat negatively about washington and then in november 2020 during the second postponement of the vfa uh china was specifically named as of deep concern to the philippines and then of course you had the whitson reef saga that renato just very accurately went through over the last few months and so what was interesting is in the last um in the third postponement of the vfa last month um the secretary of foreign affairs teddy lux and junior did not mention china but i think it's pretty clear from conversations that luxon and secretary of state tony blinken have been having as well as secretary of defense austin has been having with um with the defense with defense secretary um uh lorenzana that china really is kind of at the forefront of of both countries minds right now and so i think with secretary austin visiting the philippines as part of a three-country tour uh next week in the region we're going to see a lot of conversation about china come out after that so i think the alliance let me just finish by saying there's a lot of folks out there who say that the alliance is in is in grave condition uh i'm not one of them i actually think that these three postponements essentially prove the point that the philippines doesn't have anybody else to rely upon except the united states and can even weather an anti-american president like duterte because china poses that much of an existential threat to the philippines with that i will turn it over to general stillwall thank you well derek thank you for that and uh renato also uh for laying the groundwork making my job easy i just have to nod and go yep i agree with all those things but uh maybe i can add a little bit of uh granularity to what the thought process was back in the beltway during the the most recent two years and then uh being military i had the good fortune of actually serving in the obama administration in the pentagon as well so i can offer some of the thoughts from 2012 and then 2016 as well so i would note um just to kind of chapeau this whole thing i was at the 2014 shangri-la dialogue and it was the first time we took them on hit you know straight on it was wang guangzhong versus chuck hagel where we both sort of aired grievances and the headlines from the straight times at that time said china for prosperity u.s for security basically saying we don't have to choose we can get the best of both deals just by maintaining positive relationships with both i believe that's been the general attitude from asean and others all along is um if you do choose you and you stand to lose one way or the other i would say you stand to lose much more uh from the chinese side the us doesn't tend to you know toward retribution as much as chinese do but the point is there is this idea of don't make us choose uh prominently from the singapore side you know you hear that a lot um but others also manifest that and so uh you have to ask the question what is the choice that we're asking these folks to make well um if you look at what china's main weapons in all of this is and it's not military i mean you can overwhelm scarborough and they can definitely overwhelm smaller bilateral partners but what they use is economic leverage and that economic leverage is difficult to resist um the u.s offers long-term security guarantees but immediate economic damage from chinese use as we've seen with australia and others uh clearly uh you know philippine exports riding on the docks and other things that has immediate effect and a political effect for uh folks like the philippines and so this is why state department and my bureau uh floated the idea a while back of something of like an econo economic article five where if we boycott australian table wines and or we put 2012 or 212 percent tariff on those wines that the uh rest of the free market world would just accept the buying a little bit more australian wine to offset the loss to uh remove that threat from the chinese side this would be a big benefit to the philippines you know if they could just shift markets away from the prc for a time but to take away this economic cudgel uh that that china has used so well in this prosperity versus security uh construct so that's gonna take some time for that to come to fruition so in the meantime what we did at an eap during that was we took some solid stands um to reverse some of the bad decisions and the bad uh policy uh initiatives out of dc during my time when i was in the obama administration we already met scarborough but then there's the uh tribunal of law in the sea which we did encourage the philippines to do and yet when the tribunal announcement took place we had folks in the past administration to back walk away from it and say let's just turn the page we could be friends china and all the rest leaving our friends in the philippines twisting in the wind as we would say uh these are difficult decisions to bounce back from from manila i'm sure it all looks like something dc would do now i'd ask my friends manila to look at what the trump side did in terms of clarifying and simplifying alliance relationships you know if someone would say it was more transactional uh but that that simplicity and and clarification made it easier um i think to negotiate and maneuver i mean if you use the nato example of how uh trump treated nato and i completely agree that if you sign up to two percent of your gdp uh to deter and to send a strong deterrent message to the primary foe in this case the russians or soviet union if you don't maintain that two percent commitment do we have an alignment do i mean do we have an alliance do we have an agreement i mean there these things are based on um mutual benefit and the same would apply in the trump administration's approach to alliances in asia pacific so what we did uh in that case to sort of regain credibility and then to follow up on a very fortunate outcome from the tribunal was in july of 2020 we changed the policy to reflect that china's maritime claims are completely illegal that's what unkos said and uh and we aligned our policy with that what that did was it gave the philippines full claim of his easy uh all the resources inside cec and then also gave credit to the tribunal ruling that and supported the philippine side hard to erase the back and forth of varying political sides in the u.s over time so again i can sympathize with manila and others um but if you look at actions over the last four years for sure and i think these will continue with secretary austin's trip uh i think we've demonstrated that consistency and policy will make these alliances more difficult on both sides and then we can expect the other side uh to contribute more uh simple things like a vfa and the rest i'll close though with one last thought it's a bilateral treaty right but um security in the region is based on multiple parties when more than one party i mean the philippines versus china is no contest the us in the philippines versus china is a better contest but asean and the us versus prc malfeasance in the region is a you know that's a winning hand so uh would eventually hopefully discuss the uh ability for this trip to vietnam singapore and manila to stitch those together into a single coherent regional approach i'll stop there thank you right thank you very much everybody uh going off of your last comments uh general still i might one of our audience members has asked um maybe for the other panelists to elaborate a little bit more on why there hasn't been a stronger collective response from asean against chinese aggressions in the south china sea and if you think there is room for that to change considering that sort of those aggressions have continued and in fact sort of ramped up so the questions directed to whom yeah if you if you uh want to go ahead and answer yeah sure well one reason is asean is divided since 2012 in cambodia china has effectively divided asean so you have the continental states that are of course aligned with china because of geography and of course their economy then in maritime southeast asia you also have a division between what i call those who are fen sitters and of course countries that have the potential to challenge china i'm talking about of course vietnam indonesia and of course the philippines in the case of the philippines you see that division we have certain sector in the government here who wants to align our policy in competition with cambodia to be china's best friend and of course you have the other side that's challenging china so that's the point that's why asean could not come out with a collective response because when it comes to the south china sea issue it's divided [Music] yeah i think i totally agree i mean i i think there's no way uh in the current state of asean for asean to collectively push back against china for all the reasons that renato outlined and i mean just look at what's going on with myanmar i mean they're they're they they cannot get into an agreement on on myanmar because each of the countries have different interests um uh and you know they have this five-point consensus that has essentially ground to a halt uh and it's not even really that controversial of a consensus basically that one of the main points is that the two parties should continue to speak the top medal you know the military that's now ruling uh myanmar and the civilian government and they can't even really facilitate those types of negotiations and so let alone a deal with china uh and you know i think the code of conduct is the perfect example of this i mean it's been going on for now like 20 years almost uh and there's been no agreement and you know that's because for one thing china tries to tries to kind of divide the different asean members from each other uh on developing a code of conduct in the south china sea and another is china has the preponderance of power uh and can you know take on one or multiple of the asean maritime counter claimants uh militarily if it needed to and they know that and so it's you know it's really hard for asean to figure out a way to deal with china in a cohesive manner okay thank you very much um next question from the audience um i guess again for renato uh who do you think would be the who's the strongest presidential candidate right now that would reverse most of duterte's appeasement policies towards china um or do you think he's going to continue to have influence going forward i know there's been a little bit of discussion about you know he mentioned recently he wanted to potentially run for a vice president or something like that uh i would say the most powerful but basically you have three uh parties that have already indicated their interest and they'll run number one of course is duterte's anointed successor which happened to be his daughter the mayor of davao city which doesn't have that string of anti-americanism compared to his dad for one thing of course her mother is an american citizen the wife of president duterte the former wife and even the current partner are american citizens so that's a funny thing about president duterte is surrounded by american citizens even his daughter is an american citizen who was born in california but for one reason or the other yes is personal so he has this anointed one of course uh her daughter it's supposed to be the strongest right now because of uh you know there's supposed to be an assumption that duterte's popularity could be inherited that of course challenges conventional political science wisdom charisma could not be inherited could not be passed second of course is someone who is right now in las vegas who has been pushed out of the his political party as the president and i'm speaking no less than manny pacquiao so he has already indicated that's why he was absent from the pdp 11 then you're supposed to have the alternative the current um senator la alexi laxon let's say ring a bell the former police chief during the time of president joseph estrada and of course the senate uh president uh uh for big soto then of course you have uh some bayern which snapchat have filled in the political candidate but of course is eyeing to uh to you know uh push a single opposition candidate that will of course challenge victory so it's at this point in time it's really difficult to say who would have the great you know the most chance of winning this election just like an american election you simply don't know what will happen next and for one thing of course we pattern our system from you guys i just said sorry can i just ask renato a question actually on that is it it does sarah duterte share duterte her i guess her father's pro-chinese perspectives on things not necessarily in fact when president duterte abrogated the visiting forces agreement last year sarah duterte was in washington d.c she was on the leadership program of the state department used to be called the international business program and she was recalled back to manila and she was not very happy and she declared you know you know if i'm on the same shoes as my dad i will befriend everyone i will not take side taking a dig at this at her father i i had a quick question i wanted to ask uh dave stillwell and and general stillwell you um briefed a lot of people in your course your career and if you were in the room briefing austin before he went to to visit the philippines what would you have uh advised him what would you have said to him in terms of your experience in dealing with this area um i'm sure you've got a lot of done a lot of reflection on that and and what would you be what would be your two cents to give him that's a really good question and uh there's parts of that answer i would keep behind closed doors um but i would there's a practical aspect to that uh let me just put it this way i would advise him that president trump's response to the vfa abrogation in february 2020 was absolutely the right response when when uh he got wind of that the president said hey you know he's it's a sovereign country they can do what they want dot dot dot besides it will save us money um that was the response i think the response back from manila to that said as i said this relationship has two sides to it it can't be one-sided right and if you expect the u.s to come to your aid into terms of defense we've got to have the ability to operate and we have to have the ability to train and these things all relate to a visiting force agreement edca all the rest of those things that we're talking about so um you don't do these things in public um because that force is bad you know you you've got to look strong to your own people but at the same time you can't let uh personal preferences and this this counter colonialism history and all those things take you away from the realistic the realism of the day the threats of the day so um maybe i would offer an inside and outside voice on that uh so when the doors are closed and have that conversation after offer some real politics here and say what does u.s get from this that'd be probably the number one okay um charles ludlow asks for all three presenters uh china appears uncharacteristically to be pushing an aggressive strategy with prospects for armed conflict in the ses uh it also appears that china is on a timetable of some sort both of these are historically not typical chinese approaches do you think this strategy will backfire in the long term okay i'm unmuted uh let me just answer that quickly uh so we just finished the first centenary the 100-year establishment of the party back in 1921. uh xi jinping when he came to power in 2012 2013 offered a different china a confident positive and as you mentioned timeline china china has things to accomplish um but at the same time china has annoyed us neighbors considerably renato i appreciate your your uh concerns about mekong asean but from where we sat we were able to get a lot of mileage from the five mekong members uh just in terms of abuse of a major water resource and downstream rights and we held a water you know rivers conference and these other things that there was some very vocal participation on the code of conduct negotiations you've seen that you know they've done what asean does best is they've basically obfuscated and slow rolled uh what china went from being let's not get it done right away if you remember in 20 china said let's get this done in the next three months and asean did a very good job with vietnam at the lead uh of slowing that down into something more reasonable so um yeah i uh china can be as aggressive as it wants but it can't take on all five or ten or whatever asean uh countries at the same time nor can it take on the whole world in the pandemic i think is another issue that we eventually need to talk about is what that's done to chinese position in the world suddenly this fuzzy panda idea and the fact that you know the american you know malfeasance is the cause of all evils is no longer resonating so we should all work together to get through the pandemic together renato you mentioned uh you know donations of fire of uh vaccines to the philippines and others both to covax and just straight bilateral transfer while the other side is selling sino farm and sinovax so um yes aggressive possible timetable uh backfire absolutely yeah i mean i think if you look across the indo-pacific chinese assertiveness is not appreciated anywhere um i mean there's just so many i mean there's literally so many examples of it now it's hard to keep up um you know whether you're japan or you're australia uh you're the philippines right taiwan and now high in the himalayas against india i mean the list just goes on and on of of kind of self-made crises um that china's engaged in and i you know will it backfire i tend to think yes but then again a lot of it depends on what we do in the united states if duterte has one important point that i think we all need to take away here it is the scarborough shoal more than anything else because you know we could argue through legal machinations you know why the mutual defense treaty wasn't triggered when china took over scarborough shoal if that helps us sleep at night great all right but it does not it does not help an alliance all right when a country's de facto territory is taken over by another country and we do nothing all right so and it's not just the philippines in my conversations across the region with with interlocutors they always bring up scarborough always how can we possibly trust the us military commitment to the region when that happened just recently and then of course in 2017 we have uh you know president trump deciding to withdraw from the trans-pacific partnership that's another thing now not military but another an another component now the economic component of the us's position and and you know sustainability in the region uh being put into being put into question uh so you know i think we need to kind of do more in the region to show that we care i mean i will tell you one thing with and by the way the buy demonstration is not immune to this i'm not trying to pick on the trump administration but president biden is yet to speak directly on the phone with it with any southeast asian leader zero we're six months in okay now you could say we're dealing with covid we're dealing with economic recovery we're dealing with lots of other things right but to not pick up the phone and talk to at least one southeast asian leader is not i mean it just shows that you're not paying attention to the region enough and so that kind of feeds into the angst and concern that southeast asian countries have and why not remain non-aligned if you can't trust the united states you can't trust china either so just try to get you know maximize your benefit from both and hope that they don't go to war building off of that i think one of our audience members asks is there an alliance dilemma or maybe a perceived alliance dilemma that the us is reluctant to back its friends and allies because it fears being trapped into a conflict with china over small features in the ses i guess that would move me um i don't think so i mean i think in the last administration we came out pretty strong in favor of uh being clear on where the mutual defense treaty does apply and does not apply and i do have they said it twice uh during that time and so they're definitely a commitment there uh i think what he's describing is this idea of a commit trap where uh by committing to you know defend anything that enables the other partner to take action that may not have been advisable or put you in a position you don't want to be in um and i mean that's always a consideration but i think the solution is just constant interaction and conversations uh and i the military conversation is important but you know the military guy here is going to lose all his friends when he says it's the diplomatic relationship that's far more important and i do think from what i could tell that songkim uh and our diplomatic presence and uh conversations both in dc and in manila were very productive uh for my part um i had some uh very and a lot of uh in productive conversations with ambassador ramaldas uh and the embassy there so it's a long way of saying yeah i mean commit trap's an issue but if you're in close coordination i think it's not something you have to think about or worry about okay and then on the other side going for the econ question this was directed to general stillwall but i think it could be opened up to whoever wants to respond do you think it's likely we can uh do you think it's possible rather that we can reconstruct the tpp um and would this at this late point in time uh be helpful in countering china's sort of economic leverage in the region in an ideal world yeah it would be great to get back on that tpp bandwagon but see the problem is first of all tpp doesn't even exist anymore it's now the cptpp all right and second of all um you know bipartisan or excuse me uh the extreme polarization in this country uh politically i think makes it very difficult to get that kind of deal done uh and through the congress and you know it's not just um you know one side or the other it's actually it's both sides the extreme ends of both the democratic and republican parties so because i mean progressives in the democratic party they want to keep american jobs here and they're going to be worried about if the u.s signs up for the cptpp uh assuming we're invited in right um then that might mean that american jobs are going overseas but then the kind of like pro-trump republicans on the conservative side they actually want the same thing because it's america first uh to them so you know i think it would be extremely difficult for uh for us to get back into um now the cptpp jump in uh this is where i believe the quad enters the picture quadrilateral security dialogue and of course especially the role of japan so it's not china that has invested and the duterte administration build build build program it's japan the largest infrastructure projects here in the philippines are all funded by the japanese so this word japan enters the picture especially when you talk about investment and even trade and of course you can bring in also australia into a certain degree south korea the challenge for trade in this in the philippines in particular and southeast asia in general is what is mentioned earlier diversification that we won't have china as our last you know our only customer at the end of the day the uh from the perspective of washington southeast asia is still far away but for japan south korea australia and even india southeast asia is just in their neighborhood this is where i would believe that quad would play a very important role the quad would play a very important role um here is another question for dr decastro can you walk us through the internal government debate that has led to manila's decision to begin talking about the tribunal uh publicly and what do you think the key factors were in uh in having the administration make that big change uh number one of course the piecement deal is based on two canvas which i earlier mentioned china's money would enter and of course you have of course the uh hope that china would moderate their behavior this did not happen the administration went through with this until of course you have uh you have only one person of course that has been opposing the appeasement policy and as of course secretary laureate because he has been there since 2016. it was the military that basically asked president duterte after he came back from beijing in october 2016 what do you mean by separation so president duterte had to make some steps back he said you know separation doesn't mean severing the ties then of course you remember what happened in marawi 2017 where of course the armed forces of philippines realized its limitation in terms of logistics reconnaissance and sure enough of course you have american forces providing a reconstitutes plane and this strengthened basically the pro-american element in the philippine government especially in the armed forces philippines then of course you have secretary luxem becoming the foreign secretary around 2018 2019 he made a lot of difference now you have two key cabinet members who are basically taking the cudgel for the security relationship secretary laurasana and of course secretary luxem so they've been trying to man the port despite president duterte's effort to slowly incrementally unravel the alliance so this is the dynamics going on and of course this dynamics will become more intense as the election period comes closer you'll have a lot of senators you have a lot of you know cabinet members will start questioning president duterte because he's practically right now a lame duck president and of course as election period comes you'll have again a change so again this is the dynamics of any liberal democracy i hope you know i made it clear [Music] okay so going into that security uh relationship a little bit more one of our audience rob knight jr asks do you think the u.s philippine strategic relationship uh can be strengthened with additions to a modified visiting forces agreement treaty one that possibly increases u.s use and partnered upgrades of ports and bases within the philippines and west philippine sea to ensure a better strategic posture against china's grave zone tactics would this step be necessary to hold china accountable for going against international rule of law norms in the region according to the tribunal decision well an agreement like that um and anything you you can do to uh you know jointly state a commitment to this this mutual defense can't hurt i mean it can only help uh to ronaldo's point earlier uh and to derek's point more uh more so uh the japan and and other allies aspect the quad and other things is something that is under um stated as well that that could use a little more emphasis japan is a great silent partner in all of these things in mainland southeast asia in the philippines and other places so again ronaldo thanks for bringing that up that that helps and it's like-minded they're you know a security partner obviously an ally of the u.s as well this is what my old boss general marty dempsey the chairman of the joint chiefs noted that we got to get out of this hub and spoke uh alliance process that we've been talking about and this goes to the question and move toward more of an alliance network we are all focused on the same issue therefore the u.s doesn't have to be the center actor in all of this uh we're all pretty much pulling in the same direction we should take advantage of that and again a philippine japan alignment or or cooperation would be a great outcome that's a message uh in addition to things like visiting forces at and exercises and all the rest all these things matter okay i just i just think the united states is trying to uh hold on to the vfa uh until duterte's gone and then maybe you know maybe we wouldn't have to worry about it anymore uh i you know an upgraded vfa is almost unthinkable at this point i think just keeping it intact is what is is the goal right now and i think that that's that's a respectable goal given the circumstances and you know it post duterte maybe it's possible to bring back um the enhanced defense cooperation agreement the edca um that general stillwell was just talking about and then that would allow the united states to pre-position troops and equipment at five different bases throughout the philippines to deal with uh potential contingencies in uh in the south china sea or elsewhere so but you have to have the vfa first in order to get the the edga you can't what you can't get one without the other because it's very difficult then to get troops in and out of the philippines uh without the vfa so um yeah my two cents uh if i may uh of course at this point in time we look at the alliance in terms of an alliance of necessity you know from perspective the united states we need each other because of the china challenge the long-term challenge of the alliance of course is to transform it from an alliance of necessity to an alliance of choice we have the security partnership because we have long historical ties we have this alliance because we're both liberal democracies we have this alliance and this is something i also emphasized and something i experienced when i studied there in the states for six years we have this very you know long and intense trans-pacific partnership i'm talking about six three two to three million americans who of course trace their heritage here in the philippines i'm talking about the filipino-american community that's something that has not been emphasized in this alliance so every filipino family has an american relative i remember uh when harry thomas was here ambassador harry thomas and he had discussion with the chinese ambassador then chinese ambassador said every filipino has a chinese blood in his banks ambassador harry thomas said every filipino family has an american relative so this is an aspect of the relationship or the alliance that we have not explored into so you know that's my point how can we transform this because the china challenge will be a long-term challenge so this alliance should be made durable by making it an alliance of choice not simply a matter of an alliance of necessity okay i think we've got time for one more question so from yo kikuchi uh asks what kind of implications can we expect from recent movements of uh european states sending naval vessels to the scs and are these seen in a positive light by the philippines um so if you could just answer that can you maybe i'm sorry repeat the question oh yeah um so asking i think talking about um like british and german germany and france sending ships to patrol in the ses um what implications does that have for the philippines and are they seeing it maybe in a positive light or well i'll let renato talk about how the philippines is seeing it but i mean from an american perspective it's got to be very welcomed right i mean because the quad if the quad is really the centerpiece of american foreign policy in the indo-pacific and the buying administration has more or less said that uh you know that is a group of like-minded democratic countries so if you have more like-minded democratic countries coming in to uphold a rules-based international order uh in this case specifically in the south china sea i mean that that can't be a negative thing i don't think from the u.s perspective but i wonder what renato thinks about the philippines uh regarding the visits of the british uh generally it's a pathetic attitude regarding it this the focus is still on u.s japan it's because it hasn't happened yet was just an announcement of britain that will be sending its scarier battle group into the region then britain would be maintaining two uh warships in that area germany would be sending a frigate you know point areas so what will they make a difference maybe too early to tell on that well uh we're coming up on nine o'clock and keeping in mind that all of our participants are calling in from very different time zones i wanted to thank you all again for this great discussion also thank you to all of the audience for their great questions um hopefully we can continue this debate and i'm sure we all have plenty to think about so thanks again everybody thanks thanks everyone take care bye general by uh direct yeah byron auto by general bye okay never mind
3mrUJbMLCgY,U.S. calls South China Sea ruling 'final and legally binding',"남중국해 전운 고조 중 ""영향 안 받아"" 대 미 ""구속력 있다""
The world's two superpowers,... the United States and China are already clashing over an international tribunal's ruling on the South China Sea dispute. 
China refuses to accept it,... but the U.S. says it's final and legally binding... and all related countries should abide by it. 
Kwon Soa starts us off. 

The ruling on the South China Sea dispute is ""final and legally binding"" on both China and the Philippines.
This was the U.S. reaction to the tribunal ruling in The Hague Tuesday,... which brought victory to the Philippines -- which filed the case three years ago -- as well as other Southeast Asian countries involved in increasingly tense maritime disputes with Beijing.
U.S. State Department spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. hopes and expects that China and the Philippines will comply with their obligations.
He called for all parties to refrain from provocative statements or actions,... expressing hope that the ruling will be an opportunity to deal with disputes in a peaceful manner from hereon. 
Kirby said the U.S. has persistent concerns about China's militarization of the South China Sea.



""We have seen some signs in recent weeks that some of that activity continues and we have been again very consistent, very clear with our Chinese counterparts about our ongoing concerns in that regard.""

Those concerns may linger though,... and even grow into bigger diplomatic rows,... as China, which did not attend Tuesday's tribunal,... immediately repeated its stance that it won't comply with the ruling. 
The Chinese government released a statement saying China was the first to ""discover, name, explore and exploit the South China Sea islands and their surrounding waters.""
According to the UN tribunal ruling,... China has no historic or economic legal basis for its expansive claim over around 90 percent of the South China Sea.
South Korea's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday it's taking notice of the ruling and hopes that through this momentum the South China Sea dispute will be settled through peaceful and creative diplomatic efforts.

5fMqkucJc38,"U.S. admiral says freedom of navigation operations aren't a threat

U.S. Pacific Command, South China","Tensions between the United States and China are on the rise，... with both countries imposing their presence over waters near artificial islands built by China in the South China Sea 
The U.S. says it has a right to be in the area， and doesn′t recognize China′s claim of sovereignty.
Neither side seems ready to back down.
Connie Kim reports. 
A top U.S. defense official says freedom of navigation operations by the United States should not be viewed as a threat to any nation，... after the U.S. challenged China′s claims to artificial islands it is building in the South China Sea.
U.S. Pacific Command commander Admiral Harry Harris said Tuesday during a trip to China，... Washington has been ″conducting freedom of navigation operations all over the world for decades， so no one should be surprised by them.″
He also reiterated that the U.S. ″takes no position on competing sovereignty claims to land features″ in the area.
Underscoring the U.S. assertion， a U.S. defense official had said Tuesday the U.S. Navy plans to conduct patrols within the 12－nautical－mile limit about ″twice a quarter.″
Tensions between Washington and Beijing... escalated last week， after an American destroyer sailed within 12－nautical miles， or 20 kilometers， of the man－made islands China claims.
Twelve nautical miles around a territory is internationally recognized as sovereign territory， but the U.S. does not recognize China′s claim to artificial islands in the area. 
The Spratlys are a disputed group of more than 750 reefs， islets， atolls， cays and islands claimed by China and four other countries， including Vietnam and the Philippines. 
Beijing has so far held firm on its stance， saying it will ″never allow any country″ to violate its territorial waters and airspace in the area.
In a meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on Monday， Chinese President Xi Jinping said the two countries should deal with the issue from a strategic position， seen as indirect pressure on Washington to back down.
In an apparent response to the U.S. challenge， China′s Navy reportedly sent fighter jets over the Spratlys on Friday after the U.S. sail－by.
Retired Chinese General Xu Guangyu noted that it is the ″minimum level of response China should have″ or it will fall short of public expectations.

dKaHxg_6634,Philippine coast guard confronts Chinese maritime ‘militia’ vessels in South China Sea,"Subscribe to our YouTube channel for free here: 
https://sc.mp/clipssubscribe

The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on May 12, 2021, reported ""illegal incursions"" by 287 Chinese vessels in waters claimed by Manila. The footage shows the PCG driving away vessels scattered in a part of the South China Sea that the Philippines claims as the West Philippine Sea. The PCG ordered the Chinese ‘militia’ boats off waters it said were part of the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. China denies using fishing boat crews as militia. While Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has voiced support for improving relations between Manila and Beijing, his foreign ministry has repeatedly lodged complaints about the alleged incursions in recent weeks, and the country's task force on the South China Sea said in a statement that the latest incident may result in diplomatic action.

dPQC--RnM5k,U.S. Navy Admiral Hails China’s Professionalism in Disputed Seas,"Peering over the deck of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier sailing through a disputed part of the South China Sea, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral George Wikoff said he’s been impressed with the professionalism of China’s navy.

“They remain respectful in accordance with what we anticipate a professional would do, and we respond or initiate in kind when we believe that there is a situation,” said Wikoff aboard the USS Ronald Reagan on Wednesday, after taking over command of Task Force 70 two weeks ago. “It has been very cordial, and I think they have been very professional is really what I’d like to emphasize on both sides.“

Sailing within waters China claims in its so-called “nine-dash line” off the coast of Malaysia, the $4.5 billion supercarrier was accompanied by one destroyer and two cruisers. It was headed for Singapore as part of freedom of navigation exercises meant to counter China’s growing military presence in the region at a time when both countries are embroiled in a global trade war.

China’s increasing assertiveness in huge swathes of the sea has put fellow claimants like Vietnam on edge in recent months. Beijing says its naval expansion in the area is designed to safeguard an “inalienable” part of its territory, a push that has prompted the U.S. to warn “China is gaining effective control of the South China Sea.”

The U.S. has challenged China’s territorial claims with regular freedom of navigation missions since 2015. The most recent came last month when a guided-missile destroyer, the USS Wayne E. Meyer, passed near the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan.

U.S. forces are also contending with China’s rapidly growing arsenal of anti-ballistic missiles and unmanned aircraft, part of what the Pentagon has termed “anti-access/area denial” weapons. Among those showcased during a military parade in Beijing this month include the include DF-17 ballistic missiles believed capable of circumventing U.S. defense systems. A supersonic reconnaissance drone, the DR-8, is designed to defeat air and missile defenses.

Still, Wikoff said he has “no concerns” about the security of U.S. forces operating in contested waters. “I slept very well last night, I slept very well the night before and I’ll sleep very well as we transit back through the South China Sea.”

The Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group’s maneuvers have captured China’s attention. China’s Ministry of Defense criticized the U.S. for “flexing its muscles in the region” after the ships participated in war exercises this month, according to a report in the China Daily.

While the admiral wouldn’t talk about the specifics of the carrier group’s mission in the South China Sea, he didn’t deny reports that the aircraft carrier was at one point tailed by several Chinese warships.

“We’re never surprised, ever, so make that very clear,” Wikoff said. Still, he noted the mission of the USS Ronald Reagan remains “to be lethal and ready when the bell rings and the call comes to do so.”

eBfUqNFaHIU,U.S.-China Maritime Conflict and Dispute Management in the South China Sea,"Tensions between the United States and China regarding the South China Sea are rising along with the recent broader breakdown of bilateral relations. The legitimacy of historical rights claims, entitlements and rights of other claimant states such as the Philippines and Vietnam, and the boundaries of freedom of navigation operations are among the central issues. Despite their differences, both the United States and China wish to avoid conflict and uphold professionalism at sea.

Is there any significant space for cooperation in South China Sea interactions beyond military engagement, including biodiversity protection and Coast Guard activities? What role do maritime and international law play in the rapidly evolving bilateral relationship? How is China likely to respond to the upcoming U.S. election in its maneuvers in the South China Sea?

On October 20, 2020, the National Committee hosted a virtual program featuring Peter Dutton, M. Taylor Fravel, Tabitha Mallory, Wu Shicun, and Zhu Feng. The five experts discussed the challenging bilateral issues, and provided their assessments of South China Sea development including maritime engagement of China and other claimants and its impact on South China Sea development, mechanisms for U.S.-China maritime military conflict management, and the role of the United States and China in rulemaking and building security protocols.",0,[Music] let me just say good morning to those in the united states especially tabitha who is up very early and good evening to those in china especially appreciate president wu and zhu fung joining us so late in the evening and it will be even later by the time by the time we conclude this program is the first one that we're doing on this important issue of u.s china maritime conflict and dispute management in the south china sea uh all of you see in the newspapers these days the waters of the south china sea have become a flash point for the intensifying u.s china rivalry raising concerns about the potential for a military clash we've got five outstanding panelists with us today all of whom are good friends of mine and all of whom participate in attract two dialogue which we've been running for many years with the south china seas institute which even in this difficult environment shows that experts in the area can find a way even in this difficult political environment to talk rationally about constructive ways we can try and resolve uh these issues in the south china sea i don't want to spend time going over the bios of everybody because we've got a ton to talk about so let me just give one sentence introductions of where they are and then and then kick off the discussion uh wushu trin as i think everybody on this call knows is president of the china's national institute for south china seas studies uh taylor fravil is the arthur and ruth sloan professor of political science and director of the security studies program at the massachusetts massachusetts institute of technology tabitha thank you tabitha for getting up so early tabitha grace mallory is founder and ceo of the china ocean institute an affiliate professor at the university of washington's henry jackson school of international studies zhu fung is the executive director of the china center for collaborative studies of the south china sea and director of the institute of international relations at nanjing university and peter dutton is a professor at the strategic and operational research department at the u.s naval war college so let's kick it off with president wu each of the speakers will speak for you know five minutes more or less i think because we only have two chinese we have three americans we'll give president wu uh and zhu fang an extra minute or two uh to go on so that it will be equal amongst between the two sides but looking forward to your comments we've already gotten some wonderful questions for our audience not only is the panel very distinguished but the attendees is also a very sophisticated group of uh listeners and watchers so president wu it's wonderful to see you again i'm sorry i can't visit you in in sanya or in high co um i miss the good weather the company and and the good food but let me turn it over to you first okay thank you steven uh thank you for inviting me to participate in this wonderful dialogue with my american courts on the substance issue uh well in my presentation i'm going to look at the two issues the first is about the current self-service situation the second is about on how to manage a conflict between china and united states in south china sea about the current certainty situation i would say compared with the past there are some new volunteer and worrisome developments in the south china sea this year first economies in this region have been hit by 2019 to different degrees governments have shifted their attention from maritime cooperation and negotiations on the coc in the south china sea to economic recovery and the job of creation second the comprehensive deterioration of china-u.s relations has made those two countries more confrontational on the substance issue which can be seen in their totally opposite databricks and actions in the political diplomatic and the military fields if we look at the not conducted with by united states it's too far this year it was eight times and also the settlement of the u.s south china sea policy made by state secretary michael pompeo i think that it could be viewed as a turning point of the u.s southerners policy it means that the neutrality of the southeastern policy is no longer of the u.s policy the third climate states have taken unilateral attitudes one after another such as aggressive demonstration of stubborn oil and gas development in disciplinary areas and diplomatic statements to reinforce unilateral actions for instance the automatic experiments made by multiple countries so far uh altogether 40 24 24 diplomatic diplomatic notes delivered to the united nations by countries including china and the five members states of arsene united states australia britain france and germany and also the drying forces behind those unilateral axis from my perspective are as follows china's growing capability of upholding its rights in south china sea is the primary triggering fact leading to the increasing sense of insecurity among other permanent states the narrow window for the civilizations the u.s abandoning of its neutral policy towards the stock tennessee and the negative impact of such energy arbitration learning first the crisis management mechanism between china united states may fail and the expanding grey zone may increase the risks of china-u.s conflicts in the south china sea there's a great zoo i mean there are no coast guards law enforcement activities maritime malaysia even iu fishing activities first it has become uncertain whether the fields in negotiations will be concluded on time because it is supposed to have four booking groups meetings and the two senior official meetings this year because the question 19 and so far nothing happened so it is uncertain where the cnc will be concluded the second reading of the clc text by end of this year outside the extra regional countries to keep intervening in the stock chain cfs without distracted by the stability in the future so the law of the coc in many maintaining stability and managing processing structures will be questionable so when it comes to the practice and the trends effectiveness china sea in the future the u.s presidential election will have an impact on u.s policy on the south china sea uh if the jail burden is elected the u.s policy will be different at least the military operations such as freedom navigation will not be completed decided by the military without any strength by the u.s administration for some current states the malaysia government has a weaponry position vietnam is going to have a new leadership after the 30th national conference of the communist party of vietnam at the first quarter of next year another philippines will have a new president after election in 20 country too so new leaders in these countries are expected to make an issue of the south china sea in order to consolidate their business for leadership it is expected that the still signification will not be smooth spreading the u.s fact the interference of arbitration disease the less willingness and defense of urgency among other permanent states to reach consensus with china may delay the things in negotiation process the united states japan india and australia are strengthening their core corporation and expanding their security cooperation in the south china sea so this will miniaturize greater power competition in the state of china sea and more urgent to build a multilateral crisis management mechanism crucial cooperation between the united states and taiwan and determines southbound policy may make thailand a liability for chinese men and young behold its rights in the south china sea as the united states has i just mentioned adjust this policy towards the south china and the president duterte of the philippines is approaching the end of his turn the arbitration ruling will be revived again and become a factor to undermine the stability in stock tennessee so in short in my opinion the south china sea will undergo a new round of volatility in the next three to five years a period which is more unpredictable precurious destructive and military oriented second my personal suggestions on managing conflicts between china and united states in the south china sea given that all along the confrontation between china united states official dialogues including meal to meal have come to the heart lack of mutual trust has weakened the binding force of existing criticism management and magnesiums let me give you an example the abstinence you know uh was happening in september 13th 2018 between the two destroyers of united states and china it means that in some special times special occasion the existing crisis and management that the kitchen united states may not be workable and also the grey zone is expanding with no consensus no mechanism and knowledge fishing the risks for comforts and afflictions caused by misunderstanding and misjudgment are higher than any time before so in this context i would like to put on board the whole suggestions first the united states should abide by its commitment to keep it neutral on the south tennessee question rather than just holding no position on territory sovereignty of islands and rifts give the background and the causes of structures issue claims to ireland and the roofs shall not be separated from those two mental waters support for one country's claims to maritime waters in fact means support for its claim to islands and rivers therefore it is not available for the united states to hold no position on sovereignty of ireland and rivers support for one country's military plan in fact is actually taking side second my second station the united states should cover its military operations in south china sea in order to reduce risks of military coverage with child there for example the united states should exercise this restraint president we need to you need to wrap wrap it the up of freedom medication cruising uh reconnaissance military exercise and building military bases around the south china sea in response what china should do china shouldn't deploy a effective weapons in its islands and rich and not announce the establishment of i adip over the south china sea third the two countries should establish a myotonio dialogue at the commander level and recovering mandatory operation instruction c and discuss the establishment of full coverage of its personal management in the stochastic particularly on the application of the code of code of unplanned encounters i see a prior to the coast guard of the course force the united states should still price before it introduces a court called the security competition into the south china sea which the united states shouldn't make the use of terror instruction secretion to undercut the chinese rights and the interesting psychology because this will increase tensions across the titan speech and make the situation in the substance involve compress due to the confrontation uh of course the chemistries so i'm gonna stop there thank you for attending okay there's a lot if if some of the us i mean i can start responding to some of this but i i will go on to the next uh taylor who's next but i think if the u.s um speakers can start to respond some of the the aspects i'll be happy to do it when everybody's finished speaking but there's some things in there which are rather in my view controversial uh taylor great um thanks to the national committee uh for having me and thanks to our colleagues uh from china uh for joining us and evening their time so in my five minutes i wanted to make just a few points i think some of them which we'll be reflecting on sort of the current situation in the south china sea may overlap with a little bit of what was just said um but i'll try to put an american spin on it or an american perspective so my first point right is is that we need to take a step back and and just reflect on a context in which we are now uh thinking about uh the south china sea and its future right which is the really significant decline in u.s china relations over the past few years but which has really accelerated uh in uh 2020. so uh according to pew research right the percentage of americans who view china negatively has increased from 47 percent to 78 in the last five years right so the the this is a pretty grim situation in some respects when trying to think about managing a complex issue by the south china sea now the good news perhaps is that the south china sea has not necessarily been the most prominent issue in certainly american perceptions of u.s china relations these include trade technology xinjiang taiwan hong kong et cetera et cetera but i think there's bad news here which does have implications for how the south china sea can be managed i think there's going to be uh sort of a perceptions of of higher a domestic cost to be paid for cooperative actions or even confidence building measures or stability management measures and there's also sort of within the united states perhaps uh given the overall uh sort of low state of the relationship with china but also i think they'll be perhaps perceived a reputational cost for for for doing so as well and so i think the imperative here given given the way in which the overall relationship is declining is to focus on what at a base sort of a bare minimum level would be kind of the shared interests or the common interests of the us and china and the other claimants in the south china sea upon which some basis of stability uh can be maintained uh for the coming period which as uh dr wu mentioned is volatile so my second point is that i think uh from a u.s perspective right the disputes in the south china sea have sort of transformed or been transformed from a more narrow sort of contest over sovereignty and jurisdictional claims to a much wider issue involving status and hegemony in southeast asia and this goes back to some of the actions that certainly attract a lot of american attention most notably the island building in 2014 and 15 and the power projection facilities that china was able to build out as a result and then more recently actions that are challenging the hydrocarbon activities of littoral states within their coastal eez not with any easies that they might claim from any of the disputed islands but actually easies that they claim from their coast and in these areas of course it sort of overlaps with china's nine-dash line which raises real questions about the legal basis uh for china's actions here which appear to be historic right but have not necessarily been fully articulated by china and so in the last few years we've seen chinese harassment of of drilling operations and uh chinese surveys within the eezs of vietnam and malaysia for this reason of course asean has took a particularly strong stand this summer in some of its joint statements underscoring uh the importance of the u.n convention on the law of the sea as a way of kind of challenging um this idea of historic rights and then we're generally from us perspective of course some of the language that china included into the first negotiating text for the coc i think raised some alarm bells specifically right china included language that was designed uh to include the signatories where asean and china from conducting military exercises with quote countries from outside the region this sort of appeared to be sort of deliberately designed to exclude the united states thus kind of transforming uh the more narrow disputes into something to sort of a broader set of questions about uh southeast asia more generally thirdly uh turning to u.s policy um as uh dr wu mentioned right uh continuation of the freedom of navigation program eight so far this year after eight were conducted in 2019 and this has sort of been a hallmark of i think the trump administration's approach although i think year and year they appear to be increasing a little bit in frequency and then as was mentioned right the emphasis and elaboration of u.s support for the tribunal and its 2016 ruling in the july statement made by mike pompeo um now i this didn't substantially alter the us sort of position on the ruling which was articulated back in 2016 by the state department but it was much more public and much more vivid uh and of course was framed around uh the language of deteriorating u.s china relations i do want to interject here quite sort of quite briefly just to flag it for later i don't believe this statement on maritime claims represents a change in u.s sort of position or the u.s position regarding neutrality in the south china sea which focuses on claims to land features and i don't think uh neutrality links land features and maritime claims largely because the maritime claims uh by the other states especially vietnam and malaysia are not based upon disputed islands but in fact based upon their coastlines right um other elements of u.s policy that are new uh sanctions announced in august on state on enterprise linked entities that were involved in land reclamation about five years ago in this sense these two u.s policies in some ways are retrospective i think that they could be interpreted as a reaction uh both the land reclamation and to the to to the typical not necessarily our current events but what is new uh um in particular i think is the fact that u.s uh naval vessels have been showing up more frequently uh within the the easies of vietnam and malaysia particularly when hydrocarbon activity uh hydrocarbon exploration activity is occurring and so in may you had a u.s littoral combat ship near the west capella which was a rig in malaysia's easy and then earlier this fall or sorry back in july the united states also uh was present in a vietnam easy when china was conducting a survey there so i think that takes me over five minutes i had one more point but i'll save that for uh the q a back to you steve great yeah and that deals with some of uh president wu's issues that he's raised ah tabitha yeah so likewise thank you for having me thanks to the national committee and to my fellow fellow panelists um i'm gonna talk about the marine living resources because these are both a basis for conflict in the south china sea and are also an issue that many hope have has the potential to bring people together and so in preparing these remarks kind of like taylor i was thinking about you know what's what's a bare minimum area of cooperation and also trying to think of something optimistic to say about these issues and so you know can we identify some areas in which the u.s and china have common interests and i noted that both countries share in common a criticism of each other's environmental policies so yesterday the chinese ministry of foreign affairs issued a fact sheet detailing environmental damage caused by the united states which is in response to a similar fact sheet that was issued by the us state department about a month ago on china's environmental abuses and i would say that both sides are largely correct in their assessments and so this brings me to the question of you know what what should a country do when its leadership is being you know maybe just merely rhetorical or even on the opposite end of the spectrum hypocritical on some of these important issues and so one thing i was thinking of is that this is not the only solution but i think one important important contribution is to turn to thinking about positive things that we can do outside the government while we are awaiting leadership that is more conducive to making progress because i don't know that at the government level there is much potential for that at the moment but i do think that we can make plans for when the moment is right and in the area of marine environment and fisheries management i am more optimistic for example i was on a call last week with the chinese fishery scientist who pointed out that china lacks robust communication channels between its scientific research community on the one hand and the policy community on the other hand in china and so that's a really important issue when you're thinking about the best practices for managing you know these environmental resources and it's an area in which the academic and think-tank communities can be of some use this is also an area where the u.s could make some progress we don't do this perfectly either so it's you know it's an area where we can have more discussion and dialogue and then even in areas where the government is taking the lead uh so you know for example both the u.s and china have recognized the need to better address illegal unreported and unregulated or iu fishing and you know so can we think about making some progress on how to handle cases of iu fishing perhaps progress on developing the technology that we need for monitoring and surveillance of coastal waters more progress on identifying points of contact and protocols for handling this and you know to kind of you know get back to dr wu's point about thinking about the mechanisms that we have in place to manage conflicts and you know i think this is thinking about fisheries management is one of them but more broadly you know the mill to mill dialogue cues you know i think it's important to think about you know how are these existing mechanisms possibly failing us in which ways could they be improved and i think we can have that same kind of thinking for managing the living resources too and so that brings me to the next question which is what is the next smallest thing that can be done on managing marine living resources and i'll say at the outset that this is complicated because there's no one solution for all species and all areas of the south china sea and you need separate solutions for species like tuna and squid versus species that are harvested through bottom trawling there is an existing regional fisheries management organization or an rfmo for tuna this is the western and central pacific fisheries commission so that legally covers the south china sea but doesn't do so in practice and then a species like squid is not regulated at all at the international level but if you're thinking about a management solution for fisheries as a way to switch the paradigm on thinking about sovereignty issues as this has you know this has been brought up before so these are ideas in these post-sovereignty or meta-sovereignty ideas like a peace park or some kind of international marine protected area you need not just an rfmo but an area-based management solution because an rfmo just manages the resources while an area-based management solution is tied to a geographical area so it's it's kind of one way you could sidestep a sovereignty issue over a given feature but of course a solution like this will not solve the maritime boundary disputes between the nine dash line that china claims in the easies of the other claimant states and you know taylor was talking about some of the harassment that's been going on on the part of the chinese for the hydrocarbon facilities in the eas of the claimant the other claimant states and this also goes on with the fisheries of course uh so you know trawlers that are in indonesians indonesian easy will have coast guard uh accompaniment in other countries as well um and so those still remain to be resolved but if countries were to implement some kind of multilateral arrangement on a limited scale in you know in a limited area in the south china sea as an experiment this might possibly illuminate some next steps ways to handle other issues there's also a difference between industrial fishing and the artisanal or subsistence level fishing that goes on in the coastal areas the industrial fleet receives huge subsidies that's an issue that that needs to be resolved and so next year the chinese are hosting the meeting on the convention on biological diversity and i could see that as an occasion to develop an idea like this and to make some progress and meanwhile we as the united states can hope that the u.s will ratify the cbd in the first place along with some other notable international conventions dealing with maritime issues i'm done thanks great tabitha thanks thank you thanks for staying within your time we've got some great questions we want to discuss uh zhu fung thank you steve so thanks all of you invite me and join such a great panel i would like to share a couple of my observations particularly against this year i think the south china sea issue has never been more stummy and even provocative to our bilateral relations the reason is very simple first is i think the south china sea conflict actually has a very very badly overtaken the taiwan straight issue you know when we look at the china u.s disputes of the taiwan issue then at least we have had some sort of always say when china uh policy consensus yes uh trump administration really blur the line in the chinese eye on how to just abide by it when china about principle or when china policy but the problem is the taiwan strait is too much close to the chinese coast then they will receive central frequency and even just the house say potential uh we say risk of accidental uh encountering in air and at sea in taiwan straight has just approved to be much lower than mila south china sea but what's the south china sea full of americans navy the south china sea mostly is uh international water it's very very significant so we say maritime credo so then well we'll see yes probably superficially the taiwan issue probably is more embarrassing but actually for the two uh navals posture in the western pacific then we will have to say the south china sea also proved to be the more significant and the more you know the eye-catching for the both people and the region as well then another factor is also very simple i see the washington debating really has a very extremely different interpretation of what's like coronavirus you know geostrategic implications in the eyes of our you know american strategic community then they see you see the uh pandemic is some sort of where's a unique chance to shift to the balance for power probably in china's favor so then and even some politician uh also mentioned the pandemic is uh sir the world war launched by chinese without just firing uh any shots so then and i see there is some sort of strategic anxiety in america's uh critical and a strategic community so there's no way you guys could allow the pandemic where we open some sort of a window of opportunity for china to just the house i shortened some sort of uh power disparity between the two countries so such a uh anxiety also turning into some sort of always say uh great military presence by the americans navy since the uh early march then they will see americans military presence and and the warship and the naval ship worship and airplanes you know the patrolling in south china sea almost a double from uh then the last year's you know the the presence in term of it's a scale and it's where say uh frequency so then such as things really just have say uh very alarmingly uh remind us you have both sides really just trying to move in some some more assertive way to show they have just the house they um insurmountable to uh stick away their uh claim in south china sea then we will see uh south china sea proved to be has never been more uh potentially dangerous in terms of some sort of such uh escalating possibility of in accidental you know encountering and even clips uh uh uh just like how say some sort of way say uh bumping at the sea and a young air then we also know back to 2001 the two uh military jet miniature planes also just did a very tragic you know mid-air collision then in a course the dash of chinese pilots and emergency landing of american surveillance plan yes this year some sort of such accent accidental encountering happened and a cause le shade of black that will be some sort of in my turn is low the kill for some sort of uh very very bad you know deterioration of our relations then i think probably some sort of such a blush a will become last year to to very tragically and disastrously just smashed over bilateral relations then third one i have to say yes if the ussc pandemic is some sort of a possibly a window of opportunity for china to just have regain some sort of a favorable uh balance of power shift but in the eyes of a chinese we're also less sensible to some sort of uniqueness of a pandemic season in the region then the beijing also can't wait longer to just launch the chinese uh coast guard ship to just have a safeguard or china's clean in some sort of such another uh long friend area then yeah of course cause uh some sort of let's say uh complaints and even we say criticism from the neighboring countries but from the beijing's perspective we also see there's no way we can condone america's assertive you know military presence in the south china sea then we will see even politically where is the difference and a very very uh stanley you know the contrasting you know the interpretation on what's in the substance c mean in each you know policy weighing then some sort of a potential of a collision is also surging then my conclusion is this given some sort of disastrous deterioration of our relations then where we see the mood on either side is also getting more volatile and that probably is just very aggressive so then i see a lot of complaints from chinese side then i also read a lot of complaints from american side particularly when the trump just completely repeated his term china violence and holding the china accountable then we will see also such as some sort of going a little bit further such a overturned you know political mood probably will accusate some sort of way say such a less vigilance in their behavior yes both mercury have the two memos then such a two member also settle line for the either side to keep the safe distance when they encounter both in air and at sea but given some sort of such a significantly tending sound mood what worries me so much is this then if the either side just feel less you know completely restrained in their behavior then any incidental encountering and the collision also will cause the black shade then you hear that environment yeah it will be very very disastrous for our relations okay so last one yeah steve is six years there almost there is a suspension of all level of military contacts yeah it'll also become a very very timely remind so maybe the whale maritime management and subchancy needed to bring back the mill mill contacts thank you okay great drew funk thank you very raised a lot of questions which hopefully we'll get to in the q a let me turn it over to peter thanks very much steve um i'm i'm going to offer a word of pessimism a word of optimism and a word of caution um so i'll start with the word of uh of pessimism um look uh assistant secretary of state stillwell said china is engaged in a campaign to impose an order of might makes right in the south china sea and to replace uh international law there it's hard to disagree with that this is the word of pessimism um we can talk about the details of international law and the way china's approach undermines the global stability of international law and we can also talk about china's coercion power-based coercive actions in the south tennessee uh which in the end uh end up holding hostage the the interests of of the uh other coastal states in the region and frankly becomes the the driver of a lot of the dynamics in the south tennessee um the chinese side has to realize that that a lot of its behavior is part of the problem uh in the south china sea it's not just everyone else it's also uh and significantly china's uh behavior in the south tennessee the word of optimism uh has to do with some encouraging dynamics increasingly over over the last decade or so uh there's been there's been a increasing move by other claimants in the south china sea to to use international law and to use international institutions um to to institutionalize their disputes right this is a i think a very productive movement towards you know the 20th and 21st century where we've you know we we recognize that that power based outcomes um are are fundamentally destructive and uh destabilizing to the international uh to the international regime uh you know since 2009 um vietnam and malaysia have used the commission on the limits of the continental shelf to make clear their approach to the south china sea based on international law the philippine arbitration reinforced many of these same uh issues and since 2019 uh malaysia has re-re-energized its approach to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf um resulting in this really important crescendo of international support for international law and use of institutions in the south china sea to resolve those disputes and so i come to the word of caution and here i would actually like to address the very first question in the q a um because um the word of caution has to do with uh with undermining the the globally stabilizing regime that the united nations convention on the law of the sea has has brought us um you might legitimately fault the united states for failing to to join uh the united nations convention on the law of the sea but at least you can't fault the united states for fully supporting its ins it's its approach to international rights and freedoms in the maritime domain right this is a really important a really important point and so the very first question actually in the in the in the q a q has has basically asked well isn't the isn't uh china's approach to the south china sea really no different from the american monroe doctrine in the 1890s and early 1900s uh and my response to that is um well let's even assume it's true i mean it's a debatable point but let's see let's assume it's true hasn't haven't um human affairs come a long way in the last century and a quarter haven't uh two world wars and a in a nuclear-armed cold war taught us that power-based outcomes are not that the power-based outcomes are fundamentally destructive and destabilizing and shouldn't we all be reinforcing international regimes that have brought clarity and stability to to international rights and and obligations in the maritime domain um i think it's important to recognize for all states to recognize uh that that that china has has interest in the south china sea but so do the other coastal states and law makes clear what they are additionally other states have interest in the south china sea the united states uk france germany and many others australia india etc have all made clear that this is a zone in which the international community has very important interests as well so uh so my response to the to the very first questioner is um i i would hope we can all agree that human history has come a very long way since the power dynamics of the 1890s and early 1900s that left us all in in the shambles of the first half of the 20th century and i'm hoping that the 21st century doesn't repeat that process terrific peter in fact look you laid a perfect foundation for my first question which is based on on woosha trends uh kind of presentation the and what taylor said the the um pompeo's speech with respect to the south china sea and assistant secretary stillwell's follow-up um and then subsequent policies really didn't change the foundation of u.s policy in the south china sea that there is and the idea that in a biden administration we're going to see a change in that policy i would not if i were sitting in your chair think that is the case there is virtually universal recognition in the u.s think tank community government and academia that china is acting in violation of international law and the pushback is going to continue whether we have a president trump or whether we have a president biden the sanctions the only thing you know the sanctions as taylor pointed out the sanctions that are being placed on soes that did the dredging in the south china sea is a new policy uh increasing u.s military presence in the south china sea is really just a marginal change that that with that fundamental policy is there so my question for president wu and then for the americans to to comment on are you suggesting we should have a new grand bargain that kind of the two sides should sit down and just come up with a new way to think about the south china sea is that what your various your points were aimed at suggesting i think so both china and the united states should sit down to discuss the south china sea both in the chapter one level and even track two level but now in this administration i mean the trump administration i don't think it is the right time because so far our chapter 1 dialogue magnus noun no all stop or cancel so uh i just mentioned u.s next policy from neutrality uh in 19 from my perspective 1995 one mischief accident was happening before that time u.s you know hosts new usual stands of south china sea and from that time you has adjusted structural policy from neutrality to limited intervention since 2010 when hillary clinton attended the asian foreign minister meetings announced the u.s policy u.s new position towards substances that since that time u.s south china sea policy adjusted from limited intervention to acting intervention so pompeo settlement is the time that the united states is taking sides to support whoever who would like to confront with with china on saturn's issue so i don't think it's possible right now [Music] to talk about the south transition between the china united states but it's necessary even it's auditory to to talk about the substance issue on how to avoid the potential comfort in the southern sea avoid the possibility of a fire off of the military confrontation peter did you want to add something on that yeah sure um thanks steve so i mean i want to make it abundantly clear the us has never been neutral about the application of international law to maritime rights and interests in the south china sea um and the united states has never been neutral about uh its approach to uh condemnation of power-based dynamics in the in in the way that um china and the other uh southeast asians resolve their disputes um and so that's the first thing second i want to remind our panelists and listeners that it was under um the obama administration the first uh obama administration that the entire policy of pushing back uh in the south china sea became uh became sort of heightened as a as a policy approach so i don't think we're going to see any major change in u.s policy even if we have a change in administrations um the third quick point to make is that i i do agree with wu shutsun in the sense that um going forward after after the politics settles down from whatever happens in this election um uh it will be time for a fresh conversation between the us and china about managing um the militarization of the south china sea and managing the disputes in the south china sea um and i but i think either side uh republican or democrat will approach it in roughly the same way i agree with that uh h song asks a question he's also a member of the track two uh dialogue that we have on these issues uh china declares making the south china sea into a sea of peace friendship and cooperation asean proposes to make the south china sea as sea of peace stability and prosperity um they both agree to maintain peace and stability in the south china sea what about the united states is it possible for the united states government to make a peace and cooperation proposal which maybe gets to exactly what peter was suggesting that when things settle down after the election we should move in that direction peter tabitha or taylor you want to answer that i'll let i'll let one of my colleagues know um mike i can jump in i mean i think i think you know going back to the the the initial statement the obama administration i think you know maintaining peace in the south china sea was an important part of u.s policy right and so um one could make an another declaratory statement to that effect they both sound good what china says and what asean says but of course the real question is how do you put that into practice and what does it what are the details right um and the trends seem to be uh moving in in the opposite direction i do think for example going back to some of the issues raised earlier right we we do have uh mechanisms in place at least from a u.s china perspective like the mmca and the mous that can be used as a basis for conversation because these were primarily designed to prevent incidents that would then uh you know lead to potential miscalculation or escalation and so um certainly i think that the position of any us government would be that they would rather see peace and stability in the south china sea than conflict and instability uh yeah i'd like to add to that too i think you know this is also related to the previous question that steve asked about a new grand bargain or at least resetting the conversation i think all sides do want peace and cooperation i think biden will not change the policy on the south china sea or or not change the problems at least that we're dealing with but it he you know if he were to become president i think it will inject some stability and normalcy in the relationship which i think will help but honestly i think what we all need is more candor about what is is going on and you know like peter said recognizing that the other side has interests you know we need to talk about those interests more explicitly we need to talk about what's behind some of the activities and so when i think about fishing activities for example i mean there have been a lot of statements from all sides including china that there's a lot of potential here to come up with some kind of arrangement um but if you look at you know for example the sub the huge subsidy program that china has to send fishing vessels down to the spratly islands to fish i mean it's it's not there's no way that this is economically profitable for china nor is the catch that china is bringing in even contributing any relevant percentage of china's protein needs you know it's it you know if there were political will to establish some kind of arrangement it probably would have happened already and so i think we just need to be more real about you know what the presence really is and you know some of these fishing vessels which are actually maritime militia aren't even really fishing um and so i think we're not going to get to the heart of some of these problems unless we're able to talk about them in a very real way so i'll just quickly add steve if i might um you know our mutual friend jerry cohen says heaven's a wonderful place the question is how do you get there right and so and so the the point about you know the south china sea as this as this wonderful nirvana is is a great idea the question is how do you get there right and and uh you know this is why i am actually in in favor of wu shitsun's proposal to to to to re-energize dialogues at all levels track one track two dialogues as a starting point right as a starting point to get there and and this is my hope that that regardless of the outcome of the election there'll be a fresh opportunity to re-look at the possibility of you know of initiating these dialogues thank you go ahead and then and then let's go to the next question yeah go ahead yeah i think the key uh i think uncertainty is how serious pentagon will be to conduct some sort of central mail mail uh relations with beijing i think mr esper also mentioned in july yeah he would like to visit china until the end of this year i think his remarks also uh i think very positively echoed from china then i also see uh even pla also would like to see uh mr expert keep his words by the promise so far there's no you know the sign the pentagon would like to just uh get him back to the beijing and just re-energize re-energized male male uh talk at some sort of a very important level so i see the suspension for male male relations is some sort of uh consequence of a critical deterioration or is some sort of pentagon's new subordination to the traps you know such a very mad and even aggressive you know style it's my question for peter a good quick response to stephen's question on how to build a staff tennessee as a peace and corporation i think there are at least three preconditions to do so number one is to implement the medical corporation in a contender in the doc for instance environmental protection marine scientific research research and rescue and safety of navigation the second to reach consensus on the still see as soon as possible to build the lower base order in south china sea why the international community consumed the start tennessee issue because it lacks the security architecture so the coc once it is replaced will solve this problem number three the outside countries particularly united states not trying to force us in member states to choose side between china united states thank you three preconditions peter did you want to add anything i'm astonished to hear that we need to build a rule-based order in the south china sea we have a a very workable rules-based order that has applied around the globe to good effect all we need to do is apply it in the south tennessee and many of these problems go away the bonnie glazer has an interesting question for uh he's got a bunch of interesting questions but this this one i'll kick off with this one for about for either wushu trin or ju fung will china seek to prevent the philippines from accepting bids from international energy companies to develop gas at reed bank is joint development with a chinese company the only option available to the philippine government professor yeah i think bonnie raised a very good question then we'll also see uh the uh manila just to cancel any you know restriction to the south china sea based you know gas and oil exploration then uh it also well just a house that probably show uh some sort of uh uh diplomatic you know progress between beijing and manila because it's a based on some sort of uh we say consensus you know some sort of such a uh oil and a gas exploration probably well through some sort of their consensus but what does the consensus episode mean it's just the how say the exploration between chinese and filipinos companies i don't know i don't think so so like any concrete uh project probably could involve the third party i think it's it's it's it's out of a question so then my answer is that you know i think some sort of consensus between beijing and manila will open the door for uh you know participation of third parts or your company or serve our country if you want to add anything on that yes there was a successful case of a bilateral cooperation so-called joint development activities between china and the philippines from the year 2005 to 2008 actually it was a try apartheid corporation between china the philippines and vietnam so far the bilateral cooperation between the two oil companies of the philippines and china now is going smoothly i just find that just yesterday the philippine president took out you know council cancer researches on corporations foreign i think it was a good sign to promote such maritime cooperation between china philippines we call it the joint development activities between our two oil companies from my perspective it's not easy job to do so because jonathan development is so complicated and sensitive the important issue is to select the place which area is both except acceptable for chinese side and the fifth side so not easy in the future interesting i have something i'd love to add to that too so i know that this sounds possibly naive or unrealistic but i think it's something that we have to get on the table and the idea must be floated and that's the idea that we would leave the hydrocarbon in the seabed you know it's i was in seattle for a couple of weeks when i literally couldn't go outside because of our forest burning around us and the whole world is dealing with a lot of climate change issues and i do think we're at the point where we have alternative solutions it might mean rethinking you know some country's stances on nuclear power but i think there's a lot of potential there hydrogen and i i think it's something that we need to very seriously consider despite all of you know the momentum going in the other direction to drill drill drill but i think it's something that needs to be on the table great interesting um let's see president wu from your institution from hong nong and and matt garache what role is the quad you know united states japan australia and india are going to play in the region's strategic competition in the coming years let's one one either wushu tran the jewfong first speak to that and then peter tabitha or taylor speak to that yeah i think the quarter is a big concern um bella calming is particularly after some sort of deterioration of our biological relations then we consider for example a couple of the top diplomats and even very important pentagon officials also re-uh emphasize the necessity of formation of the asian version for nato so if a car called just the house they become um just another uh some sort of multilateral realignment movement in the region then of course from the chinese perspective we will be uh very very uh scared to be completely cornered so that's also china's concern over the court just the house they're surging but on other hands we're also consider it's not easy if the china could behave much better so peter and her taylor and teresa also mentioned some sort of chinese neither some sort of get off her behavior you know more welcome and a more you know base uh rule-based uh just oriented so then i see the court may be just in some sort of dynamic moment but the problem is my confidence is absolutely lying on some sort of china's korean regional economic and social influence on as i can't also see the china will be learning how to act more smartly i have had some thoughts and my concern is this with regard to the quarter mechanism initially quad mechanism is applied to in the ocean but i'm not quite sure whether the quarter mechanism will apply to the south china sea if the quarter cooperation mechanism is applied to the south china sea i think china would take uh that action circumstances so in that case that they will not be conducive to such as peace and stability so far the united states japan and australia have their military activities such as state but the indian knowledge send its warships into such and sea so it's my my concern i'm some you know as worrisome to that case peter tabitha peter if you want to do that one or two um i'm a little i've lost a little bit of the thread but i did see in some of the questions that there's a lot of questions about cues and i i do want to say a couple of things first um my my personal view is that that cues should apply across the board that um if we can include coast guard chips so much the better um and then secondly um i want to push back on something i think it was ju funk said and bonnie glazer raised in the questions which is um which is what are the special circumstances under which china believes that uh cues would not apply to military vessels in the south china sea it's those in my view it's exactly those special circumstances when it must be applied in order to ensure that we maintain stability between our militaries the non-experts please please describe what cues are sorry the code it's we keep talking about this it's the code for unexpected or honest unplanned encounters at sea right so it's it's in other words it's when when one sovereign vessel either navy or coast guard vessel encounters another there's a certain sort of process you're supposed to to to operate or to engage each other with in order to operate successfully even in times of tension and crisis and and so to suggest that there are times of tensions and crisis when it shouldn't apply is quite concerning i think you you suggested that or or am i wrong yes i did well then if you're asking for stability in the south china sea but saying china shouldn't follow the rules when there's you know conflict in crisis isn't that escalatory no i i i think you know we all know how complicated the uh south china sea uh maritime uh claims and even sovereign we say assertion among some sort of a very very contending you know clements so then i think the chinese mostly feel very very grievant because we're considered we are the first country to just uh made up some sort of essential sovereign claims in the non-dash line when we enjoy it back to 1946 we also got to the consent from the state department of the united states but now we think was the time change i think some sort of basic strategic you know concern of our american friends american governments to the east asia also very very dramatically changed so then i have to say yeah i i really love to see the china's korean resilience in handling the sushi rule-based order of course is also serving china's interest fully but on the other hand that will also see another indispensable part of a regional order is also power based it's not a china only then where we see the usa is mostly just working on that regard so then i really hope some sort of re-energization of the talks not just the housing multilaterally but also bilaterally and also could just that trade some sort of uh we say and pragmatically gauge some sort of a new diplomat you know the brexit could have just come true i think it will be need a lot of a passion and a lot of western but it's the only way we can get the south china sea conflict just to ease down so uh to respond to that if i might steve um you know in all seriousness when when those outside of china hear that china claims based on ancient history um the south china sea we think about should that mean rome claims all of the mediterranean no history moves forward and history and and all of human history moves forward along with the entire 20th century where together along with the people's republic of china we created the institution of the of the united nations convention on on the law of the sea china's the people's republic of china helped to create that all we're asking is that the people's republic of china apply it in the south china sea um and and it's deeply concerning to me to hear that you think that the that the cues should not be applied in certain times of crisis that's that's significantly destabilizing in my view cues is absolutely necessary and and insurmountable but the problem is given some sort of such a uh we say more complicated situation and even just the scenario based some sort of potential risk the cues is not enough at all so we need at least just a resume the whole level of flame milk contacts we need to get to the two militaries to build their acquaintance it's a very workable way to lower the hostility and the miscalculation so peter for this points i think lecusa is important but unless the way we should agree and re-energize some sort of all level for military talks even just the four years ago you know so nanjing is china's eastern military also headquartered so i did a lot of interview there they see yeah we have a very good military contacts with our american compass so some sort of such a compost contact is not adjustable then jose dismissal miscalculation most important thing is acquaintance building the um kind of a follow-up question to that from another participant in our in our track to dialogue admiral mike mcdivitt he he asks arguably u.s china attention over the south china sea would disappear almost overnight if china dropped its claim to historic rights in the associated nine-dash line do you think that's true no i i totally disagree please i don't think so i don't think so neither side is all chinese cringe based on the 99 historic rights is important for china crime you know with a very interesting socialist religion so i don't think it's impossible for china to abandon this line both asking if it could be abandoned that that the historical rights wouldn't tension dissipate because that's the basis of a lot of the conflict for china china should make clear what the historical right means it is important but it is impossible for china to abandon its historical rights claim and what chance you do is make clear what does historical rights means for china for chinese climbing over the south china sea you know both and uh mankind features and the night time to dixie claims i believe the convention of the law of the sea specifies what what historical rights can what claims you could make is that right peter or or taylor or tabitha yeah it's pretty clear the chinese have tried to find a way to to you know thread the needle outside of the convention but in fact um you know that this this is not um an approach to international law that that is accepted by either the arbitration panel or by by others you know frankly uh so china's claims to historic riots in the south china sea have no basis in international law and if if they do clarify them if they do clarify them as we should suggest at least we'll have a much better idea maybe there's some you know approach that could be accepted in international law but so far the broad claims that they've made just simply do not have a have a basis in international law and i tend to agree with admiral mcdevitt that a lot of the problems would go away if china conformed its approach to the south china sea to the convention you know some of the problems not all of them but also a significant proportion of the problems would go away if everyone were to decide to leave the hydrocarbon in the seabed it's kind of what started everything off in the 70s to begin with all the fighting i i would say one one point here i think i mean i've sort of described the the south china sea disputes is sort of being supercharged because you have a tradition you have territorial maritime claims plus you have shifting power dynamics and so if if the nine dash line were to go away that would remove a lot of the problems but i think you'd still have kind of the foundational uh shifting power dynamics that would certainly play out in the naval domain between the u.s and china and the south china sea and that would certainly stay so it would be an improvement but but i don't think it would be a total and complete amelioration of the potential for tensions in the south china sea between china and the united states so my view on that tabitha is that i agree with taylor and the reason i do is that i think that the chinese fundamentally the hydrocarbons in the south china sea don't really make an economic difference especially to china's economy they do to to some of the southeast asian economies but mostly they don't to china's economy my view is that the chinese uses the disputes for purposes of of status right to to impose rule sets to impose um to or to achieve status in relationship to southeast asians uh and and that's really the fundamental dynamic that isn't going to change yeah you know i agree with all of that you're not going to solve all the problems but you know just in terms of thinking of new approaches uh if we look at some international practices the historical rights are still with there if we will look at the case between yemen and victoria uh just in case the traditional accepted and then recognized the historical rights between him and the victorian kids i don't think that there is there was no place in the international law of the historical rights you now that's i've studied that case in great detail that's a case in which both parties ask the tribunal to make a special accommodation for them so this is that's a special accommodation not a rule of international law um so second you you said earlier wushutzun that china could never abandon its historic rights in the south tennessee i i find i i that that's just not accurate i mean of course china can taylor fravil our colleague here maybe you want to talk to this taylor you know he's written extensively on how china has has resolved you know disputes over territory with other countries that uh you know where china was was uh generous in its uh relinquishing claims to to uh to space china has made many circumstances in the past where because it achieved a benefit from for doing so it relinquished claims i just want to make that point i just i don't think it's going to be easy to get china to walk back on a a very clearly stated policy that it's upheld for a long time i mean i think you we just have to reframe the issue in a different way essentially it's one possibility i think yeah so then i think the latest cases we also know uh there is some sort of maritime disputes between the turkish and greece uh on the eastern mediterranean you know oil and gas exploration i think finally if you read the turkish's claim then it's also very very obviously contained some sort of such a history based there you know preoccupation in the eastern mediterranean area that has suffered a lot of protesting from greece so then my view is this all some sort of such a south china sea is disputes couldn't just absolutely just referring to for example uncross and cross just very important legal instrument but we also have another other you know the international legal instrument maybe we can also get could get them just a house a match app then uh it's also the bigger impression i got from chinese uh uh loyal and the legalist you know the community so they always say now the u.s just trying to overblown the chinese south china sea's claim just a very narrowly uh uh uh based on cross but the problem is and crosstalk is not all of international legal system so peter do you agree with that newfound this is not a u.s china issue right this is this china versus malaysia vietnam philippines alumni indonesia united states united kingdom germany france every one of these countries right has made clear how the rules of unklaus apply in the south china sea it's only china that is increasingly isolated in in this in its in its approach to its claims in the south china sea we're not talking about sovereignty over islands that's not what we're talking about we're talking about boundaries in the water space so china's increasingly isolated in that regard yes i agree so i see the china's situation with assassin's chelsea is a really deteriorating so we need to show the flexibility but i promise just the ways regard to the americans you know reinforce the military presence in south china sea to be uh uh chinese intellectual i found that it's getting harder for chinese communities to re you know uh uh enforce some sort of such a uh supposedly let's say uh flexibility i'm very honest yeah yeah there are a question to my american colleagues about the future pride to to coast guards is the possible to reach consensus speaking of two coast guards to apply the kills to coast guards because as i know the chinese you know because god is now he's reluctant to reach consensus with the u.s counterpart on this issue the base of hughes right is coal rags and which are earlier regulations so i think in principle there's no reason why you couldn't have a coast guard agreement that would apply the cues principles which themselves derive from other principles for maintaining sort of safety at sea so i think it would be a political question much more than a kind of a technical question yeah by the way speaking of of some of the law of the sea issues that that are kind of that are contentious between the united states and china you know uh mr bosco asked did the chinese participants believe that international support is growing for restrictions on military actions by that i think he means naval uh ships going through uh by other states in the eez so the majority of states support the u.s position that military vessels can go in there are a few states that side with china's position do you do fang and wushu chen think that china is getting additional support for its position well um basically no i i i don't see that way then where was he just a since the outbreak of the pandemic the south china sea church situation is increasingly unfavorable to china so i have to just like how say adam matthews is reality that's why i i really hope the beijing could show some sort of a growing flexibility and even creativeness not just the house a stabilizing lasagna c issue also could just a guest get some sort of such a increasingly disputable you know claims and become less disruptive and it just less disturbing to the china's regional diplomacy and the regional image but on the other hand i also see it as a very big part of such a growing contradiction and then see for example so us also just like how say uh initiate the indo-pacific strategy and so far the china just takes such a strategy as there's some sort of uh fully china targeting and the china containing so then even now in the chinese official vocabulary there's no some sort of such a acceptance of the words of indo-pacific we still use asia-pacific so some sort of a such exclusion of the indo-pacific franchise is official uh vocabulary then we will see it's some sort of a chinese growing uh uh alarming we say vigilance so then yes uh practically we will see there's some sort of such a optimal way to narrow down the little gap among the different sides but what's just got me very sad it's got me very stuttering is i see some sort of a real gap is still widening how would china respond if vietnam seeks arbitration through unclause to determine resource rights in vanguard bank that that question is from our track 2 dialogue participant isaac barton i don't think vietnam right now would do so to fire another arbitration case to either it lost icg because china and vietnam we have consensus to solve the relevant disputes of such an issue through a bilateral approach so if vietnam would do so it violates the consensus reached by our two countries if it is the case insistence to do so i think the chinese position will have no change uh compared with the philippines case no participation no acceptance let me we're running low on time so and i think there are some interesting consensus that have emerged from this discussion but as we need we need more track ones and track twos on on south china sea issues uh we need a rethink of policies both governments need to kind of think about it there's certainly consensus on the american side that no matter who was president on january 21st 2021 the u.s policy on the south china sea is not going to go uh not going to have a wholesale shift so my question is actually related to now through january 20th a period where i think you know president wu uh ju fung and others have kind of stated we're really nervous what's one thing that we should do to avoid uh a kinetic incident between now and and january 20th um and whichever order just put up your hand if you want to take a stab at that one moosha chen your hand was up first yeah yeah it is important both china united states particular united states should exercise the strength to you know take provocative actions in the tennessee region from now on till next january because this time is the key time for us to maintain peace and stability insurgency so it's important to exercise strength not to take at the provocative actions targeting at the left side i just mentioned in my presentation what united states should you do what channel should you do keep this strange try our best to avoid you know fight off potential possibility i think uh steve thanks i think first of all i need to say everything i've said today are my own personal views not meant to represent the us government's views but um the number one thing that we need to do is to follow the rules at all times follow the rules the code for unplanned encounters at sea the call regs etc follow them at all times that's how you maintain stability even in terms even in times of crisis and tension so uh if this is a particularly volatile time it becomes especially important to fund that we all follow the rules at all times yes so uh quickly just added i think there's a broadly shared conspiracy theory so-called conspiracy theory in china before the power transition uh by the uh next january 20 probably trump if he lose the occasion if he wanted just the how say taita some sort of he's a lower you know polling he may just trying to just hijack the china as a some sort of leading uh factor he can just force the entire americas to reunify that mean he probably will risk just like creating some sort of a military context military conflicts with the chinese and attending china factor into china crisis such a conspiracy culture conspiracy theory welcome to so it's our biggest concern taylor tabitha anything you want to add i just want to echo what what peter said and also add that at least uh one thing in the favor of stability also is the weather which deteriorates in the south china sea uh this time of year and hopefully keeps ships even farther apart from each other than they would otherwise normally be but again the best way to maintain stability is to follow uh the rules that both sides have agreed upon restraint uh which dr who mentions also is is is mutual right so it's not simply that one side or the other side should be restrained but if both sides are worried about maintaining stability then that should be shared to include um actions china might potentially take in the eas of other countries during this period and then finally uh on conspiracy theories um i mean like i love i love reading a great novel it's hard to know what to make of any of these um but one has to ask what would the real benefit be in the end for the president of the united states and usually these conspiracy theories just end with no benefit i don't think i would put much uh stock uh in in those stories uh i guess i i would i would add that i agree with the other commenters that following the rules is important i've also heard from other chinese counterparts that you know they're aware that this is a really tense time for the united states um and so i think that awareness is

fD863jx_tnE,"U.S. Navy to continue patrols near artificial islands claimed by China

美 해군 “남","Tensions between the United States and China are on the rise，... with both countries escalating a conflict over waters near artificial islands built by China in the South China Sea 
The U.S. Navy plans to conduct regular patrols around the islands， after China scrambled jets over the area. 
Connie Kim reports.
The U.S. Navy plans to conduct patrols within 12 nautical miles， or 20 kilometers， of man－made islands in the South China Sea，... in a move that is expected to further escalate Washington－Beijing tensions.
Reuters reports that a Pentagon official， speaking on condition of anonymity， said Monday the patrols，.. which will be carried out ″about twice a quarter，″... are to remind China and other countries about the United States′ right to freely navigate in the region under international law.
Twelve nautical miles around a territory is internationally recognized as sovereign territory， but the U.S. does not recognize China′s claim to the artificial islands it has built in the area.
Last week， an American destroyer sailed within the 12－nautical－mile limit of one of Beijing′s man－made islands... in the most significant challenge yet to China′s claim.
The Spratlys are a disputed group of more than 750 reefs， islets， atolls， cays and islands claimed by China and four other countries， including Vietnam and the Philippines. 
The conflicting claims have caused tensions in the region to rise in recent months.
Beijing says it will ″never allow any country″ to violate its territorial waters and airspace in the area.
In an apparent response to the U.S. challenge， China′s Navy is reported to have sent fighter jets over the Spratlys on Friday. 
Photographs of the aircraft were released by the Chinese Navy on Saturday but it did not elaborate on where the jets were operating from.
Retired Chinese General Xu Guangyu said Beijing intended to send a message with the exercises... that it is serious about its claims，... noting that it is the ″minimum level of response China should have， or it will fail the expectation of its people.″

GhaezvFI4is,Robredo: Gov’t should welcome rights probe,"MANILA, Philippines — Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday said the government should welcome the call of UN human rights experts for an independent probe on the rights situation in the country if the administration had nothing to hide on its record. “If it’s true that there are no human rights violations in our country, why should we oppose the investigation?” the Vice President said on her weekly radio show. Independent inquiry Eleven independent experts, including UN Special Rapporteurs Agnes Callamard and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, have called on the United Nations to conduct an independent probe on the country, saying they have recorded a “staggering number of unlawful deaths and police killings” under the war on drugs launched by the Duterte administration in 2016. The experts also stressed that “very few independent and effective investigations” on the killings and rights violations had taken place since then. “The government has shown no indication that they will step up to fulfill their obligation to conduct prompt and full investigation into these cases and to hold perpetrators accountable,” read the statement released on Friday. ‘Outrageous interference’ Malacañang has dismissed the call, calling it “intellectually challenged” and an “outrageous interference [in] Philippine sovereignty.” Robredo said, however, that rejecting the call only added doubt to the government’s human rights record. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), for its part, has accused the UN human rights experts of undermining the country’s sovereignty and the credibility of multilateral dialogue. DFA rejects call “We reject this call as it is being made in bad faith by parties who want to undermine domestic processes and spread disinformation, on the basis of one-sided reports coming from questionable sources,” the DFA said in a brief statement late on Saturday. The UN rapporteurs continue to ignore the government’s side, the DFA said. “These parties show their bias and political agenda and assail the credibility and objectivity of the human rights mechanisms as constructive platforms of dialogue between the United Nations and the member states,” the DFA said. Senate President Vicente Sotto III on Sunday said human rights advocates could be part of drug syndicates or were drug users themselves for pushing for an international inquiry into the unprecedented killings under President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly drug war. “I don’t get them. I’m beginning to suspect that these UN human rights [experts] are behind [the proliferation of] illegal drugs or they are users that’s why they are very angry about this matter,” Sotto said in a radio interview. Protect rights workers “There are worse cases of killings in other parts of the world because the laws are not being enforced,” he continued. Meanwhile, detained Sen. Leila de Lima vowed to again push for the enactment of a measure intended to protect human rights workers from threats and harassment in the 18th Congress. “I find it important that we pass a measure protecting human rights defenders, especially after the recent incidences of killings involving them, which proves that their work has become extremely dangerous,” De Lima said in a handwritten dispatch from her detention cell at Camp Crame. 
 Despite the international criticism against the President’s anti-illegal drugs campaign, the Philippines was reelected for a fresh three-year term in the council beginning Jan. 1, 2019....

hHyFXgnkDPs,Can a new framework on South China Sea bring Beijing and Manila closer?,"Talks between China and the Philippines on Friday will come under a new ""bilateral consultation mechanism"" that will help solve their territorial dispute in the South China Sea. Under this framework, the two countries will meet twice every year. And this time, both sides expect the talks will bring them closer to a peaceful resolution. 

On Thursday, China and ASEAN member states also held talks on establishing a framework for a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, and continuing discussions on the DOC.

The dispute over the maritime body previously strained diplomatic ties between China and the Philippines, and last year's arbitration, which was initiated unilaterally by Manila, further deteriorated bilateral relations. But ties have normalized since President Rodrigo Duterte took office last year. Abandoning the policy of his predecessor, Duterte sought to repair ties with China and resolve the South China Sea issue through dialogue, which Beijing has long called for to settle differences in the maritime body.

Can the new mechanism between China and the Philippines bring the territorial dispute to an end? Yang Xiyu, Senior Research Fellow at the China Institute of International Studies and Richard Heydarian, Political Science Professor at De La Salle University in Manila, share their opinions.

Weibo: http://weibo.com/cctvnewsbeijing",0,for more discussion on China Philippines relations first consultation meeting on the South China Sea we're joined in our Beijing studio mr. yang Zhi Luke with a senior research fellow from the China Institute of International Studies welcome to our program sir joining us in Manila we are having mr. Richard he Darian political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila welcome as well professor professor Gary I want to start with you this bilateral consultation mechanism hard to come by yet eventually we have something like this how much can we expect it about it on Friday well I mean first of all this is a product of recognition by both sides particularly the Philippines that the two sides have to revive their institutionalized mechanisms for dialogue which are almost frozen in the past few years when they need action administration was empowering and the idea there is that of course there are still disputes between the two neighbors and those disputes have to be dealt with and the best way to manage that is to revive those institutional institutionalize dialogue mechanisms and I think this is the first of its kind and it's led by very able people I mean the Philippine ambassador there is Tito Santa Ramana of what's based in China for four decades so he really understands the country and he's also someone I think was capable enough to oversee not only revival of bilateral ties but also a steering both sides toward finding a mutually acceptable compromise right if you're young when the his Excellency mr. ambassador from the Philippines to China was being asked about exactly what are the positions of the Filipino side he said that he said talking points are still being prepared at this point but what is important is there is a mechanism well the imagination actually will put a base for the stable parrot relation no matter what kind of shock differences that having there and based on the stable base the two countries will be able to manage the differences and meanwhile to explore broader room for the cooperation in this maritime so I think through this the mechanism China and the Philippines will open a new model to solve this complicated issue talking about this new model professor hidari I really want to ask you about this because earlier there has been a lot of debate as to what kind of mechanism would help to solve the dispute of territories earlier it is merely only China and adjusting with audience which is a multilateral platform China has been proposing to have bilateral and it seems this time sorry to cut you short professor catarrian this is the very beginning of it professor I mean definitely I think the Philippine perspective is that there should be complementarity under the age of Ages of the ASEAN there should be a constant consultation between the two sides as you perfectly know there was just an agreement between China and ASEAN on a framework of the code of conduct so the multilateral tract is moving forward what was lacking the previous years was a bilateral trap to complement the multilateral trap that's why this bilateral consultative mechanism is very important thing and I think it allows the two countries to have a much more focused discussion much more frank discussion to be more clear about their bottom line and red lines in ways that they could not be under the aegis of the ASEAN because of science based on consensus and so much more complicated mechanism so the bilateral allows for the two sides have much more Frank and straightforward this coming think about a museum I mean earlier China the Philippines work the sharpest in differences when it on the territory yo the other occupation but now they are taking this pioneering step to show to the others there are ways to resolve it this is a sea change what is contributing to this dramatic change that we have seen right now well I think no matter what kind of results coming out from the mechanism the messenger has opened nobody should expect a larger with one day's conversation on video yeah but it's opens away for number one civilizing this issue and the number to try efforts to find a solution through equal footing and the front needs consultations although it will take a long time and take a long way to reach that goal basically this Magnuson clarifies the complex issue in a true level of problems number one how to manage under control and resolve these differences among climbers under number two how to maintain the peace Authority including freedom of passages so regarding to the first carrier categories problems bilateral consultations among and between Clemens and number two consultation and negotiation between China and ASEAN so title is the greatness that is the importance for this flood map interior seems to be some very interesting convenience a prophetic variant because right now Philippine is the rotating president of ASEAN and we are seeing this bilateral mechanism being established certainly this can be a case study that the other Asian nations can study and also follow up with Professor catarrian well I mean first of all we have to recognize here that the reason why Philippine China relations are at the very blossoming stage is precisely because president rodrigo duterte history is really expanding his political capital to forge ahead with better relations with china and i think at the heart of his calculation is improved bilateral economic relations remember this bilateral consultative mechanism is coming only days after that make us some it the one road one belt initiative summit in china where the dirty got to meet for the second time President Xi Jinping and also Premier Li Keqiang and something very important also happened China also offered a 500 million dollar loan to the Philippine military which has been quite suspicious of China and was quite trying to resist China's I feel paratis opening of you know ties with china but now I think even the Philippine military is willing to give benefited out and I think the two sides are now also looking at having joint military exercises and signing new Memorandum of Understanding Zoar agreements that allow the two militaries of the two countries to also have better confidence-building measures and better relationship so things are moving very fast but I think the third has played a very important role in the revival of bilateral ties what you're talking about arsalan that concrete a cooperation possibilities between China and Philippines even though it is in money way but certainly could pave certain kinds a way for coming becoming more trustful of one another once these projects begin at least you're young to infrastructure project to bridges likely to be built in the Philippines and also a real way on the island of Mindanao these are all promised by China through the belt and Road initiative from China to the Philippines but also a mr. young as you may know very well dr. Road initiative is not China's initiative but rather a proposal put forward by China and lets everybody join in so how should we see also this kind of cooperation China and ability in bilateral mean well multilateral as well well first of all are trying to regard the Philippines as one of the important players and the participants in the one belt by Road initiative all programs and number two when the two sides begin to successfully manage of the differences on the maritime and 10-page the two sides that began to churn the broader range of corporations support supported by the one Road by over one belt and a program so I think the pilot relation will go into a golden period really golden period mr. hidari and professor you may know infrastructure project takes years to go through and complete will that be the foundation for further protected trust between these two countries well I mean much will also depend on a doTERRA test relationship with the United States as we all know the other week Donald Trump just called the turret and invited the turtle over the White House and based on what I know their plans for dessert to visit Washington DC around September October and then by November Trump is expected to visit Manila for the East Asia Summit so there are also some movements on the part of us Philippine relations and I think are to a great extent that will impact how far the thirty can go in terms of his own pivot towards China I think in the end the Philippines might revert to the mean whereby it will have good relationship with both sides but not fully satisfy any of the two big powers I think this is the dilemma the Philippines is facing the second dilemma the Philippines facing domestic pressure there's a lot of pressure on the Philippines to raise its arbitration case against the Philip against China last year in the bilateral consultative mechanism and I think that's a difficult thing so of you know ambassador cheetahs and Romano of the Philippines is trying to reassure the Philippine Republic that the Philippines with Spanish ground but I'd say that I'm sure he knows that with China that's a red line in China is not going to discuss that issue at all so that's going to be quite a tricky you know situation and I think that's why we have to carefully follow what's going to happen but I think the Alliance is going to be the first meeting so in the first meeting I think it's going to be more of confidence-building measure and later on more discussion of tricky things let's talk about these two points a mr. young from China first of all it is about that too specific China us-philippine triangle relationship but many wonder from China's perspective is it a zero-sum game meaning once the Philippines is getting better relations with the United States which China feel scared about that because I will be yesterday once more or should Philippines or the United States feel scared with one of those parties getting ever closer to China mr. Yong well first of all China recognized that the triangle relation is the reality but what what can wave think in China has to deal with the triangle you mentioned the zero-sum game that is absolutely no way for China China made Thatcher if China go into the do some games the style to manage the trilateral and all of the parties including China will lose and so all my efforts made by ji mean it tried to get a win-win result through positive interactions among parties for example he has a set up very good working relationship with President Trump and as well before the trouble working relationship GDP has a part a very good personal relationship with president a president dealt with early so based on the post try electropositive interaction and the table leaders good working relationship I think the trilateral will go into a positive rather than negative direction professor Guderian it seems that the presidential Turkey has been very skillful since he comes into the office about his relations with the United States and also with China some even suggest that this guy has managed to make the most out of this triangle relations having said that though professor Guderian at this point how I really think how do you think Philippine is thinking particularly the fact that Washington right now is still a little bit confusing to the outside world to say the least politically how will prism do turkey and his administration figure out what to do well I mean I really feel for China because presentation drink we now have to deal with two very mercurial characters both in Washington DC and Manila and I think there's putting a lot of pressure on China I mean in terms of how to deal with in with the two countries in this triangle of US and the Philippines I think as far as the third is concerned we have to be very realistic that he actually tends to personalize foreign policy I mean one reason that he downgraded bilateral security cooperation with us last year was not only because he wanted to send his goodwill to China improve relations with China it was also because he was extremely offended personally by America's criticism of his war on drugs of his human rights record but now we do on a Trump it's a very different picture in fact Donald Trump when he called the third day he almost praised a you know the terrorist war on drugs and and that actually sat very well with dessert and I think the dessert the administration looks forward to the summit and meeting meeting the two sides so I think there are some you know unpredictable imponderables here that China has to be very worried about and the other thing is that sometimes there's a gap between what the test says and what his administration actually does so like just the other day auditor two said that the Philippines is not going to accept any aid from the European Union and then now you certainly have the department of foreign I first thing we do have no idea about this announcement and the economy minister mr. Pena saying that there was no consultation with me I'm not sure this is final so I think that's the other thing you have to keep in mind that Duterte tends to be sometimes too spontaneous so there's a there's always a lag between what you tell me what you want and what his administration does I think that's why this is quite a difficult situation for China to and that's why China has to tread very carefully in dealing both with the United States and the Philippines this kind of wants to use the word difficult to describe the uncertainty right now mr. young particularly dealing with a leader who is quite charismatic like a president who served a well I don't where 2012 I can Washington yep let me put it this way yes China really facing difficulties to deal with and the - a trial or the trilateral relation however the advantage for China facing the trollidays we have a different category of four difficulties with the US and with the Philippines respectively for example we have a different issues with us from the issues with the Philippines and that the only risky situation is if you as increasing their involvement in the disputes in South China Sea then China will face a real risky and a typical situation so China we on one hand try to civilize relations with the Philippines and our team as I as we have done like a mechanism like the COC acceleration meditation so that we can exclude the unnecessary Outsiders interventions and the meanwhile we increase our efforts on the china-us relation towards the positive direction so it's a pretty complicated management and so it's actually about creating trust on both sides on the one hand do that with the United States on the other hand China do that with its neighbors including the Philippines one thing I want to follow up on mr. Jung is about the arbitration professor Guderian earlier mentioned he talked about the internal pressure president to Turkey to : called act at least there are some degree of pressure so president mr. young what do you think about that factor and how much do you think internal issues inside the Philippines is likely to drive further president the Turkish agenda with Beijing well first of all China will insist on the principle long time resisting principle of for non intervention in the Temescal politics in any other country also including the Philippines are China has very in mind what may be the result but you know the domestic disputes about arbitration very closely linked to China's national interest so China has to closely watching this development of the debate and as long as the governmentís arbitration of the pre-teens continue the peaceful manner with China to this issue China will keep the cooperation but before the policies from the manila change China has to adjust the current policy Chinese you so it's all moving factors we're talking about here but one thing is for certain on Friday the Chinese side and the Philippine side are going to sit down in we on to talk about this mechanism bilateral mechanism and to quite resolve the conflict and the different opinions what can we expect a 30 second from each of you mr. yang go first increasing mutual trust and building confidence measures that is the base for the possible future development big word professor his area what about you it's all about building communication channels building hotlines and avoiding conflict between the two sides with a coast guard whether fishermen whether military on the ground I think so long as there's no major conflagration on the ground there in the disputed areas on the trajectory of bilateral relationship between Clippers and China is going to be positive to build a palace one has to start from laying the very first brick I guess it is a palace we're talking about here between China and the Philippines laying that break on Friday thank you so much for both of you gentlemen joining us Richard hi Darren joining us from Manila in the Philippines young she is joining us here in Beijing thank you so much really appreciate it
iwbo5f2xgOY,How China Is Transforming Southeast Asia,"In recent years, China and Southeast Asia have engaged in increasingly complex economic and security relations. Even with deepening diplomatic, cultural, and economic ties, tensions remain. From China’s nine-dash line and the String of Pearls, to its rapidly expanding infrastructure network under the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s growing influence in the region is both visible and invisible. To spectators around the world, China’s rise may be cause for alarm, but for Southeast Asia, China may also be considered an ally in advancing regional economic growth. Do Belt and Road projects represent an avenue for long-term connectivity and growth or are they risky investments that threaten to entrap countries in unsustainable debt? How can Southeast Asia balance the trade-off between its deepening partnership with China with regional security and cohesion?

#ChineseEconomy #China #SouthEastAsia",0,"good afternoon my name is Kirk West and I have the the pleasure of moderating how China is transforming Southeast Asia Pennell we know it's five o'clock so we are going to try and keep it punchy and still leave time to time for questions so let me kick off the economic and political relationship between China and Southeast Asia is clearly complex and while some particularly in the West would see the ascent of China to superpower status as a threat there are many in Southeast Asia who see China as an ally for economic growth that said there are tensions and today's panel will certainly bubble some of those tensions to the surface now I could spend the rest of the panel time just introducing the panelists have given their experience but I will refer you to the bio and just quickly refer to them by their name and their current role and we have Paul here who's the chief economist at S&P global robin who of course is head of sustainability and stewardship at tamasic international to my left I think you would have seen Jonathan at lunch time who is a senior partner at McKinsey Global Institute and Tan Sri Francis yo of course who's the executive chairman of the YTL group of companies now I'm sure everyone here would like to hear the views of these panelists on the current US a China trade dispute and we will get to that but I thought we'd start by what with a couple of issues which I think will have a longer duration and those being the South China Sea dispute and Bri so and which is something which has already been touched on on a number of panels today so let's start with the South China Sea dispute and I'm going to ask Robin to maybe if you could set the scene by giving us a geopolitical kind of perspective of how that affects the relationship between China and Southeast Asia well Curt in an hour yeah thank you I think China's strategic aim of the South China Sea is to legitimize his claim over 80 percent of the sea right and China have repeatedly and publicly stated that the South China Sea is of strategic core interest to the country and what that means it is on the same pedesta as Singh Jung Tibet in Taiwan and therefore is a red line for China now a third of the world's trade passes through the South China Sea and it has an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and that is untapped as well as 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas so it is not as if it is something that is not worth having so five ASEAN countries are variously clements of the three cluster of islands in the South China Sea that we read variously on a paper that is the Paracel the Scarborough and as far as Spratly so sovereignty over 200 miles of nautical miles of the exclusive economic zone that is you know away from your shoreline various times a resource of coral and dispute and the countries are Vietnam Thailand Indonesia Brunei and Malaysia now since 2013 China has claimed 3,200 acres of new land on the various islands in South China Sea and the other five Clemen countries have claimed a total about a thousand but it should be noted that China was in the first country that started this race of reclamation it was Vietnam who started it first and the u.s. decided I was not worth his training hence of course we have the situation where we are today now it is well reported in the 2012 scarborough show standoff between Philippines and China which lasted more than two months which resulted ultimately in the Philippine Philippines backing off which therefore receding control to China and of course we all know in 2006 Philippines to the case to the two hate which is the the ultimate code of arbitration the ruling was given Indonesia Philippines won the case and China refused of course to accept the ruling now against this particular contact the US in a meantime have conducted six freedom of navigation expedition or operations into the South China Sea six times and therefore bolstering the friendship and support of ASEAN partners now since then with a new president in Philippines as well as some more pressing job political activities in Washington such as NAFTA such as sign a sign a US trade war and among other things the tension in South China Sea have subsided so on a China side to dampen the tensions with ASEAN countries as well as the US China agreed to enter into the negotiation to what is known as the code of conduct so a text is to be developed and hopefully will be binding and that was a decision that was reached a year ago among the foreign ministers meeting of ASEAN here in Singapore since then no date has been set on when the exact discussion and negotiation will be held so basically we are in a hibernation mode in a moment and China's preference is to settle all disputes within what is called the Asian members of family however that is not compatible with the Western liberal order which is constructed by the u.s. following the Second World War so the temperature of the South China Sea is come in a moment but we never know because it is always a function of the us-china relations so we live interesting and perhaps dangerous times Thank You Robin ah Jonathan I mean you've been based out of China for over 30 years and you've been involved in a whole range of kind of regional growth kind of projects Robin talked a lot about resources maybe I can ask you to touch on maybe trade or the kind of the global kind of in terms of this trade and maybe even the China perspective well I mean I think that the nice thing about working in Asia is that Asia is still kind of very business friendly and I think that in spite of all of the conflicts and possible opportunities for you know disputes nonetheless Asia continues to grow based on trade and based on flows of investment of goods and services of capital of people data and that that is a pretty remarkable thing I mean 20 years ago intra Asia trade was maybe 15 percent of global trade now it's up to about 25 so a huge expansion of the connectivity of the region through business and I think that's you know it so that's to be celebrated we know that places that are better connected grow faster and they get there more in the flow there more in the flow of technology of of trade of investments of again capital and people so so to Southeast Asia and China I think we've seen I think now China's Southeast Asia's number one trade partner they could hit half a trillion dollars last year the you know it's the fastest growing trade partner for China and as we see China moving along the value-added of its own exports instead of moving more firmly into R&D intensive and capital intensive goods it's creating an opportunity for many of the second tier of Southeast Asian countries to catch up so Vietnam and Myanmar and Cambodia have all been jumping into the fields where China essentially has moved on because of its rising costs so I think that you know in the in some ways you know with their letter there's a lot of Chinese opera going on so that we look at the stages and those face masks and so it's entertaining at best but you know distracting at worst and we should focus on the actual work that's being done by many of you to knit this region together and create growth opportunities for all okay I think you Jonathan Francis Robin mentioned the Spratly Islands and of course Malaysia has a sovereignty claim on those islands as a practitioner in business I mean is this an issue that you've had to navigate at all I think I like to address this issue is a bit more dangerous than addressing the symptoms they are maybe I can highlight four of many events that you may not put them together but if you look at Trump's recent withdrawal of four ambassadors for supporting China rather than Taiwan is one signal and Spratly Islands claim is another signal American opposition to China's vision 2025 is another signal and trade war is another signal you think these are not connected but they have been connecting and connecting for a while I think people forget global power shift in the world never never is easy when one superpower or one system from feudal to Republican there will be violence in so super power and we have in the midst of this struggle and these are the symptoms of a superpower us shifting and worrying about China's becoming a superpower and the impact on United States and the world so you can see this this quite clearly if you connect all the dots why are these issues not going away and China like my friend am a success has a few red lines Taiwan is a red line and is beginning to be breached and you can see China today is not in a mood like Jing ping to to to capitulate as he china capitulated to the west for a long time he's not going to go down in history as a capital later and that's why when the trade war came teaching being retaliated now what if what if there is a big call on Taiwan the red line and world sitting bring also react so there must become heads now we are in the midst of a very dangerous period where accidents can happen and most of these wars in the past if you look at the history are accidental Duga Ferdinand assassinated every war is an accident of such a small accident and then it triggers a war because a galvanization of all the hatred it's now quite ready if we move forward with our solution in a year or two you really fight sir for example the ASEAN emerging economies the currencies are quite weak if it's a contagion it will not be able to stand this huge big joke political plays so I wish for both parties to really have come heads and come minds and stop this because this is really not themselves but it could galvanize many forces that are not controllable and accidents can actually happen ok I'm gonna get back to your Robbins kind of taught by sheikh francis just taught about how the dispute is really just one hot spot it's part of a bigger picture I'd like to maybe now come back to sustainability though and the blue ocean is is a it's a concept which is often talked about in terms of how in a sustainable economic development with industry and governments working together asking you to put your your head wear your hat on in terms of head of sustainability at Tomas it can you maybe give give us some insights from a sustainability perspective ok usually we don't think of sustainability in the context of South China Sea but this is a sure nonetheless a very interesting question I think much of the emphasis in the tension there's too much of that is on the military aspect or the job politics expect of South China Sea very little is mentioned or talked about on the impending disaster found a biodiversity or the pollution standpoint of the sea which is actually a equally important and some regard as a more important problem I would just you know maybe highlight a couple issues here which I think to me would be the problems of the day and one of which will be overfishing mmm that is actually a very serious problem in in you know in our part of the world and the second thing that was plastic a pollution of the ocean as well so those are two issue that perhaps everybody here will be fairly familiar with and I just saw a little bit first of all overfishing well the South China Sea is the world's top five most productive fishing zones now that's probably not a good news accounting for about twelve percent of the global fish that was caught in the Year 2015 I couldn't find any later you know statistics but 2,200 2015 is about twelve percent of the total world are fishing and that is reported right so more than half of the fishing vessels in the world operate in these waters so twelve percent of the fishing but half the world's fishing vessels operate in this part of the world I just give will give you a sense of how many people are dependent on on their livelihood in in in this part of the world and I supports about 3.7 million people whose livelihood that's related to fishing in Southeast Asia and that doesn't include it you know that does not include anything that's unreported right so obviously there's some illegal fishing that goes on these part of us as well so the estimates suggest that in order to prevent a industry collapse you know of the entire fishing ecosystem that is some form of a immediate halt to the destructive method of fishing and practices has to take place and then what it also means is about 50% of the volume of fishing we have to stop as well now if you put this thing just a couple of things together and you realize the enormity of the of the challenge because it is essentially is possible because people's lives are impacted so what we really need to find is therefore our turn ative methods of fish and protein production and that will enable them to have another form of livelihood at the same time so what is that I think you know a few areas maybe it's worth talking about and maybe one of which will be alternative methods of fish production which may be sea farming for example that's taking place in quite a few countries as well but not in novel guys in place another thing maybe indoor vertical aquaculture not may be yet another solution and other protein substitutes for which intimacy has invested in a few companies as well that is you know in soy instead of having a beef burger that made out of beef that you can have protein substitute that actually tastes equally delicious if you haven't tried it I would recommend that you next time go into a restaurant and try one of those so alternative proteins and alternative protein to fish which is a cheaper form approaching are indeed some of the technological advancement that's taking place now there's of course the issue of pollution of the plastic as well let me give you some statistics about 8 million metric tons of plastic find his way into the ocean and from primarily 5 countries in our part of the world Thailand Vietnam Philippines China and Indonesia now we're able to find a solution or proper waste management waste treatment in those countries that we're probably going to begin to be able to find some solution but that's a very long topic I don't want to take up all the time of here so I mention two things ocean pollution of plastics and as well as alternative to to fishing thank Thank You Robin I'm gonna move on but I think a question time I were a number of issues there be you know through fishing through trade be it through potential or managing a potential conflict a lot of weight and of course resources earlier so lots of way to go but let's talk about Bri now and of course China will talk about that's a better future through regional connectivity others would say well no this is you know China's move towards trying to have you know influence kind of global policies through it through a network Paul a lot of the discussion comes down to infrastructure you know in China will talk about how they're they're providing necessary infrastructure for development in the region others would say it's the wrong type of infrastructure maybe you can give it any your perspective and maybe the economics of it all you sure the well first of all it's it's complicated right this is a decade-long project it's hyper ambitious being compared with the Marshall Plan that the u.s. did after the Second World War this might sound funny coming from an economist but I think the way to best kind of analyze the Bri is to look at a map and when you look at the map remember two things one China for the foreseeable future will be the largest net energy importing country in the world and two most of the energy they need is in the middle-east and three most of that energy flows through the ocean around the Strait of Malacca here in Singapore back up into the South China Sea which we just just discussed so when you think about the major projects under Bri so far and including some of the tension points we've seen let's kind of go through a couple of those one in in Pakistan we've got a deep water port Ecuador with a pipeline running through Pakistan into western China which bypasses the Straits of Malacca we've got another big infrastructure project in Myanmar another port another pipeline that goes through Myanmar from the Andaman Sea bypassing the Straits of Malacca China's building the biggest dry port in the world on the border with Kazakhstan along with a couple of pipelines one for gas into Turkmenistan and one for oil into Kazakhstan also bypassing the Straits of Malacca and there's other pipelines going up into into eastern Russia for the same region so when you look at the Bri projects you see things that are needed we have sort of roads bridges electrical grids things like that and then you see these projects that look like they're connected with China's energy security and in a way that's rational China wants to diversify away from reliance on the Straits of Malacca where 80% of its oil and 50% of its gas imports pass through so it's kind of a mix of I think China's exporting something it's quite good at which is infrastructure and it's combining it with its regional global ambitions and trying to secure energy security and where those two conflict that's where we're seeing some of the tension and you know Xi Jingping gave this speech at the at the African Congress I think last week to what extent that can be managed and to what extent those can be disentangled those two types of infrastructure I think is going to be quite quite important as we this is going to last for a while this is not going to be the end of be all right thank you poor Jonathan this provision of capital capital that has to be paid back is poor alluded to in your view is it providing or developing the right skill base that these these countries need for the long term well I'm that's a great question I mean because I think that it highlights the point that capital alone generally speaking doesn't solve the problem I mean that we can find plenty of examples of bridges to nowhere and airports that haven't been used and so and so infrastructure isn't magic I mean it's not it has to complement economic activity and if there isn't any then there won't be any value in that infrastructure so I think I think the belton Road initiative has discovered that maybe somewhat belatedly and as a result has moved away from thinking simply about points to more about corridors and corridors that are developed economic that are premise taun economic development so that that may I think has become more the focus of those larger infrastructure projects going forward and I have to say that I just was reading a fascinating report that said that a ten you know that it was tracking light outputs and illumines across maps of countries where aid projects and they analyzed 1,500 aid projects over the last twenty nine 15 years and and and tracked the Chinese who who was doing these projects development projects and Chinese versus others and like a long story short what they found was and this is from a data I believe the name of the group who said that a ten percent increase in Chinese development finance resulted in a 1% increase in light output and which translated into a zero point three percent increase in GDP Wow so and essentially the hypothesis being that these Chinese projects are going into the places where the previous generation of Western projects had not gone that the majority of the Western projects were focused on the very larger cities and metropolis and clusters and by the Chinese projects were going to rail and and to distributed power in in more remote areas and with good or bad consequences but overall of creating this more access to and to economic development for broader strictures of population so be that as it may I just think that it's interesting to show visually how this is this is playing out as to the skills fair enough I only want to make one other point between most people's estimates of bricks of belt and wrote initiatives spending in a year it's anywhere between 15 billion and 35 billion or something like that the American Enterprise Institute I think has it at 35 and I think the Mothe comm says 15 so true merging Asia X China infrastructure spend annually half a trillion the you know the math here speaks for who needs to be having the skills I I think it's it's you know clearly the responsibility of the host countries to develop the capacities to raise and spend that money in an effective way and China can help and China can be or hurt but it's ultimately it's a it's in its it's it's the responsibility of the host countries thank you Jonathan Francis I don't know if you want to comment on there but certainly one thing I I wanted to ask I mean it's been a recent change in government in Malaysia and they've started to review some of the Bri initiatives which were put in place by the previous government can you give us a perspective on that and how you how you see that may be playing out I'll speak less than that I like this continue this subject is very important about the global infrastructure all the projects that build bridges to nowhere Europe has got 10,000 bridges waiting to collapse like the one in Italy and in America as well and we have to remind ourselves trillions of quantitative easing in Europe and America has not produced infrastructure whereas the Chinese has pumped infrastructure truly fast trains and their ports and their roads allow Alibaba on a single day to do 17 billion u.s. worth of business delivered within two days with the first rains I don't think America can do that and understand how to do that what it takes to do that why can't we replicate this yes so the Chinese are trying to do it to Bri not in a very clever articulated way it looks like is a Chinese project heavy-handed of course the Western press has lots to do with that etc because of this shifting global power thing which I described not easy to see things clearly as benign but the Chinese - has not also been able to convey this message clearly but the Bri is 8 times the size of the Marshall Plan since the Marshall Plan in Europe that built Europe's productivity has not been in investment in infrastructure United States has not built much infrastructure after after after the Eisenhower highways and airports look at how crumble yeah the point is where are all these trillions why are they not built in infrastructure while we are talking and talking no money is still going into infrastructure because the regulatory framework is not transparent and clear in its leaves with politics all the time they don't seem to understand leaders today how important it is to provide hot infrastructure so that the digital infrastructure alibaba's of the world can ride on it they have not been able to end infrastructure development taking years is expensive and it's a long-term project so if you don't set up a regulatory framework for the world to invest you can talk to the cows come home you will not have infrastructure that create a lost trash to people it does not improve people's life jobs are being replaced because of lack of productivity and this terrible swedish phenomenon of the right coming is not difficult to understand the the middle class are not seeing any improvement well while the top tier enjoying themselves in a way but the most people are not seeing any any hope what can they do but to actually you know complain and get leaders hopefully that would change whoever they are Donna like anybody because they're fed up of leaders not able to do the simple stuff of providing utility competitive utility infrastructure to improve their lives in every way so this is where we are at the moment and then the echoed a point tonight in your manual don't eat fish because plastics didn't fish so if you eat fish today you're also eating plastics my great friend Prince Charles that highlighted that in Malta it's true we have to do something about that two leaders are actually called a duty today they are being distracted so what are you what do you think you and I can do you must do if we actually neglect and hope that the politicians and the leaders can do with all the problems they have in your hands to solve it you've got to be dreaming but you've got to do something we've got to do something I don't know how but we hopefully when we do something accidentally the leaders will follow and do something right but if we don't the accidents that can happen are much more dangerous if we don't do anything about it it's up to the business people to really take up this challenge now No thank you very much Francis Robin oh I was also going to ask you about the skill bases one I'd be interested if you don't touch on it but also again maybe an environmental perspective of Bri to you okay let me just pick up on what friends just said I mean you see the America has the world greatest largest private equity industry and yet the money doesn't go into the refreshing and redevelop of the infrastructure there's a very good reason for it it must be because there's no returns well not good enough China doesn't have a huge private equity industry it's there is one is burgeoning their money also all going to infrastructure yeah right so what is the difference I think the difference is government right now the US may be the world's you know greatest democracy and china is the world's largest socialist state but equally they are the world greatest bureaucracies right now I think there we have it right so China back to your Bri coming now China has committed or pledged or embarked or in a few instances completed Bri projects across all ASEAN countries and it's fairly long list and I will say that he ranges from maybe hundreds of millions to billions of dollars for each of the project right I mean there's a Huell Angeles if you look today is going to be quite impressive now a common lament of the recipient nations is that despite of all the investments and all the huge infrastructure projects there's a lack of local employment opportunities so a complaint that the SOE is which has been trusted with the projects seem to have be ignoring right now the SOE tend to airdrop the entire ecosystem from the engineers to the construction workers to the chefs to the kitchen hand into the countries do to do the project and then when the project is done they move away or mess as well so there is no local employment there's no local sourcing or there's very little of that maybe there's some but it's not enough so so China can do more to embrace the local stakeholders a lot more buy more from from them source more from them creating more opportunities for jobs and so on China can also do more to embrace more stakeholders the labor unions locally for example the NGOs locally the environmentalists locally the private enterprises locally and more because the more stakeholders you're able to bring down to your side the more likely you are going to be able to succeed and I think on that China is learning and what they replicating is the old SOE model in China into Africa and from Africa into ASEAN and the pace of evolution and I think has not been sufficiently impressive or fast enough let me just give an example the uses Singapore as an example in a 70s and 80s when Singapore began the journey of industrialization there were institutions such as the Japan Singapore Institute there was the French Singapore Institute there was the German Singapore Institute so they were creating establishes Singapore with the help of the French German Japanese companies business associations and the government right and that helped accelerate the industrialization a process of Singapore because they created and trained skilled people engineers technicians and workers and without those institutions Singapore's industrialization which continued to be 20% of our GDP would not have happened and we would not be where we are today so I think with China bringing all that capital or that financing and all that infrastructure development capability in expertise and know-how if they were able to also create training and more sustainable in a capability human capital development then China would have done a lot more for those nations and and probably something that they want to the thing about right I mean there's no winner on the trade war as we all know that right so there's no winner in a trade war so that's probably a political truth right but but ASEAN could potentially be a net benefactor of this particular tree wall because the Chinese goods going to the US and going to other parts of the world is going to face a lot of tariffs impediments so they have to will actually shift some of the manufacturing capability and where else can I go to and it must come to us young in Southeast Asia right so once FBI's move into ASEAN nations in addition to infrastructure financing infrastructure development capability then we are going to begin to see real genuine jobs not going to be created in Southeast Asia and when that happens China may just succeed in endearing itself in other countries over here and I think we must not look well that's a possibility I just want to add a little bit one counterpoint to that is I mean I think you know we often talk about Belton Road initiative as being entirely state focused and so we recently just did a piece of research looking at Chinese engagement in Africa Zoey and because unfortunately the numbers are really horrible so the actual you know in data that you can get on foreign investment is contradictory at best usually completely different anyway - long story short we went around we knocked on doors and what we found is that 80% of the Chinese firms that were investing across the eight countries that we looked at were private firms and there's a 20% were state 80% were private and fifty percent of the investment was state and fifty percent of the investment was private reflecting the more capital-intensive nature of the of the state firms but the the more employment intensive nature of the of the local four of the private firms and the private firms when we asked them you know we looked at their employment they and we interviewed over a thousand firms was they have 80% local employment because it's extremely expensive to ship a Chinese manager from China to Kenya or Tanzania or you know certainly a Chinese worker it'd be far too expensive now Chinese management was actually 50/50 so but Chinese worker though is 2080 versus local so I think that we may be you know missing the bigger point of the belton Road initiative which is simply an avenue for Chinese private entrepreneurs to go forth and conquer under the flag perhaps of China but ultimately on their own and as we know the Chinese entrepreneur is an entirely market driven creature who has an expectation of a very quick payback and a long-term business opportunity so I think that's I just wanted to add that so there's there's two sides to this belton road thank you Jonathan it there's a few other areas I want to explore I certainly want to explore in a moment Frances your involvement in a Bri project in Jordan and Jonathan I might come back to you for some environmental kind of perspectives but going back to you or the you know we talked about services and we talked about skills and education and as I understand that the the relationship between China and Thailand doesn't have a kind of education component to it and so we're starting to see the kind of exporting of services have you see that plan out in the future you know I think that circles back to a point Jonathan made earlier which is what's the economic relationship between China and Southeast Asia or more precisely what are the benefits one is the you know parts of the production chain and as China's value-added goes up and labor becomes expensive you see the lower end stuff going to Vietnam etc but the other thing we've seen more recently is with the rise of China's middle class China is becoming a big service importing country the the logic it's a little bit funny here but when Chinese folks go abroad China's importing tourism services and the recipient country is exporting the tourism services same for education when Chinese students go abroad to study China's importing education services and the US or the UK Australia whoever is exporting but in the particular case of Thailand this is clearly not limited to Thailand because Korea and others in the region are seeing this as well a big wave of Chinese tourists are going in there and all of a sudden in Thailand's services account their services exports are exploding and if you line up all the countries globally and ask which one has had the biggest increase you know relative to their own GDP in terms of tourism services exports to China it's actually Thailand so another wave we tend to think about the links between Southeast Asia and China in terms of production but I think this new this kind of new wave of China's rising middle class and you know the footprint of that globally we're gonna see more of that as well it's been a huge beneficiary to cha Thailand but again you know Vietnam Singapore everyone in the region I think is benefiting from me before we move and I do feel like we should talk a little bit about the environmental impact and Jonathan do you want to give your views on that well I mean I I think as I said the you know the impact of this has been first of all greater khan activity and improving quality of life there based on that so the economic development and urbanization story you know with that there's the externality of the environment and clearly there have been some pretty significant cases whether it's hydro dams and Myanmar or coal-fired power plants and in Indonesia where people would say well we could have done it better and and I think that the Chinese government has for its part you know acknowledged that in many ways and is starting to address it through first of all its own policies through the China Development Bank and how would think how it does an environmental review and and condition applies conditionality to its projects but also importantly through these new institutions the Asian infrastructure investment bank and the new Development Bank's that these are genuinely global institutions if you talk to them you will find most of the people in there come from EBRD or world bank and so they are they're very clear that this is intended to provide a new set of standards and that the challenge they have is that there isn't actually any global standard on so it sustained what defines sustainable infrastructure there isn't there are competing definitions at best and I think that would be great for us to you know tackle that as a as a private sector community particularly around infrastructure finance that we could actually be transparent about what is sustainable and how it's affecting the environment and that that would help us but you know I think the intent is is increasingly there and I the problems that you mentioned actually the fishing problem is greater the plastics problem is great because this is clearly a China problem I mean China is the world's largest producer of plastic anything and so if it's winding up into fish at some point it came out of a Chinese factory and so how do we manage that that supply chain so I think that is that would be a classic opportunity for China and the world to engage on a longer-term basis for sustainability where the private sector is obviously involved those fishing fleets are our private those are individuals who are out there France's money oil companies it's involved in a Bri project in in Jordan so you've got first experience and anything you can share with us yes I think for example that Jordan Bri project actually makes children the first time in a history energy independent I like that at least for years they have not been able that there will reverse the balance sheet in a stronger way etc I like the stability that Jordan plays in their role in Middle East and if we can give quality energy and a competitive price they'll be fantastic this is a case of the Chinese again I think if you expose the Chinese to international standards of scrutiny and business we don't do any otherwise right here so if we made all the banks and the covenants of every bank and investment houses like the mossack types if you meet that kind of scrutiny they invest properly and they pay the right price not overpay and they take the long term view all right and then the Exim Bank finances it not not exorbitantly we wouldn't allow that I mean at the right price so these are good examples so you shouldn't put the throw the baby out of bathwater for every bad Chinese project there are good Chinese projects and until to make a point there's another project which I have done with that the Chinese actually wanted in Malaysia about eight billion nine billion for sharing it and they couldn't do it they were yet caught the contract they find that the price that they tended for like you say the Chinese are too expensive so I was a subcontractor I said I could be the do the job main contractor I'll give you a profit so they take the short term profits well they say yes okay you do that job there's no risk and they got a profit so they are pretty pragmatic like you say it's not they're learning the Chinese are learning how to how to play in the world stage with global standards with copper companies that are listed visually very visible and transparent in all exchanges I think that's good that's good so I think there is progress in that area in the Bri so I would love people not to just knock it but just to make sure and encourage them they're a bit more transparent and because like I say this attempts the size of the Marshall Plan and infrastructure is always good but he'll have to build the infrastructure to parity in other words every utility you build all roads and ports have to be price to parity to the ability of the country's people to afford it otherwise you'll be lazy corruption laced with a lot of cost that people cannot afford then it smacks of corruption and then he gives it a bad name but if you let like I said transparent regulatory framework everybody in the world that knows how to do infrastructure and financing can play the game then becomes transparent said the brim frame were like Britain Britain allows people like me to own their we're sex water in UK they don't care the British don't care who owns the strategy utilities including power in green nuclear power they allow the Chinese to own a stick as long as you play ball there is a regulatory framework you're the licensing agreement is that you provide fantastic quality at competitive prices that don't give a political headache to the political masters long-term investors fine anybody in the world can come and play and and invest in the UK why can't we repeat that Thank You Francis um I'm gonna try and close it off I said at the very beginning how sure there is in who concerned response may be and there's been a lot of discussions about how the US should response to the Bri you know how should they be involved in development in the region I know I asked in either Paul or Robin maybe to give their views in a map but before I when preparing for the pan or I googled Jonathan and there's the all these great youtubes on Jonathan about digital so I can recommend those so and Europe so that means you're a certainty for my question on the Silk Road and the digital Silk Road which is Xi Jinping talked about about you know building this digital community or I think he's his vice ministers comment a community of common destiny in cyberspace so your thoughts on the build out of the digital Silk Road well that sounds very poetic I was just with Leo Titian and the three-body problem he has a different view of the Harmonia cyberspace but so no I digital infrastructure first of all is still infrastructure and so I think we sort of can't over expect miracles if we don't build the actual physical reality of it all that's the digital isn't going to particularly help so digital infrastructure essentially is the applied intelligence in the network that allows you to optimize to that physical infrastructure to make better decisions about its planning and it's done its use but it doesn't substitute for it so I think that's the first thing so then sort of again we're still we have to start where we start but that said of course digital infrastructure then does allow us to disintermediate disaggregate and dematerialize a fair portion of the economy leads to better decisions so we'd get the customer gets what it wants and it gets to share the asset more efficiently and at the end of the day it supports the development of the services economy too and create more value added so all of that I think is is what we see as you know what China has discovered through its massification in China has invented this this massification ideas this development of physical infrastructure at scale across the entire economy and once that's in place then we can go ahead and we have this plethora of data to use it more efficiently and the good news for that of course is that we have hundreds of millions of more people who are coming into the system and so it all it all reinforces itself that's kind of how that scale then presumably can also be you know supported in in in Southeast Asia at least do see a an extension and of course of many of the Chinese technology platforms into Southeast Asia but and with much success and some failures but I think the again it's incumbent on the countries and the companies that receive this infrastructure to figure out how to use it and to decide essentially what the rules of the game are and that's very important that every society and every we think digital has a huge opportunity for impact in Southeast Asia that it will be one of the three drivers of growth for the for the region but it is incumbent on the region to develop the skills to use that infrastructure like quickly gentlemen to applaud the googles and the Facebook's of the world they're actually leading the data world by actually also insisting what whatever electricity they use would be green for example these are examples what business all of us can do that and insist if everybody insists the government will have to follow for example these are good stuff that we should emulate what I thought you should be encouraged now I do what do you want to do both US trade relations where us-china trade tensions and I do want to have some opportunity for questions from the floor so I touch on an earlier I don't know Paul maybe do you have a quick response of what the US response to Bri should be what should their development policy be yeah response is probably the wrong word right it's a Chinese project it's a Chinese Eurasia's China's neighborhood I think the point made earlier is the right one is to one make sure we're winning hearts and minds and not just building infrastructure right it has to capture both the imagination and deliver the goods to the local populations and also the transparency some of these recent you know disputes about debt whether it was Pakistan Sri Lanka whatever the terms of the deals aren't disclosed and it's just kind of a bad example of kind of going out to the world and try to do something that I think is fundamentally good so I think the US bilateral bilaterally or perhaps through the IMF and others can just push China and everyone to just disclose the terms of these things to make sure the debts transparent the terms are transparent the pricing is transparent and that's gonna make the whole thing better and if it looks like it's this kind of cloak-and-dagger under-the-table stuff I think it just arouses suspicions and then we get these kind of probably overblown conflicts in some area but I think that's the path the path is transparency and winning the local hearts and minds that's probably the best strategy for the u.s. welco if I may just take our minds outside of the problems and negativity so of it I think the opportunity of PRI for China is strategic China has an opportunity to develop to evolve an international framework of governance in which that China can demonstrate that it respects and braces international law values Co prosperity and progress right now in addition to what we might perceive it to be a China's attempt to create a Chinese the economy is outside of China but if it's good for everybody then maybe there's married is a great opportunity of China to demonstrate that they can do that right a China suffers I think in terms of perception of intention in this part of the world it does not have sufficient influence over the global media and that's just a disadvantage they have to live with I think for the u.s. is not so much a PRI is that there's a missed opportunity for the US and that was the trans-pacific partnership the TPP was an attempt to bring about a much higher set of standards for global trade in which US can play a pivotal role and fairer trade would also mean sorry free trade would also higher standard a free trade will also mean fair and fair trade right so that is unfortunately not to be so for the US if I can make a pitch here would be sooner you guys come back to the table and to be part of the TPP negotiation the better it is for the US for region for ASEAN and for all of us and bring China to the table as well sort of collectively we can all rise up to a higher set of standards thank you Robin well this there's still a term from mr. milk and I'm gonna have a lightning lightning round on the us-china tensions so we can we can open to the floor for questions and be the what what you think it may mean for global supply chains or what does it mean in terms of the relationship between China Southeast Asia and the u.s. maybe just limited to maybe a minute or so pour your thoughts just on us-china trade what just to current trade tensions heading um yeah I would like to see the debate move away from trade I think the big issue between the US and China is not trade it is intellectual property its level playing field for both firms and its bilateral investment opportunities so the two biggest economies in the world are gonna have to learn to live with each other I think having a squabble over trade which in my view is a secondary issue is not the right way to go I'm hoping we're going back to some sort of strategic economic dialogue like we had 10 years ago and talk about these broader and in my view more important issues Robin I I agree with that entirely I think what we have is nothing it's not happening in the short term ultimately you were tasty Jinping and Donald Trump to sit down and settle a deal they can then go back to their own people and say that I did it and that's not going to happen before the midterm that's not gonna happen any the ASEAN meeting because president Romney has really said that he's not coming there's an opportunity in Argentina hopefully something could happen over there I cannot be too optimistic but the idea would be that unless the two guys sits down and talk to one another shake hand I decided settle then the trade confrontation clash or war will continue Jonathan well I don't know some folks might have been at the Frank lunches thing this morning and which was enlightening and depressing and equal measures the a and he sort of cast it as being free versus fair trade trade has never been free there's no such thing I mean trade is governed by piles of regulations which would fill this room so you know it's always about the playing field that we've got so I think we do need to adjust the playing field as the as the players get bigger and different but I personally if I have a wish for this is that the belton Road initiative would come to the United States does anybody remember the infrastructure plan I think it went up for debate in the Congress for three days there was a school shooting and it's sink you know and we haven't been back so at the same time I know colleagues who will tell me that China has a multi-billion dollar investment fund ready and available for states and cities the United States to build build bridges and roads so hey if I'm if I must the US mayor and I've got a decaying infrastructure I know where I want to go any closing comments on this okay I think if you had quondam government just announced a couple of days ago they're allowing the world to invest in China and Guangdong Area fantastic tax incentives you can own hundred percent of every AI products a product of the future they are doing this as a response of course to the trade war because they are afraid that people go to Malaysia or Vietnam as cetera cetera but take advantage of that because whether you know you don't know the Pearl River Valley Delta has surpassed Silicon Valley and in terms of the number of Chinese and and other European and Americans working together already you have no idea what they are coming out with for future work from green energy the cars to the amount of products if you go and visit really you will change your mind and I think maybe as I was saying the polar shift people understand what it happens if China controls all the I in the data and 5 G's etc you know ah Hui and all that that's where we got into this necks of politics and geopolitics we shouldn't we should stop that I mean who ever a developed bid America they give us an Internet or China the develop AI with data to another area what is great about it is that the Chinese are moving for their own enlightened self-interest and indirectly for the world when we are there please remember some years are you recently the telecom companies didn't like data because they were producing telephone systems why should they encourage data they don't know how to monetize data all right so there would be a terrible wall if they had the monopoly and didn't won the world to enjoy internet and data so for example that is a bad world but today we've moved the genies out of the bottle nobody can put it back but if we take advantage of what China is trying to do and actually Sanders saying come the world Europe and Asia come to China and develop 100% years so this intellectual property scene is often used against China maybe or maybe not in the past but in future people be stealing from China all right people be worried about India the reverse I would say so let's not actually be taken aback by the headlines which are very negative like I say please please at least don't allow the accident happens which the consequent look at Syria though before and after the war I mean look at it today it can be painful it can be one accident can be very painful for a country in the region No No thank you Frances and absolutely right we've got a couple of minutes left there may be two questions do we have my a microphone a roving mic somewhere think again questions Canada from the audience thank you and here and then one right at the back the gentleman with white shirt what is your prediction for where China versus ASEAN is gonna be ten years from now and what does that mean for the US and the rest of the world a volunteer from the panel China is gonna continue to grow next decade five six ish on average we're going to continue to see Chinese tourists investment lower and manufacturing move into the region I think China by then we'll probably have passed about every with the exception of Singapore every country in the region in terms of sophistication development so we got one more question the gentleman just at the back there with the hand in the air and if you don't mind just directing it if you came to a panelist I don't think it's just a question for the panel is the issue you know should be framed in terms of US or North America fear of emerging China or is it more the nature of a concentration of power and a small group of people combined with economic power I think the way you know Europe in the u.s. from what I can understand is much more about the risk to that kind of concentration of power and a small group of people so I'd like to open that up okay I the world is becoming a dangerous place if you can see the trend of right-wing governments coming in because the leaders cannot provide solutions to meet the people's immediate needs now and if they are not going to if they don't build this infrastructure so for a while you know whether the the we can do quantitative easing the people at the top Wall Street but we are not suffering all of us who are doing well will continue to do well but the politics democracy as it is when people vote with their with their stomach you're gonna be a dangerous place and I think leaders gotta wake up that they gotta fix the infrastructure they've gotta allow it digital structure geopolitics got to take a backseat at this point of time your economic policies got to be quick enough at a piece as a speed of light as all communications and AI are they are actually very dressing people are expecting solutions including their jobs robotics brain and they are not finding good solution not articulating well and finding a quick way as fast as possible that to me worries me and the speed of their realization still playing these war games and geopolitics is pretty we shouldn't buy this kind of thing we should ask them ask all of that give when I'm gonna put up trillion dollars in US infrastructure when is you're gonna put a trillion dollars in the infrastructure I love to see it I love to see South Asia put a trillion dollar in the infrastructure I left to see that when the world would be a much safer place if my may respond to the judgment question earlier on I think every ASEAN nations would want to be don't want to be enemies of China and everybody wants to be friends with America I think every awesome country would like to see in American warships only on a radar was certainly not about binoculars any any final comments well you can always trust an Australian to bring a session to close and the bar opens so that's what I'm gonna do now and I'd like to thank all my panelists and ask you to join me [Applause]"
Jiq0RXm64G4,South Korea Helps Philippine Navy Modernize New Helicopters and Submarines,"South Korea Helps Philippine Navy Modernize New Helicopters and Submarines

One of the Philippines’ closest allies, South Korea, will help the country modernize its defense capability, particularly the acquisition of new helicopters and submarines.

This was confirmed by South Korean Ambassador to the Philippines Han Dong-Man in an exclusive interview over the weekend with the Philippine News Agency (PNA).

“Korea is now looking to provide helicopters, small firearms and eventually submarines, since Korean military gear and arsenal are cost-effective and would contribute to enhancing the defense capability of the Philippines,” Han said.

The Philippines had bought a dozen of brand new FA-50 jetfighters from South Korea for the Philippine Air Force (PAF).

The FA-50s were extensively used during the Marawi siege last year, blasting away ISIS-linked Maute terror group that occupied the southern Philippine city for almost five months before they were crushed by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP).

During the interview, Han said Korea is “very happy to be part of the modernization of the Philippine military by reinforcing the capability of the Air Force.”

“Even President Duterte and Defense Secretary Lorenzana were pleased with the Korean FA-50 fighter planes, which proved to be very effective in fighting terrorists in Marawi last year,” Han said.

“Korea will continue to be part of this modernization program by providing more military equipment,” he added.

Han thanked the Philippines anew for helping South Korea during the Korean War in 1950-1955, when the Philippines sent more than 7,000 combat troops that comprised the Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea (PEFTOK).

“Today’s Korea would not be enjoying peace, democracy, and economic prosperity without the great and noble sacrifice of the Filipino Korean War veterans,” Han pointed out.

“When I met former President Fidel V. Ramos, who is a Korean War veteran, I, on behalf of the Korean people and government, expressed my deep gratitude to all the Korean War veterans as deserve the title of a “hero,” he added.

Han also acknowledged that “after the Korean War, many Filipino engineers and technicians came to Korea to help (build) a gymnasium and government complex, adding that “Koreans cannot forget their contribution in the process of Korean development.” (PNA)",0,[Music] south korea is helping the philippine navy to modernize new helicopters and submarines one of the philippines closest allies south korea will help the country modernize its defense capability particularly the acquisition of new helicopters and submarines this was confirmed by south korean ambassador to the philippines hon dong man in an exclusive interview over the weekend with the philippine news agency pna korea is now looking to provide helicopters small firearms and eventually submarines since korean military gear and arsenal are cost effective and would contribute to enhancing the defense capability of the philippines han said the philippines had bought a dozen of brand new fa-50 jet fighters from south korea for the philippine air force paf the fa-50s were extensively used during the marawi siege last year blasting away isis-linked mount terror group that occupied the southern philippine city for almost five months before they were crushed by the armed forces of the philippines afp and the philippine national police pnp during the interview han said korea is very happy to be part of the modernization of the philippine military by reinforcing the capability of the air force even president duterte and defense secretary lorenzana were pleased with the korean fa-50 fighter planes which proved to be very effective in fighting terrorists in marawi last year han said korea will continue to be part of this modernization program by providing more military equipment he added han thanked the philippines anew for helping south korea during the korean war in 1950 to 1955 when the philippines sent more than 7 000 combat troops that comprised the philippine expeditionary force to korea p-e-f-t-o-k today's korea would not be enjoying peace democracy and economic prosperity without the great and noble sacrifice of the filipino korean war veterans han pointed out when i met former president fidel v ramos who is a korean war veteran i on behalf of the korean people and government expressed my deep gratitude to all the korean war veterans as deserved the title of a hero he added han also acknowledged that after the korean war many filipino engineers and technicians came to korea to help build a gymnasium in government complex adding that koreans cannot forget their contribution in the process of korean development [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so so so so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you

virtual gavel the subcommittee on asia the pacific and nonproliferation will come to order without objection the chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any point and all members will have five days to submit statements extraneous material and questions for the record subject to the length limitation in the rules to insert something into the record please have your staff email the previously mentioned address or contact full committee staff please keep your video function on at all times even when you're not recognized by the chair members are responsible for muting and unmuting themselves and please remember to mute yourself after you finish speaking consistent with remote committee proceedings of hres 8 staff will only meet members and witnesses as appropriate when they are not under recognition to eliminate background noise i see we have a quorum and will now recognize myself for opening remarks and you know as mentioned earlier to the witnesses you know unfortunately we may have votes get called at some point during this hearing in which case we will um take a recess and then reconvene after votes i'd like to thank my chair bill keating and the europe subcommittee staff for partnering with us on this important hearing and welcome our witnesses and members of the public for joining us this afternoon last month um the appcam subcommittee held a hearing on the role of liberal norms and values in your u.s foreign policy or the indo-pacific in that hearing our witnesses reaffirmed the importance of having a positive agenda and redoubling our commitment to the democratic values such as respect for the rule of law for free markets freedom of navigation human rights human dignity that really have been a key source of u.s strength and competitiveness if we think about our history post-world war ii and the transatlantic relationship as we came together and built a strong relationship between the united states and our european allies and and partners we not only created um the most dynamic regions in the world the most innovative regions of the world but we advanced a common set of shared values again values that i just mentioned of democracy values of human dignity values of free market entrepreneurship and competition values that not only served the united also serve the st of the world as we created um a partnership and a relationship that really led one of the most peaceful times in world history but also lifted millions of people around the world out of poverty as we move forward into the 21st century you know we do see threats to to that um liberal competitive democratic order we see the rise of authoritarianism in parts of the world yet many of this was discussed at the recently concluded g7 meetings which also included four additional advanced democracies around the world and as you look at that communique it does recognize the vibrancy of what's happening in the indo-pacific region and the purpose of of this hearing is to talk about how the united states and europe can work together not just to can continue what really has been a thriving partnership um but also to look at the other dynamic um areas of the world in this case particularly the indo-pacific and how we can advance through our partnership and like-minded minded values a set in a construct that will serve us well in the 21st century again building on those values of free markets freedom of navigation competition human dignity and human rights on democracy it's not a given which set of values will prevail in the 21st century but it is incumbent upon us as friends and long-time partners to continue to work together not just on the transatlantic relationship but now on the trans-pacific relationship and how we bring those two partnerships together i also would like to take the opportunity to recognize the work of chairman meeks who's been a leader in supporting the transatlantic partnership on a number of issues including climate change and infrastructure and at this time i'd ask unanimous consent to enter chairmake's june 28th foreign policy op-ed on the build back better world partnership into the record hearing no objections we'll enter that into the record i'm going to keep my comments short so we can actually get to the witnesses and hopefully get to as many members as possible and you know with that i want to recognize um you know my good friend from ohio our ranking member representative steve shabbat for any opening comments he may have thank you mr bear and thank you for the witnesses uh mr chairman the defining story of the 20th century was uh the transatlantic solidarity in the face of existential threats to our most closely held values that was back in the 20th century the wars uh that our democracies fought together and the order that we helped shape in their aftermath uh vanquished the tyrants principally socialist tyrants i would note who sought to create a world in which individual liberties were subjugated to the interests and ideal ideologies of the state a world in which the sovereignty of smaller weaker or just plain unlucky states was trodden on uh by would-be hegemons regardless the 21st century has presented us with a new socialist challenge perhaps of comparable scale xi jinping has emerged as the most power-hungry leader of the prc since mao zedong and uh under his regime the chinese communist party isn't even trying anymore uh its goal of imposing it's it's not it's not making it a secret anymore they're not trying to hide it uh their goal to impose uh their authoritarian model of governance uh on the rest of the world and crush uh the free and open rules-based international order indeed she has advertised the ccp's totalitarian uh ism as a uh quote a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while the ccp's foreign policy chief has publicly ridiculed what he refers to as the so-called international order championed by a few countries in the face of this challenge the united states and europe need to stand together once again to defend the democratic order our parents and grandparents sacrificed so much to defend and while there are reasons to be optimistic much remains to be done this week's announcement of a global grouping of democracies to counter cyber attacks illustrates the advantage that like-minded democracies have over the prc assuming we impose real consequences on the perpetrators of cyber attacks including against uh any in countries that uh condone those cyber attacks um yet there is much more work as i said that we need to do uh and the states couldn't be higher uh on his first foreign trip last month president biden sought to rally our european allies in support of his efforts to confront the ccp we saw a growing recognition of the threat posed by the ccp in the joint statements and communicates that came out of the g7 nato and the us eu summits of course rhetoric is not enough uh commitment uh and concrete action that results in europe charting a tougher more clear-eyed approach towards beijing is what it will take for example the transatlantic alliance must provide a values-driven high standard transparent alternative to the predatory investments offered by the ccp the launch of the u.s initiated buildback better world initiative which could have used i think a better name at the g7 summit to compete with prc's belt and road initiative is a step uh towards such an alternative yet without serious commitments from our european allies this initiative will be ineffectual enabling the ccp to continue buying political influence through investments and trade across the globe unfortunately despite acknowledging the prc as a systematic rival the eu agreed to enter into a new investment agreement with china at the end of last year further tying europe to a regime willing to use any economic link as a tool of coercion retaliatory ccp sanctions on european officials who have criticized the regime's human atrocities uh and biden's trip to europe have thus far failed to convince key european members states to end their support uh for the agreement's ratification um and uh i i really do look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses here today on additional concrete steps that the alliance can take we must work together with our allies across the atlantic to ensure that democracies prevail over the threat posed by the ccp um and so again mr chairman i i appreciate you holding this hearing today and look forward to hearing all the testimony and asking questions thank you and i yield back thank you mr chabot i now yield five minutes to my friend representative bill keating the chair of the subcommittee on europe energy the environment and cyber for any opening comments he may have thank you mr chairman for the first time ever at last month's summit in brussels nato members agree that china's stated ambitions and assertive behavior present systemic challenges to the rules-based order clearly demonstrating the extent of the challenge china poses to the transatlantic alliance but but i believe also it shows and exemplifies the determination of the us and our european allies to rise to this challenge is this determination that inspired chair barra ranking member chabot ranking member fitzpatrick and i'd organize this hearing today where we'll seek to better understand the current state of european engagement with china as well as how we might cooperate more closely in the greater indo-pacific region question how to respond to a rising china has consumed foreign policy debates in recent years but a number of the recent developments bear closer examination economically china has made a concerted effort to expand its global influence through the belt and road initiative in 2020 alone china invested 65 billion dollars in countries around the world and that number is only expected to grow in the coming years many of these investments lack transparency and accountability particularly in the energy and transportation sectors and they're often predatory in nature putting nations around the world into grave financial danger on the military front the people's liberation army has grown increasingly assertive throughout the indo-pacific from border clashes with india to illegal island building in the south china sea to increasing frequent incursions around taiwan china continues its efforts to provoke maritime military conflict the same time china's continued development with nuclear capabilities and military applications for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence remain firmly under wraps this lack of transparency only further fosters distrust we could talk for much of the time that we're allotted today on many of the pitfalls of a rising china but we also need to take action that's why the house foreign affairs committee passed the eagle act out of the markup last week to be voted on the house floor this comprehensive piece of legislation calls for the revitalization of american diplomacy leadership and investments globally in response to the policy changes posed by china fortunately the united states does not stand alone in its concern about these developments in june the leaders of the g7 joined president biden in announcing the buildback better world initiative a project that will advance both infrastructure and democratic development around the world further the european commission is currently drafting a comprehensive indo-pacific strategy one that will encompass trade security climate change mitigation and more finally cooperation is coalition in the indo-pacific as well just last week president biden attended the apac leaders virtual retreat where he discussed ways to unleash the economic power of the region and to deepen u.s economic engagement throughout the indo-pacific including the recently announced build back better world partnership all these developments represent a growing consensus among liberal democracies that countering china's authoritarian model will require a concerted effort on all our parts the question now is how the united states and europe can coordinate and cooperate to maximize the impact of their policies together in the indo-pacific region to answer this critical question my colleagues and i have invited a group of incredibly knowledgeable experts with diverse ranges of professional experiences they include heather conley and matthew goodman both senior vice presidents at the center for strategic and international studies uh the marketer institute of china studies head of china research matt fortune and the hudson institute's peter rough as long-standing experts in the field you'll be able to give us concrete recommendations how the us and eu can bolster cooperation in areas such as infrastructure development security and economic strategy and we thank you all for being here today without a doubt china presents a fundamental challenge on multiple fronts but i'm confident that working together we are more than up to the test history tells us that democracies are strongest when united and they're the weakest when they're dividing countering china and developing a cohesive strategy in the indo-pacific are bipartisan concerns here in the us and in europe and i hope we can use today's hearing to think about how we can bring together our country's policy and present a united front look forward to the testimony and to a productive discussion with all of you and i turn now to ranking member mr fitzpatrick for his opening statement thank you chairman keating also the chairman bera ranking chabot for holding this hearing today and to our panel witnesses for being here uh forging a united coalition with our democratic allies and partners to confront the autocrats in moscow and in beijing as a national security imperative both regimes have engaged in relentless attacks on the rules-based international order our values and our institutions and to deter um aggression from taiwan straight uh to ukraine's shared border with russia the united states will need to enlist the support of our allies only by rallying the transatlantic partnership can we ensure that our democracies went out in today's great power competition so today we will focus on how to build transatlantic unity to counter the greatest threat of our time the chinese communist party uh i was pleased to see uh the emphasis that the president put on this goal during his recent visit to europe uh however that strong uh rhetoric that resulted from the world's leaders uh meeting at the g7 uh nato and the usu summit demonstrated a historic level of convergence uh yet the administration's work is not even close to uh now uh it must ensure that these words and sentiments are followed up with strong action we must begin by acknowledging the strength of the transatlantic relationship for decades our european allies have been our closest partners in addressing shared challenges across the globe the nato alliance in particular has been the cornerstone of an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity and i was encouraged that the final communication of the nato summit this past june identified the chinese communist party as posing quote systemic challenges to euro atlantic security and it asserted that china's uh and this is a quote coercer policies stand in contrast to the fundamental values and shrine in nato's founding treaty this recognition now requires every ally to assume greater responsibility for our collective security and resilience and as such the administration must be willing to insist that our allies across the atlantic meet the defense spending pledge agreed to at the 2014 well summit uh ensure the security of their telecommunications networks the security of the ports and other critical infrastructure and perhaps most significantly address supply chain vulnerabilities we must secure sectors from fundamental and emerging technologies to include ppe pharmaceutical manufacturing and perhaps most importantly semiconductors and i also hope that the administration will continue to robustly support the three seas initiatives following with winnie's decision to exit the ccp's 17 plus one initiative the administration now has a window of opportunity that it must take advantage of to provide key central and eastern european allies and alternatives to the prc's financing and trade through their belt road initiative we must fight back against the ccp's attempts to divide europe and sow discord in the transatlantic alliance at every turn the u.s europe and the free world also share the collective goal of eradicating forced labor around the globe and yet china continues to sponsor such activities in various regions as expressed by this committee earlier this year through house resolution 317 the ccp has committed crimes against humanity and genocide against the leaders you must not be afraid to name chain and sanction any entity that engages with any supply chain compromised by forced labor in genocide moreover despite the growing chinese presence uh in europe in u.s markets reciprocal access has not been graded in chinese markets the ccp has blocked foreign investment in infrastructure technology and the financial services industries while increasing activity in these sectors abroad while the eu china comprehensive agreement on investment seeks to address these issues along with the cct's forced labor practices it falls exceedingly short and i hope that the european parliament continues to block the agreement's ratification that that uh the remaining advocates in europe who believe economic engagement with the prc can transform uh into a responsible stakeholder uh that they will realize that uh this assumption is not only flawed but it's dangerous we must remember that china's intent is not to sell a balanced trade uh relationships across europe rather it's to make the western world into mere consumers and i'm hopeful that the establishment of the eu us trade and technology council if used effectively can provide a needed venue uh through which uh to address uh the points of friction uh the transatlantic relationship that have impeded building a united coalition against the chinese communist party however unless europe is willing to cease targeting u.s technology companies and be more clear-eyed about the threat posed by the chinese communist party's unfair and illegal economic practices and its digital authoritarianism this council could end up being nothing more than a talking shop that achieves little it is my hope that our witnesses today can address what more can be done to transform the strong rhetoric on the threat posed by the ccp in the necessary and united action the time is now to build that unified front mr chairman i yield back thank you mr fitzpatrick um and again i'd like to add my thanks to the witnesses um to um to what mr keating had mentioned and welcome mr matthew goodman from csis is what as well as heather conley from csis dr matt ferchand from the mercator institute and mr peter ref from the hudson institute i want to thank all of you for participating in today's hearing i will now recognize each witness for five minutes and without objection your prepared statements will be made part of the record and again my staff's informed me that mr goodman has a hard stop at 4 p.m this afternoon so we will keep that in mind and with that mr goodman let me call call you for five minutes of your testimony thank you mr chairman and thanks to you and chairman keating and the ranking members for inviting me here today for this opportunity and i apologize about that 4pm hard stop but i'm just unavoidable i'm afraid um in my written statement for the record i offered more detailed thoughts on u.s eu cooperation on china and the indo-pacific here i just want to make one basic point which is that the united states needs a credible and affirmative economic strategy in the indo-pacific region i say that for three reasons first of all because that's where the money is as willie sutton might have said second because we have a critical strategic interest in the indo-pacific that our military presence alone can't address it needs to be complemented with a long-term economic commitment to the region and third because it is in the indo-pacific that economic rules and norms are most fiercely contested and where we have to up our game it's on this it's on this third issue that um i think europe's uh perspective on the region has shifted most um uh increasingly europeans are seeing the indo-pacific not just as a place of economic opportunity but as a theater of what the european commission itself has called systemic rivalry americans and europeans don't agree on everything but there is a growing convergence of views on the shared interests and values we have at stake in the indo-pacific the coordinated statements yesterday on the cyber hacking by china is an example of some of this convergence i believe it was also visible on president biden's recent trip to europe both in the g7 summit in cornwall and in the nato and u.s eu summits let me just single out two promising areas of cooperation from the long list of important issues discussed at those summits first the establishment of u.s eu trade and technology council provides an important platform to align transatlantic views and policies on protecting and promoting critical technologies supply chains and importantly on data governance the rules around data in particular data flows and privacy and security of data are critical and the us and eu need to find common ground in this area and then align with partners in the indo-pacific a second promising area of cooperation from the biden trip was infrastructure as has been mentioned as you know g7 leaders agreed to launch a new build back better world or b3w initiative in essence b3w is about offering a high standard transparent alternative to china's belt and road initiative in meeting the third the 40 trillion dollars plus of needed infrastructure in the developing world the key to this initiative lies in mobilizing the 100 trillion dollars plus of pension and insurance funds and other private capital in g7 countries to invest in infrastructure projects around the world but infrastructure is a difficult business even here in the united states or so i'm told and governments are going to have to put skin in the game if they want to pull private capital in three specific areas where government resources could be usefully directed first project preparation facilities offered by multilateral development banks the ebrd the european bank has a great program for example in this area in project preparation uh but also bilateral agencies like the ustda does this as well this is important to developing a pipeline of so-called bankable projects that private investors will want to put their money in a second area is first loss guarantees and insurance programs offered by mdbs and the u.s development finance corporation to compensate investors if losses exceed a certain level third is capacity building in recipient countries in my written statement i mentioned a promising initiative launched by the trump administration called the transaction advisory fund under which we drop lawyers and aid officials into countries to help them negotiate contracts this is a great idea the amounts of public money to do all these things are not huge certainly not by comparison with china's spending on belton road or with the potential u.s private capital that could be unleashed let me conclude by going back to my first point about a credible economic strategy in the indo-pacific to me credibility depends both on what we have to offer and how we go about offering it honestly the united states has been on the back foot in the indo-pacific since we withdrew from the trans-pacific partnership in 2017. first best in my view would be to get back to something like tpp but if we're not going to do that we need an array of economic policy offerings in infrastructure in clean energy in women's economic empowerment or other issues that resonate in the region as for the how two points here first we need to get some things going quickly to demonstrate our credibility whether pilot infrastructure projects under b3w or docking on to the data governance work that's already underway in the indo-pacific as i suggested in a recent piece that i wrote the other point about the how is that we need to work with allies and partners on all of this the issues are too big and the competition too great to go it alone working with our european partners is a great place to start which is why i welcome the subject of this hearing thank you for your attention and i look forward to the discussion great thank you mr goodman let me now go to um dr matt firchen testimony all right thank you to charizard and keating ranking members chabot and fitzpatrick and to the distinguished members of this both subcommittees for having me here today for this important discussion my comments today will focus on growing interest in europe and indo-pacific region how emerging european indo-pacific strategies factor into europe-china relations more generally and what this all means for u.s europe cooperation on china and in the indo-pacific region first a few words of background on rising european interest in the indo-pacific beginning in 2019 a number of european countries began to issue strategy documents on the importance of the indo-pacific france was the first to issue such a document in 2019 and was then followed by germany and the netherlands in 2020. not to be outdone post brexit uk just this march announced its commitment to a revitalized role in the indo-pacific declaring itself the best european partner for the region on trade security and values back in the eu the french german and dutch indo-pacific policy documents all argued for the importance of a coordinated eu level indo-pacific strategy this push resulted with the european council in april of this year issuing a draft eu strategy for cooperation in the indo-pacific to give you an idea of the aim of the proposed strategy it begins by stating quote the eu should reinforce its strategic focus presence and actions in the indo-pacific with the aim of contributing to the stability security prosperity and sustainable development of the region based on the promotion of democracy rule of law human rights and international law end quote this april policy document does not yet represent the conclusive eu strategy for the indo-pacific and eu officials will potentially finalize their approach this september but the broad outlines are now in place how does this renewed european emphasis on the indo-pacific fit into the broader europe-china relationship and what is the significance for u.s european cooperation on china and in the indo-pacific to answer the first question growing european emphasis in the indo-pacific takes place against the background of a broader rebalancing of europe-china relations since at least 2016 the eu and memory use states have stressed the need to balance the benefits of economic engagement with china against the risks and challenges posed by china's authoritarian trajectory at home and abroad the result was the eu's 2019 three-part formulation of china as a partner competitor and systemic rival a balance that also affects european calculations in the indo-pacific on the other hand as the eu and different countries in europe seek to strike a balance in their relations with china a focus on the indo-pacific underscores the importance of the region beyond just china for example european indo-pacific strategies stress the economic vitality of asean and of eu southeast asia relations japan korea and taiwan also feature prominently in european discussions about options for enhanced supply chain resilience with an eye toward china there is also a strong emphasis on working with like-minded partners in the indo-pacific to strengthen democratic governance the rule of law and defense of human rights on the other hand while china is clearly the elephant in the room in terms of european approaches to the indo-pacific the eu and individual european countries have emphasized that their approach to the region is inclusive rather than exclusive including openness to cooperation with china on certain issues such as climate further eu's indo-pacific framework contrasts the need for cooperation in the indo-pacific against concerns about geopolitical competition in the in the region including u.s china rivalry that threatens to undermine regional security and stability with all this in mind i will conclude with a few recommendations about areas of u.s european cooperation in the indo-pacific and also a caveat about potential friction points issues with the most potential for cooperation include the following first given already increased transatlantic coordination on human rights and values including with respect to xinjiang and hong kong a joint u.s european focus on the indo-pacific could also pave the way for greater coordination on the ongoing political and humanitarian crisis in myanmar for example second in terms of indo-pacific regional stability and security while the uk and france are the two european countries most likely to commit to naval and other traditional security cooperation in the indo-pacific the eu and countries like the netherlands are keen to work with the us and other partners to strengthen maritime rule of law for example as a key pillar in the maintenance of regional stability third there is a growing emphasis on the need for more coordination with the u.s and other countries in the indo-pacific on enhanced supply chain resilience last but definitely not least in the wake of the g7 summit and the proposed build back better world agenda there's momentum for enhanced u.s european cooperation on infrastructure financing construction in the indo-pacific including in the areas of energy and digital infrastructure let me close on a more sobering note about the most important potential stumbling block in u.s european collaboration in the indo-pacific any effort by the u.s to explicitly frame cooperation with european partners in the indo-pacific as part of an anti-china coalition will likely receive a frosty response in europe effective u.s european cooperation in the indo-pacific and on china will require deaf diplomacy and above all a solid understanding of complex realities within the indo-pacific region itself thank you for your time and i look forward to our discussion thank you dr fercher let me now call on miss conley for chairman vera chairman keating ranking member chabot and fitzpatrick thank you so much as well as the distinguished members of both subcommittees for not only the opportunity to speak before you this afternoon but holding this as a joint committee hearing we bureaucratically uh all too often silo our our regional expertise and unfortunately our strategic competitors take full advantage of that our asian experts need greater understanding about european political and economic dynamics and europeanists need a deeper understanding of china's internal and external policies so thank you so much for leading by example and i hope you'll hold more types of these joint committee hearings very briefly i would just like to highlight four strategic and security points gleaned from my written statement first we have a unique opportunity to strategically reposition the atlantic world to meet the china challenge but our allies can't be viewed as burdens to bear but as the unique strategic assets that they present to the united states but harnessing the strategic asset is not going to be easy and most importantly we can't conduct transatlantic business as usual and i think ranking member fitzpatrick noted that for example the trade and technology council council cannot be a talking shop we have to move policies forward the u.s can't inform allies of decisions taken under the guise of consultations we actually have to consult with them transatlantic problems cannot must be solved in a timely way we can't allow problems like the airbus boeing dispute to go on for 17 years we have to address them immediate immediately tough allied love must be administered by the us from time to time to our allies we shouldn't shy away from making tough and difficult points and finally the us must deeply invest diplomatically and economically in europe because a weaker europe will be much more susceptible to chinese and russian influence and unable to support the us in its policy objectives we really have a very unique moment the united states in our national security strategy and global posture review national defense strategies nato's updated strategic concept and the european union's strategic compass all of these strategies must align vis-a-vis china but again let's be very clear this is going to be a very difficult task and in some ways yesterday's unified statements of between the united states nato and the eu on the chinese cyber attack against microsoft's exchange servers is a perfect example of this the u.s statement was very explicit in attributing the attack uh to beijing nato's statement acknowledged that some individual allies had attributed this attack but we're careful to know that the organization uh did not make that attribution and of course the eu state was was even more carefully crafted to note that malicious actors were hacker groups that happened to be conducting those attacks from the territory of china this is not to criticize the importance of yesterday's unified statement but it does underscore uh how painful and slow this process is going to be to reposition our allies for a unified approach to towards china my second point is that the us must be very realistic about what and where our european allies can help uh deliver particularly in the security realm related to china our nato allies can deliver greater security presence in the indo-pacific particularly the united kingdom and france in fact today's announcement that the united kingdom will permanently deploy two royal navy offshore patrol vessels uh in the indo-pacific coupled with its inaugural deployment of hms queen elizabeth carrier strike group in the indo-pacific this fall are really important examples of that contribution yesterday's announcement by by france that it was facilitating a south pacific coast guard network against chinese illegal fishing is another example of important allied contributions nato allies also contribute to the annual rimpac exercises again these are all very important uh demonstrations of allied commitment to greater security in the indo-pacific but i believe it would be an error to push european allies to shift their limited military capability too much to the indo-pacific rather we need to encourage our allies to contribute to press with speed at increasing their readiness and defense capabilities in the euro-atlantic area with some military contributions toward the indo-pacific but equally our european allies must concentrate on chinese presence in europe today and its security implications be that heart or digital infrastructure as well as technology acquisition or threat theft there is important progress happening in europe but it has to go more quickly and the us needs to stand shoulder to shoulder with your europe to ensure that europe is safe from chinese malign influence my third point and this is to reiterate what matt goodman noted the atlantic community must succeed in the innovation and digital competitiveness race again we cannot have business as usual we have to work more closely with europe to ensure that it does not miss the next decade of technological advancement and this is where we are struggling we need a new strategic approach to make sure that europe remains digitally competitive and can make a contributing a contribution uh to emerging technologies finally the thing that i think is most missing uh in in our thought process is that the us and our european allies must be able to simultaneously manage the russia and china challenge set and prepare for more sino-russian dynamic alignment between our two near-peer military competitors this is not the cold war when all geostrategic focus and attention could be devoted to the soviet union and the global spread of communism we must prepare for both strategic competitors to engage in simultaneous and destabilizing behavior against the west this alignment will stress test allied military diplomatic and economic responses and suggest that more joint hearings of this nature must be held to understand how this sino-russian alignment uh can be used against the west thank you again and i look forward to your questions thank you and let me go and call on mr russ for his testimony you very much chairman bera and keating ranking members chabot and fitzpatrick distinguished members of the subcommittees thank you all for the opportunity to appear before you today mr chairman i'd like to supplement my written testimony with just a few additional remarks in the time you've granted me we meet six months almost to the hour that president biden took the oath of office as the 46th president of the united states from his first days in office the president who has long enjoyed a reputation as an atlanticist has prosecuted a full-fledged charm offensive toward europe under the mantra of build back better the biden administration has showered europe with a bevy of diplomatic initiatives and coordination in the process however the biden team must also guard against a conceptual mistake europe has interpreted the president's early embrace to mean that washington's highest priority is transatlantic harmony this perception is especially strong in brussels and berlin the two partners the biden administration has courted most deciduously the result is that neither feels compelled to move significantly beyond their current policy preferences the risk is that transatlantic policy making will be defined by the lowest common denominator of agreement as it stands today a landing zone which may be too modest to tackle the urgent challenges we face the recent experience with the north stream 2 pipeline is merely a harbinger it is an open secret in berlin that the biden administration is unwilling to risk its reset with germany by mobilizing against the project a similar dynamic may undercut the scope of u.s european cooperation on the subject of our hearing today the people's republic of china that we need an ambitious agenda is indisputable the challenge of our time is to defend free and open societies from malicious actors in an era of globalization and by far the most formidable of these threats is the prc china is moving aggressively to assert dominance of the international system in particular it seeks to master the critical technologies that will determine the future balance of power a goal it pursues through theft of intellectual property on a mass scale an unprecedented scale in defiance of global trading rules six months into the biden administration and the u.s has inaugurated working groups under the newly established trade and technology council i like my fellow witnesses and uh as a ranking member fitzpatrick noted welcomed the so-called ttc as a forum for broad-based discussion but the us must accelerate and intensify its work by offering concrete proposals u.s foreign policy is most effective when it drops a firm anchor that pulls partners and allies in its direction far from alienating our allies such leadership drives discussions forward and expands the possibilities for cooperation in that sense and whatever disagreements may arise with europe the u.s should not underestimate its own power of persuasion in goals the clean network alliance of recent years is a great example of this principle today in the area of export controls for example the u.s should consider proposing a robust multilateral export mechanism modeled after the cold war era coordinating committee for multilateral export controls this is an ambitious objective but it should be an american priority given the speed with which china is seeking out western technologies of course china has made clear that it will retaliate against any transatlantic effort to strengthen export controls or for that matter titan investment screening and combat mass cyber theft to cushion the blow of retaliation it is important that the u.s forge as large a zone of free and independent countries that are aligned on china policy as possible in that vein the biden administration must not lose sight of the europe that exists beyond brussels and berlin just recently for example the polish foreign minister registered his disappointment over discovering from the media that the biden administration had waived north stream two sanctions or select north stream two sanctions to counteract the damage the three seas initiative is a worthy project that will strengthen the continent's resilience also against china it deserves the continued support of congress and the administration american leadership of the transatlantic alliance especially if linked to that of our asian allies and i echo heather comedy's point that this subcommittee joint hearing is really an excellent format really unlocks a range of possibilities and strengthens our position toward china by contrast an uninspired agenda that focuses on process as europe hedges towards china will vastly diminish our position in the competition over the future world order to avoid that scenario it's time to turn our newfound harmony into tangible outcomes thank you very much thank you for your testimony um i will now recognize members for five minutes each pursuant to house rules all time yielded is for the purpose of questioning our witnesses because of the full format of this hearing i will recognize members by committee seniority alternating between democrats and republicans if you miss your turn please let our staff know and we will circle back to you if you seek recognition you must unmute your microphone and invest the chair verbally i will start by recognizing myself first off um to the witnesses thank you for recognizing the importance of bringing both the the subcommittee and on european subcommittee on asia to together i think it does really underline um is something that you know in the 20s 20th century we had a transatlantic strategy we had a trans-pacific strategy but one thing we did not do quite effectively was lay out a strategy to bring both together and you know often the chinese will characterize this as well this is an anti-china strategy and you know i know from my perspective i actually see this as an affirmative strategy which affirms as i said before the values that we believe in a free market competition a rules-based order protection of intellectual property um you know competition is fine and none of us fears competition with china but we just see the direction china is going under xi jinping so i think we have to present affirmative set of values again of human dignity and human rights um and i think if we do that we actually present a framework that you know for the countries in the indo-pacific they're not choosing a positive anti-china strategy they're choosing a strategy based on the values that countries like korea um if some of the the the countries in the asean bloc really value um so i i really do think it's imperative for us to to present an alternate strategy um mr um mr good goodman you presented um four areas where you think there's cooperation i'm going to touch on one of them um which you know it was kind of outlined in the build back better world initiative um and that's the infrastructure financing component and i think if i heard the number correctly you said there's about a hundred trillion dollars of pension funding that could be leveraged to help us finance um international projects which would far surpass um what the chinese are putting out there what are the barriers and and things that we would have to address if we wanted to unlock some of the potential of u.s pension funds or even european pension defense to be able to safely finance some of these projects thank you mr chairman great question it's um really a critical one because um our whole sort of model and offering depends on the ability to mobilize uh this private capital it is it is easily over a hundred trillion dollars if you count all uh pension funds um insurance funds long-term um funding or funds that have long-term liabilities they have to pay out over a long period of time they're looking for long-term assets like infrastructure to invest in so in principle it's a great opportunity the problem is again even here in the us or the advanced world infrastructure is a very difficult business it takes longer costs more uh there's you know frankly even corruption and other problems in the advanced world you imagine in the in a lot of the developing world you've got all those problems plus all kinds of legal questions and environmental and social uh challenges and they're just not enough um clearly identifiable opportunities and and so-called bankable projects that's a term that's become kind of a cliche but it's it's an important term in the sense of you know there need to be projects out there that private capital wants to go into so i think that's why i think project preparation trying to identify potential projects and help lay the groundwork is a really good place to start that does require some money um not a lot but you know we need to do that through our own bilateral mechanisms like the dfc the ustda and then also um through multilateral development banks and then as i say guarantees other sort of risk mitigants that make private capital feel that there's government skin in the game and that they won't take all the losses if a project doesn't work out is important and as i say this this critical issue capacity building is the last point i'll make which feeds back to your point about what we're offering that's appealing um i really think you know i was in a southeast asian country a couple of years ago and i met with the sort of senior person in charge of their kind of development and invest internal inbound investment strategy and we talked quite frankly about chinese offerings in belton road and other ways and this person said look we don't want that stuff we know what it comes with but uh you guys aren't offering anything you know if you if you came forward with some actual um money but also you know the capacity to help us um uh build better uh projects um with the rule of law with good uh support mechanisms around the the infrastructure then we'll buy american stuff any day so i think that's the key it does require putting some money on the table great thank you thank you for that answer so let me go ahead and um recognize the the ranking member of the asia subcommittee mr chabot uh thank you mr chairman um mr rao i'll go to go to you first here if i can the biden administration has prioritized revitalizing uh the transatlantic alliance uh and reassuring europe that uh as they like to say america is back um my concern is that this is just talk um and that it's not clear what we're uh getting in return uh so a couple questions first thus far what tangible return on these efforts have we seen and do you believe the biden administration is prepared to have the difficult but necessary conversations about for example the europeans actually meeting their uh two percent obligations under uh the their nato commitment and in increasing uh their military expenditures and uh uh so let's we'll leave it there at this point how would you respond to those questions well thank you uh thank you congressman let me perhaps just begin with uh with the last the last point on on nato a third of nate now meets its wales pledge of spending two percent of um of their gdp on on defense france and norway just crossed that threshold which is a welcome development but more needs to be done um more progress needs to be made in this domain and it does connect to the asia pacific region in the event of of of combat in asia pacific if there is for example a war over taiwan the real question is whether or not the united states navy at a level of 290 ships or so would be able to both supply the asia pacific and ferry troops across the atlantic if simultaneously uh there was a crisis of sorts in europe so um this is not a question of of of american harmony of american willpower it's a real question of american capabilities and whether or not they are not strained and so europe has to pick up on the slack and i think urgently making that case is is hugely important on on the subject of of of transatlantic coordination i think there have been a few positive examples on for example belarus where the united states has worked well um with the europeans on on coordinating statements there have been a bevy of releases including the microsoft hack that was just raised but on the major fundamental questions that are still outstanding on the big transatlantic sort of existential questions we still need progress and we'll see what the administration produces in the coming months and years thank you i'll stick with you uh mr route um i'm one of the founders of the congressional taiwan caucus one of the co-chairs currently of it uh so i'd like to ask you about europe's uh position on on taiwan um in a first uh this year the g7 communique uh underscored quote the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait uh unquote in your opinion what more should the transatlantic alliance do to counter the prc's growing diplomatic and military uh pressure against taiwan well heather conley has already outlined a few of the deployments that are that are ongoing which i do think are helpful beyond that i think developing a common strategic picture is useful and the us can do that by facilitating connections between our european allies and those frontline states who have really felt the brunt of chinese aggression and ruthlessness of nate of late the united kingdom for example um uh in the wake of the uh of the of the aggressive um real erasure of freedom in hong kong and subsequently the moves against australia on the trade front has toughened its line given its natural historic links to both of those areas on china and i think the more that we can connect up on the ministerial level for example two plus two of defense and foreign ministers of our asian allies australia and japan in particular and our european partners that would be helpful but principally this is really an american sphere of military action um and and what i would like to see is for the europeans to alleviate american pressure in the asia pacific by having a solid presence in the mediterranean in the north atlantic perhaps east of suez in the north indian ocean okay thank you only squeeze one more question and the previous administration's efforts to counter uh the chinese telecommunications firm huawei uh including through the clean network initiative were quite successful do you assess that the administration is building uh on this progress to ensure the safety of telecommunications networks uh in europe uh i think that's a that's an that's an open question clearly um there's bipartisan agreement on the importance of of keeping 5g clean on keeping next generation telecoms amongst our allies um clean um and so in that sense i would say yes beyond that though i think we really need to push for and address um how we can extricate ourselves from supply vulnerabilities um by providing alternatives and here um you know there's questions about where strategy is going are we and the europeans separately going to pursue a form of industrial strategy for example on next generation technologies or can we work together as we did in decades past through basic research funding perhaps relaxing some competition rules and thereby generating some consortiums of transatlantic private sector companies to push forward the frontiers of semiconductors for example and then it will be easier for our allies to feel uh less the sway or less the pressure of of the chinese so i'd say um the jury's still out but um but i'm hopeful thank you my times expired mr chairman you're back great thank you mr travis let me go and recognize the chairman of the europe subcommittee mr keating thank you mr chairman uh i want to uh follow up on mr conley's testimony uh where she cited the china-russia relationship it's surprising to many people over the last few years myself included the level of uh cooperation with china and russia really reaching unprecedented highs president xi jinping and uh putin have both praised the comprehensive partnership and strategic i'm sorry strategic cooperation between the two countries and the leaders for both governments have recently underscored the steady development of these ties taking them further uh and there are many fronts if you could first miss connolly and then anyone else that might want to jump in uh just detail uh some of the key areas of cooperation strategically and and where we should be the most concerned number two let's still remember there are differences maybe you want to cite if you could some of those differences and how it could be problematic for the two countries going forward and three actually citing a great example of how to counter this the programs like the three c's initiative where it's already launched to respond to chinese economic influence in europe how initiatives like the three c's play into the biden administration's revitalization approach to transatlantic response to china and how can these programs programs like the three c's initiative those type of programs address the russian sino cooperative influence chairman keating thank you so much for that question uh we've actually been very focused on understanding sino-russian military cooperation so i'll speak uh to that but i will say i think the analytical community um had been a little lazy to be honest with you we kept calling this uh dynamic alignment a marriage of convenience that this was something that we historically did not see evolving and i think we have to really now uh begin our assessment with a more enduring alignment this is not an alliance let me be clear but it is an alignment of in interest uh between moscow and beijing and increasingly moscow is looking towards beijing for economic support whether that's arctic energy development uh whether that's looking at technology surveillance we're seeing that growing economic focus uh and then what we're seeing now is a more fruitful partnership so for for the last several years uh beginning uh back in 2018 um the chinese military and russian military exercise annually and russia's annually annual military exercises we've seen naval uh interaction and exercising well before 2015 as far as field as the russian far east the eastern mediterranean and the baltic sea uh we're increasingly seeing uh arms transfers uh between uh russian arms sales to china but as china uh is is seeking the more sophisticated military equipment uh you know they are now acquiring greater russian military technology watching air exercises between russia and china in the indo-pacific is another example of this growing flexible dynamic militarily and that's something we really do need to understand particularly in a two-front conflict if you will so a scenario where russia begins to exert pressure in northern europe militarily china simultaneously exerts even more pressure uh on taiwan and the taiwan straits that would pose an enormous challenge to to our allies so keeping that focus militarily um what we are seeing though as russia and china interact globally so serbia is a perfect example even in uh in the sahel in africa we're seeing compartmentalization meaning that they do stay out of each other's way but increasingly i think that's going to be a more challenge particularly as china grows its economic role in these countries and russia is unable uh to to maintain a stronger economic relationship but russia may have different uh in influence touch points if you will um will we see some friction uh as russia is challenged in its traditional clients uh with because of chinese largesse so we are seeing that compartmentalization and finally sort of thoughts on the three c's initiative and i think this is where quite frankly whether it's uh chinese malign economic influence or russian malign economic influence both thrive on lack of strong institutions norms transparency strong voice for civil society and organizations um so and in some ways it just to hearken back to what a previous panelist said we can't continually harp that this is an anti-china dimension we have to start talking about these plans as strengthening the west strengthening this atlantic world and we do that by quality infrastructure that respects environmental protections and norms does not uh go into the pockets of of cronies and political parties and leaders that we are showing that quality is so much better than short fixed quantity that's a difficult uh process but that's where that deep diplomatic and economic engagement is vital thank you great let me go and recognize my good friend from the state of illinois mr kitzinger hey thank you mr chairman and thank you to all our witnesses for being here i'll just get right to it question for uh mr rogan miss conley as we know the biden administration waived uh congressionally mandated sanctions on the russian malign influence project that we know is nordstrom 2. let me ask you both and i guess i'll start with mr rogue first do you believe that the administration did this with the hopes that germany was of course the main beneficiary of the completed pipeline would cooperate and pushing back against the ccp and if you do believe that let me ask if we've seen any uh stronger take by by berlin from that uh i do think that that's part of the calculation um the biden's team's thinking uh if i could summarize it perhaps in some accrued terms if there's a form of almost kissing jerry and triangulation in europe they want to pull the germans a bit away from the french idea of strategic autonomy and then in the broader international arena whole europe led by germany um away from china and so i do think that that was a part of the rationale i'm not sure why we had to link china policy to to nordstrom 2 and europe this to strike me as unrelated and quite frankly the europeans complained about linkage extensively during the trump years yet here um apparently we are we are exercising that we also i think had a rather disappointing visit of the chancellor to washington there was a lot of talk leading up to that she came of course just a few days ago that there would be an agreement on nordstrom 2 some sort of managed some sort of managed a process but in the end nothing was really delivered and i'm not sure what the europeans can deliver on that um um to um uh to assuage or the germans could deliver to swage the concern of the eastern europeans one last point on the transit fees on north stream through ukraine run about 2.5 billion a year um the three season initiative the major sort of crown jewel funding apparatus for that announced at the munich security conference in february of 2020 is a one billion dollar american commitment so you can see how there's a bit of a gap between both the ambitions and the scope and size of three c's even if it's built out and what just in purely commercial terms on the transit fees mean for the ukraine to say nothing of the geopolitical impact that uh that this decision will ultimately have thank you mr conley yes i believe the biden administration is certainly prioritizing in the first six months um healing and uh our our allied relationships and certainly the german u.s german relationship was severely uh damaged over the last four years but as i said in my opening statement we have to be able to apply what i call tough allied love uh and i believe the biden administration should have continued to press the german government to make make much more significant concessions they are isolated within europe on north stream too um unfortunately this has not stopped them from pursuing this and and i agree with peter that the visit of chancellor merkel was an opportunity for the german government to offer concessions for a pipeline that clearly the bind administration has accepted as as constructed i don't think i would have given up that easily i would have fought until the the very end and it's not because uh we we want to damage or fray uh our relationships because we believe in this relationship and it's so important we have to continue to fight for it i do not believe it was linked to china or to the comprehensive agreement on investment in some ways this is not really about russia per se this is about germany and german policy and how it's going to approach uh uh challenges like russia like china and i think we should have fought a little harder for more i agree and i think too you know it's important to note that we reversed the decision which was the right decision to reverse it we reverse the decision to withdraw troops and i think that's you know to an extent a given as well let me ask you in the minute i have remaining mr goodman talk about supply chain vulnerabilities obviously that was brought to light during the covet pandemic uh in understanding for instance the threat to cut off ppe and the real damage i could do how can we be working with uh the eu to help to counter some of those supply chain issues i know it's only 45 seconds but if you want to top-line it that'd be great well thank you um uh mr congressman that's a really important set of issues around supply chains that as you know the biden administration announced this for this 100-day review one of the issues was the pharmaceutical and medical area and came up with some ideas for how we can make those supply chains more resilient robust also semiconductors batteries and and rare earth minerals all of that is really critically important and we have to do it with all of our allies europe plays a part in uh production of some of the the medical and pharmaceutical products and supplies and i think they need to be very much part of the conversation there is a little bit of a a theme or a sense among some allies that the u.s really wants to do all this at home and understandably we want to do some of it at home but we need to sort of have a bunch of options including production in europe japan other um trusted allies so that's i think the key here agreed thank you and thanks to the witnesses thank you and uh let's try to squeeze one last um round of questions in here and then unfortunately um votes have been called so let's see if we can't get my good friend from rhode island mr cisco with me in here and then we'll recess um while we go about it thank you uh chairman barra and chairman keane for calling us hearing and thank you to our witnesses for joining us today uh once again the united states and its partners and allies in europe have the opportunity to partner to advance the causes of liberty democracy and human rights and the future dictated not by the long reach of authoritarianism and i think to do that we have to be really strategic about our approach to china and the indo-pacific region particularly so my first question is um for you mr goodman or dr fortune we've seen recently a willingness of china to increasingly become more adversarial including in regions traditionally outside their sphere of influence including cuba and my question is should the u.s and europe expect that china will become more involved in regions which they were not normally involved in the past and if so how should we think about working together to really prepare for that kind of involvement um yeah no that's a difficult question uh congressman because um china on the one hand has not um shown historically i mean deeply historically like thousands of years interest in going too far beyond its sort of immediate um uh sphere of influence within the sort of greater asian region some counter examples but in largely part they've been more interested in sort of their position in the asia pacific they are through belton road through um other means in supporting venezuela cuba as you say um they have sort of been reaching out um partly this is because they need resources so venezuela i think was part of that the africa play is a lot of their need to get access directly to uh resources as they see it they think that's an important strategic play the problem for them is that that really extends their vulnerability their risk and they don't have unlike us they don't have a a global footprint of of um uh you know bases and allies and military capabilities and they've gotten themselves in trouble so there's a bit of a i think a shyness too about going too far out on a limb there but they've built a base in djibouti they're uh they're starting to look at extending that capability and and i think that is something that we have to be very alert to um working with allies to ensure that the countries that are being subject influence have again an alternative offering from us that is more appealing than what china's offering [Applause] thank you the pegasus project has revealed the extent in which leaders from around the world installed spying software on the devices of opposition leaders and journalists this includes allegedly prime minister orban of hungary and my question is how does china's use of similar technology technologies influence the global trend of spying on actors unfavorable to certain governments and how can the united states and your partner to push back effectively against the global distribution of similar dangerous technologies that emerge from the indo-pacific region i don't know if anyone has thoughts on that well congressman i'm happy to jump in i i i think and i thank you so much for citing the example of of hungary where we have this is a nato and eu member and ally that is openly courting beijing uh huawei has a technology center there and certainly mr orban has increasingly encouraged chinese investment this is where both the both nato and the eu and the eu us have failed to have a consistent incredible policy to make sure that a nato ally does not continue down this path because other allies seeing that that's a free pass may be tempted we are seeing particularly in non-eu member serbia a strong relationship where we have huawei's safe city pilot projects csis has done extensive research of chinese influence in serbia and across the western balkans this is really problematic because they are showcasing and modeling technologies of surveillance of opposition and civil society which is deeply deeply troubling we need a response for that and as yet the transatlantic community has not effectively responded to that challenge thanks and quickly i just want to raise the issue of human rights obviously the indo-pacific region is open to tremendous opportunities economically diplomatically politically but it's also home to a wide variety of human rights abuses that are really antithetical to the governance models and human rights regimes synonymous with the united states and europe and so how should we think about you know making investments in this region but also trying to advance the issue of human rights and being sure that we're seeing some progress in those key areas at the same time we're making these investments i know that's a complicated question but if anyone has thoughts on that usually like right now well give us some thought and perhaps people can answer that in writing if you have answers because i do think that's one of the great challenges we face great thank you i yield back mr chairman thank you thank you mr sweeney um and knowing that that votes have been called for us i'm going to go ahead and recess this subcommittee and hopefully the witnesses can stay with us again i know we may lose mr mr goodman at 4 o'clock but if the other witnesses can can stay we'll reconvene after our third bed and hopefully it'll be on the shorter end 45 minutes um to maybe an hour so this time the subcommittee will recess so that members can vote the hearing will resume immediately following the last vote the committee will come to order again um before i call on mr perry you know as a testimony to the importance of this subject but also to the witnesses as we were on the floor voting both democratic and republican members came up and talked about how interesting this topic was and how important this topic is and so it's something that you know as the two subcommittees work together you know hugely important for us to bring our allies together across the transatlantic as we address some of the challenges in the trans-pacific indo-pacific region and with that let me recognize my my friend from the great state of pennsylvania mr perry for five minutes of questioning i think my friend mr chairman from the great state of california to the witnesses the threat posed by the people's republic of china represents the foremost existential challenge to the united states europe and the rules-based international order but to me there is a clear lack of consensus on the question and even more so across the atlantic to me it's a sobering indication that the ccp's intention to create division among western allies is actually working china has been able to leverage its investment in europe including through the belt road investments in greece serbia hungary and even italy to weaken the resolve of our eu partners the ccp's outsized influence in the german economy has caused the long-serving chancellor to take a decidedly soft track on china for fear of upsetting bilateral trade and investment relations notably germany is in this position in a large part due to the chancellor's disastrous energy wind rapid decarbonization policy germany's policies left them wholly reliant upon the ccp for the component minerals necessary to make solar panels batteries and windmills as other nations push forward with this technically infeasible net zero policy being discussed on both sides of the atlantic they will suffer the same fate the joint pressure of the economic suicide by the us eu creates an opening for the ccp to effectively take control over critical infrastructure and economic markets and force western leaders to adopt the appeasement strategy pursued by ms merkel recent global summits indicate a shared commitment to freedom of navigation operations in the east and south china seas and an acknowledgement toward condemning human rights abuses however the extent of the u.s eu work against china remains limited to mostly agreeable initiatives in many cases i would argue that these summits revealed many divisions between our nation and europe for evidence look no further than the fact that the word genocide was emitted from the u.s eu joint statement but climate change was mentioned about 20 times to be clear it's great to be able to work with our eu partners on common areas of interest however what the ccp took away from these summits was not a transatlantic commitment to principles undergirding the rules-based international order instead the ccp came away with the understanding that the current administration and eu leaders will sacrifice principle prosperity and security in return for false promises of future chinese emissions reductions these summits also provided confirmation that there is another lack of cooperation in fighting the ccp's outside influence in u.s and eu capital markets and the economies at large there can be zero hope for success in confronting the threat that the ccp poses without a unified effort on both sides of the atlantic to prevent funneling hundreds of billions of dollars into ccp coffers for their military modernization efforts and for continued perpetuation of genocide against minority population and with that mr chairman i request permission to submit for the record a prague security studies institute report without objection thank you according to this report the frankfurt stock exchange is currently allowing ccp companies that engage in intellectual property theft egregious human rights abuses the manufacturing of advanced weapon systems and the militarization of illegally claimed islands in the south china seas to trade on its exchange this report indicates that this single eu stock exchange hosts at least seven ccp companies through primary listing at least 68 via the listing of subsidiary or affiliate this is common practice across europe and unless we hold serious discussions with the our eu partners about the need to deny malign actors capital market access there's absolutely no anti-china strategy that we can come up with that will achieve our political and security objectives none whatsoever to combat this critical issue i will be introducing legislation next thursday that utilizes president biden's eo14032 to support divestment sanctions against pla affiliates as well as any ccp company engaging in genocide or other human rights abuses this bill is set for introduction and because this is such a critically important issue in our existential fight against the ccp i am actively working to engage with my partners on the other side of the island join with me in this bill's introduction it is critically important that our eu partners see this as part as a bipartisan issue here in the united states i'll close by asking our panelists one question do you anticipate substantive cooperation between the us and the eu on combating china's omnipresence in the u.s and eu capital markets and maybe what are the barriers to success if if you don't see us um doing that so that's what i'm primarily interested in is the capital markets the eu and the united states working collaboratively to uh to limit china and i just like your opinion on that and knowing that the gentleman's time has expired if the panelists can give short results all adults quick answers otherwise certainly submit extensive answers in writing mr chairman i'm happy to very quickly answer congressman perry's question um we are actually uh developing a report that looks at the financial gray zone of which russia and chinese malign behavior elicit financing corruption money laundering and use of capital misuse of capital markets is an important part of their economic warfare this is not simply just for china uh but also russia and i think what we've seen is the european union uh with tomorrow i believe coming out with a major anti-money laundering directive the eu understands it has a problem it isn't fast enough in responding to it and quite frankly the us has a strong leadership role to play here so your point is taken and i think this is a huge area not just for china but also for russia if either one of the other witnesses want to respond otherwise i will move on to the next witness so great um thank you mr perry and your time's expired let me let me go and recognize the gentlelady from nevada my good friend was titus thank you very much mr chairman it's been very interesting and enlightening testimony uh i would ask miss conley though to elaborate on her written statements where she says there's a greater chance for strategic cooperation of military assets between the u.s and eu nations within the indo-pacific uh you noted that however that even recently there's been kind of an aversion of certain types of europe by certain types of european countries to upsetting china so i wonder if as we shift our own position in the region with a greater focus on collaboration with australia japan and india if you see any chance that the quad and nato could maybe conduct some joint exercises maybe similar but on a larger scale than the malabar exercises last year and if that's not possible what about working in cooperation between those two groups on certain missions that nato is already engaged in like counterterrorism cyber security and ballistic missile defense uh congressman thank you very much for that question i i think you're absolutely seeing an an evolution of particularly nato allies uh separately uh increasing their force posture in the indo-pacific participating more in exercises and exercises are absolutely critical i think another element is nato is expanding its global partnerships really strengthening its relationship particularly with japan with australia we're also seeing bilateral efforts uh particularly uh the french as well as the british really strengthening their military-to-military relationships with members of the quad i i do not believe the european union and its uh security and defense policies will have much of a posture in the indo-pacific they can however uh again support for coast guard uh ill illegal and unregulated fishing uh maritime issues this is where we really need the european union to to strengthen their resolve on uh the law of the sea international maritime norms and bring that unity to bear i don't believe the eu will really have an expression of a security posture it will look much more towards the south of the mediterranean north africa africa as its most vital security challenge but i do think nato allies can and are playing a more direct role but again we we need them to concentrate uh first and foremost on strengthening the collective defense of the euro atlantic area and then contributing what they can to the indo-pacific region thank you thank you very much i would ask you and any of the other members of the panel if you could just uh comment on the fact that we we know that china is an adversary we know we have to compete with them we don't want them to necessarily be an enemy but what are some areas that we can carve out where we can perhaps work together with some of our allies in specific policy areas if if it's climate change or if it's uh rule of law whatever misconduct you can start of course thank you i want to make sure my other panelist had a chance to to jump in clearly um climate is probably the area that is ripe for uh collaboration but again we have to demand uh transparency i follow very closely the arctic and we have seen certainly a significant uptick in chinese scientific activities as a permanent observer to the arctic council in the arctic this of course this collaboration is is very welcome but there has to be transparency of exactly the kind of science that china is is pursuing that we make sure that we have confidence uh that it is science uh that they are pursuing particularly in remote areas but the chinese you know share with us very clearly um that they are deeply affected by climate change uh if they're willing to take uh policies and approaches that can reduce the admission of greenhouse gases i think we should welcome that and well welcome scientific collaboration but i i think it's very challenging to see china making meaningful uh changes to their current economic model um so i think we have to be very realistic about what we can expect thank you dr virgin you want to weigh in on that yeah i would i would tend to to agree with some of this i think there's a lot of emphasis on in china at least commitments verbally to greening the the belt and road for example and that means reducing coal-fired power plants along countries that are key part of belton road for example in pakistan the real question is what is an alternative there and this taps into some of matt goodman's statements earlier so that's a question of financing and and technology and that might be an alternative to what china has on offer but it also may may uh some opportunities for for collaboration but it requires listening to the demand side especially from countries that are right now taking some of those those deals that china has on offer seems an opportunity for us to do some of that climate financing or at least build it into some of our development policy yeah i would agree thank you i yield back mr chairman thank you let me recognize the gentleman florida did you recognize me mr chairman i didn't hear you i'm sorry yes i did recognize you all right that's that's what i thought it kind of broke up for me i want to thank our witnesses for their testimony i've enjoyed hearing it as well um i was interested by the line of questioning that my colleague miss titus asked and um it kind of my question goes in a similar front you see a lot of reliance by our european allies on china it's increasing on a daily basis um when you look at that and you look at china expanding their role militarily while they still largely in many cases don't even function well as a regional military they're certainly expanding the capabilities to function as a global military and trans-oceanic military as well and my question goes to this when you look at article 5 of nato that states that attack on one member of nato is an attack on all of its members um what do you all opine or if you could all opine on the views among our european allies about uh how strong they consider that article 5 uh statute within that today do you think they're they're viewing that still quite strongly and and if you felt like opining on it as well to even go on to say as we continue to uh try to unbury the origins of covet 19 um if that were to be a purposeful leak from a lab if you would consider that an attack on nato members and whoever wants to start on that it's open i i'm happy to to begin i i believe today the article 5 commitment is very solid and very strong and i it was greatly appreciated that president biden uh reaffirmed that commitment um so i think that we can we can be very assured i think the challenge as you noted is that the uh increased definition and broadening of risks to transatlantic security nato at its most recent summit uh you know enlarged article 5 issues to space and to cyber so we're seeing the security aperture widen i couldn't specifically answer uh you know if in fact the origins of kovat 19 are attributed and clear and what that would mean for nato but i will tell you that at because of u.s leadership we have shifted our european uh allies views on china and in fact chinese behavior has actually facilitated that shift they acknowledge this issue but they do not see it in the security terms that the united states does this is what's going to require long deep conversations investment a lot of encouragement a lot of tough love a lot of pushing european allies in uncomfortable places they don't want to be in the middle of a contest between the united states and china but they aren't on the sidelines they are part of the western community of democracies and we need their support uh in a whole of allied effort against china appreciate your response let me see if any of uh the rest of our panel has anything to offer on that thank you for your thoughtful response sure i'll jump in and say that um virtually any european diplomat or leader one speaks to high ranking official you hear a pretty strong commitment within nato to article five at the same time however you know public opinion within europe is rather varied and i would say that a latino lithuanian looks at the threat of russia very different than a portuguese or spanish citizen who maybe looks more towards the mediterranean and the global south so while there is a very strong elite leadership support for nato polling in the u.s i think is a little bit more robust when it comes to our views of russia and nato as to the cove question i would say that we're unlikely ever to get clarity on that i think that's my speculation and so i'm not sure we'll be able to reach a threshold on origins of covet to where you'd be able to have a real kind of strong kind of european consensus on that issue that's a good that's a good pun well um i i i just think that's probably the nature of this sort of um the sort of the sort of issue um at least how the how the europeans see it and then you know uh one shouldn't forget that um that nato has geographic boundaries under article six of the founding treaty north of the tropic of cancer and so um at least some of the uh zones of dispute where where china is really pushing out aggressively say the south china sea and elsewhere don't follow very specifically within the nato remit a question though um and perhaps this is also somewhat of a punt is how the europeans would react um because i think american expectations would be there in the event of some sort of military emergency in in the asia pacific they are treaty allies of ours they're not neutral as heather comey said and yet that really isn't part of the nato zone well we have five seconds if mr fairchin wants to to chime in just that i think we need just need to be careful to um put too too much hope in the idea that uh sort of a focus on china will sort of save nato i think russia is going to continue to be a greater focus uh especially for for most in in europe and i think the same can be said for the broader transatlantic relationship for all the cooperation that there can and should be on china issues i think that relationship has to be solid on its own terms thank you all great thank you mr madison let me now recognize my good friend from the state of north carolina um miss manning thank you mr chair i want to thank both of our subcommittee chairs and all the witnesses for such an interesting hearing i want to focus um on one specific industry that's been particularly problematic during this pandemic uh and that is semi-conductors my question was going to be from mr goodman but i'll welcome an answer from any of you who would like to speak on this given the importance of semiconductor chips the byte administration is working to increase the resiliency of u.s semiconductor supply chains that has reached agreement with key allies to cooperate on a broader semiconductor strategy can you tell us about what kinds of cooperation are already underway between the u.s and europe on supply chain security and how these initiatives can be further enhanced ms conley you look like you're ready to answer i just have an eager face thank you and unfortunately matt goodman i had to had to leave early um but but absolutely i mean i think this is where certainly some legislation in in congress um thinking about a trusted ally uh approach that we look to our allies as uh important uh additives to the supply chain so the dutch in particular with important semiconductor uh facilities that we work with um our our allies and partners in asia as well to build up resilience provide those alternatives so i think some of that good work is underway i apologize for not knowing the specifics of that but that's the type of allied approach it's not so much that it's against china it is strengthening the west strengthening our ability to produce and be autonomous uh and not rely on anyone's supplier so the the acquisition of the united kingdom's largest semiconductor chip fab by a chinese-backed company has prompted review for national security concerns and has there been a broader trend of prc-backed companies acquiring semiconductor companies throughout europe and of course if so what are the implications we should be worried about well certainly there is an uptick uh in chinese technology acquisition in fact my colleague jim lewis and i just completed a study last fall that looked at chinese tech technology acquisition patterns actually in the nordic states we did not examine the united kingdom in that study um you know it's some of it is it's more difficult to detect some of it is coming through um shell companies uh there is certainly lack of clarity of origin and source of companies i think that's part of making sure we have strong intelligence and understanding what exactly is behind these acquisitions but as you noted the united kingdom certainly uh over the last year and a half has done a 180 on its policy towards china it has extensively reviewed a lot of chinese investment including in nuclear power plants and elsewhere the sensitivity is much higher in europe and that is to be commended the challenge is we have to create those alternatives could u.s investment be that an alternative this is what i mean about turning to allies to seek that that alternative investment rather than china thank you someone else want to jump in sure if i could just if i could just build upon that i think one of the real challenges is these opaque funding mechanisms and vehicles and ambiguous partnerships that have been split up heather mentioned gray zones of finance and responding to the issue of capital markets and that's certainly something that's making it more and more difficult for european allies even if the will is there to identify who the end user and investor is it's part of the reason why i think it's important for the the administration to share civious best practices of course congress passed important legislation in 2018 to expand its jurisdiction we need more best practices um in europe and then also more intelligence sharing and widening uh the information flow to europe on who exactly is acting and in what what capacity um as an example of what i think is is a path forward um europe um uh it seems to be going the way and i mentioned this earlier to congressman but the way of industrial policy something like a half of its 137 critical products in the supply chains have some reliance on china and so they're forging out and pushing out into industrial policy i'm not sure that picking winners and losers like this is going to be the most impressive or effective way forward i'd i'd rather see us really invest in basic research and development um i'd like us to see us push for collaboration across industries and across um the atlantic uh we've done this in the past successfully the dutch company that heather mentioned asml holdings is crucial to the semiconductor supply chain and in the early 1980s it was really researchers in the u.s japan and europe that began working together in a consortium that included intel and two other american ship makers as well as the department of energy labs um all of that i think is an effective way forward and in a way of of providing that alternative along with the investment screening that's absolutely essential great thank you mr fortune a quick question for you you said earlier in your comments that the major eu countries are reevaluating the impact of china the need to balance economic needs with security concerns and geopolitical concerns and you mentioned that any effort to frame this new strategic cooperation as anti-china will receive a frosty reception in the eu so can you can you elaborate on that a little bit i think it's hard enough uh for the eu as the eu to come together on any specific china policies i think you'll see that for example investment screening policies or the eu asia connectivity strategy which are both nominally about china don't really say much about china so it's very difficult to get consensus at the eu level uh on anything related to china especially if it's a strong pushback there's so many different views within the eu so many different structural relationships economically and and otherwise that it's very difficult for the eu to come to an agreement that any kind of policy is going to be focused on china especially if it's in some sense in some sense antagonistic toward china that isn't that they won't adopt certain policies and some that are that are very much in line with u.s interests it's that the framing as overtly against china or adversarial toward china will just not fly thank you and i yield back great thank you let me recognize um my good friend from california congresswoman young kim thank you chairman bera and ranking member shabbat i want to thank all of our witnesses for joining us today and for your patience for staying with us this late you know over the past year we have seen a rising level of concern globally regarding the security of taiwan a potential conflict over taiwan was included in the final documents of the g7 nato and the us eu summits signaling increased transatlantic concern about the threats to peace and stability in the taiwan strait so mr ruff let me post this question to you and i want to follow up on this with a question on where europe stands on taiwan's inclusion in international organizations we have seen taiwan repeatedly muscled out of observer status and many international organizations including who earlier this year i introduced legislation that would direct our state department to push for taiwan's inclusion at the who as an observer which has garnered a widespread bipartisan support with over 120 co-sponsors to date but we recognize that we will need strong buy-in from our european partners as well so where does europe stand on this issue thank you thank you very much for for that question um i would just start by saying that partnering with the europeans and international organizations is going to be essential to um to check china's worst practices when it comes to intellectual property all the way to the activities at the world health organization we've seen i think a pattern of behavior from beijing on say on say 5g technologies where quite a bit has become public about how much pressure is being put on european governments not to kick huawei out of its networks for example taiwan near and dear to the heart and soul of the ccp in beijing is the 5g issue but on steroids and so the pressure that is being put to bear that one hears about anecdotally on on european governments and on european leaders not to raise the taiwan issue that it will have repercussions and market access to china is is very high and so i think while there is increased recognition after the crackdown in hong kong the genocide designation that europe joined in on xinjiang all the way to complete denial of international law in the south china sea or over the sino british 1984 declaration on on hong kong there's recognition that that that the taiwanese especially to the code pandemic have a lot to offer and are a beacon of of democracy and a contrast but their hesitations there and and and and and today the europeans have only been willing to go so far well thank you for that um the next question is you know where the recent nato submits finally communicate laid out the threat the ccp poses to the security of the alliance in the strongest terms to date both german chancellor merkel and french president macron downplayed that issue moreover over nato al other nato allies remain more focused on the threat posed by russia mr raf what does the biden administration need to do to ensure the alliance takes concrete actions to address the threat posed by the ccp rather than just admire the problem in particular how can the biden administration rally the nato allies who do not see the prc as a pressing concern and convince them that we cannot protect our collective security without confronting the prc well for starters the european strategy that was adopted and has been much discussed today of labeling china a partner a competitor and a rival secretary blinken picked that up in his his testimony his hearing before um the center for relations committee uh when he was nominated to become secretary of state and for for us americans we might think of it as we just did in the in the previous colloquy as issue sets so there's partnerships there's areas of competition and this area of rivalry but really uh part of the reason why i think the european union fits this strategy so well is it allows each country to pick whatever designation they want um and and and take it as their own so chancellor merkel has never used the word rival to describe uh china the french were not pleased at the inclusion of taiwan and the nato communique i think that's an open secret at this point and so there are there are different uh there are different attitudes from say the czech republic all the way uh to germany on on taiwan and that variation is there in europe what the biden administration can do is i think first of all ensure that as the us gets tougher on china that europe is not an open open window so if we lock the door but the europeans on investment screening on export is also an area we just spoke about semiconductors where the u.s has leaned on the dutch government to make sure that asml does not export semiconductors um key materials to to mainland china that helped us win the five cheap 5g battle we have we have to make sure that we're robust at home on that and then we have to work together i think to forge the economic future um to make sure that there are alternatives if germany does feel like it's under pressure because volkswagen uh in the first quarter of um of this year uh sales in china rose more than 60 well we want to make sure that over time there are new markets there are alternatives and that a free and open uh environment aligned on china um can serve as an alternative to make it less painful so i would urge us to to move in those directions thank you i could go on but i know my time's up so are you back thank you thank you um let me go and recognize my friend from the great state of pennsylvania um if you want to stick closer to mine um it's um [Music] it's very low so very well great um miss hula our um last member i don't um theresa do we see have any other members on camera no at this time rep houlihan is our last member okay and chrissy do you want to give it one more go at it yeah is this working now or not um theresa can tech raise her volume or to the witnesses can you guys hear miss who i am it's quiet but i can i can make it out i think let's try let's try to make it happen chrissy the floor is yours my question is to all of you all uh how can the united states and europe work better together to reduce our defense foreign earth elements both refinement and practices and which two partners could be amazing i think the question was about rare earth elements in china well i'm happy to just take a quick stab and i think this is where understanding market dominance uh in particular and i again focus on the arctic region and understanding where chinese mining interests were very focused on greenland and the rare earth minerals that that are presented there i think this was a wake-up call for the united states and now the united states is working with the kingdom of denmark to increase its investment opportunities and economic opportunities in greenland at the same time the new greenlandic government has pushed back against some of the chinese mining interests and seeking a different more ecologically friendly economic approach so we see where we are waking up to understanding where these important minerals are and making sure there's diversity of supply which requires the us to engage and at the same time i think responsible home rule governments as well as governmental authorities understand the costs of this type of chinese development so i think there's there's some good news there but we have to remain vigilant and focused the only thing i would add to this is that i think you know the cost environmental social and human cost for china to have this dominance is is high and there's a recognition of that and i think one of the the worries is that as china seeks other markets to develop rare earths then those environmental social and and human costs uh will basically be exported and i think this is a challenge uh for both the us and europe to potentially understand it especially in areas um like like green land i'm not sure if i caught um the full question that it's i think it was about investment in properties in the united states or was it ipr or maybe it was like okay intellectual property again i'm just happy to begin and then to turn to my fellow panelists again i think europe has had an a great wake-up call to chinese ipr theft theft both through espionage but also just through straight acquisition and i think this is where the german government was very very very aware um which i believe it was in 2018 if i have my year correctly of the chinese potential investment into the german company kuka which is their high-end robotics they understood that germany's uh innovative and economic strength was being both was purchased and they also saw a lot of chinese investment in in german universities and research and development that's of course across many excellent european universities and their r d centers so again uh acknowledgment of the problem uh pushing back that investment screening toolkit that the eu and the member states are are working on with different degrees of focus a lot of this is intelligence a lot of this is transparency of who the purchase is but europe is it has awoken to this they are pushing back and certainly the germans uh and the british are a much more cognizant of this but we still have a ways to go well thank you in my view i mean this is um this is a great example of of where we can we can show the europeans that um that the choice between the united states and china if we don't want to frame it that way for a variety of reasons is nonetheless real because um the chinese have perfected this model of of of of acquiring stakes in companies um china's state-owned automaker owns 10 of daimler for example the chinese invited a major japanese and french actors into joint ventures on high-speed rail they acquired the technologies illicitly or illicitly and now both are cut out of the market one can imagine where automobiles are heading the same also i would add on on commercial aviation industries these are the most competitive parts of the european economy where where beijing is uh is is for example purchasing an american french jet engine for their principal new commercial aviation prototype and then presumably extracting a lot of the ip and a lot of the technology and then cutting us uh and others out of the market so uh this is a this is a pattern um that we've seen on on on on the chinese side and uh i think as the european c that there isn't really a choice between the us and china but a choice between having a competitive economy of the future that's allowed to compete in a free and open world or really one that's kind of a sino hierarchy of vassals with the europeans underneath these chinese companies i think as that choice becomes increasingly clear they'll be more and more prone to align with us on a variety of issues great thank you for that and teresa any additional members no sir not at this time okay seeing none um i'll i'll go and make a closing um statement and seeing the the ranking member mr shabadon certainly will give him him an opportunity obviously the um the fact that members came back after votes to to ask questions um suggests that this topic is one of um great interest and um real strategic importance for countries that that share similar values a a rule of law of intellectual property rights that give free markets and maritime security freedom of navigation a respective traditional international rules um human rights et cetera and these are all places where the united states and europe should come together and china will try to say this is about an anti-china strategy in the united states that's trying to be hegemonic here etc but it's not it's about what kind of a future do we want in the 21st century and again fair competition based on a set of rules and norms is fine yeah i don't think we fear the competition with chinese companies or um china's ideas i don't think europe fears that but this is about the values that that bring us together in the transatlantic and increasingly you know with our allies in asia in japan and australia new zealand um korea young budding democracies in the asean nations india as a mature democracy so yeah i look forward to working um together with the ranking member mr chabot on these issues um and certainly with our colleagues on the europe subcommittee not other subcommittees we have to get this right and can't be a democratic or republican strategy it's got to be an american strategy similar to how we work together um in the post-world war ii era during the cold war again on values of principle and ideas and i think that's how we have to approach this yeah we didn't even get into the the arctic council then yeah you know we touched on it but again you know china sits here and says you know you guys can't the south china sea is theirs i just don't see what they're um how they claim territorial rights in the arctic and i don't i also don't think they have those rights in the south china sea either so thank you to the panelists um i think this was a great panel and with that let me turn it over to the ranking member mr chabot for any closing statements you might have thank you mr chairman and i would just say uh ditto to the comments that you uh make in order to be successful uh in our uh to us it probably is more countering uh the prc than it is our allies uh in in europe but uh in order to be successful in our effort to have our principles prevail rather than their principles which is authority authoritarianism and not rule of law and not human rights and on and on we're going to need to work together so we need to make sure that uh our our allies in europe uh are willing to work with us and and i think i think that's certainly possible but many of us really question uh their willingness uh to do some of the things which are going to be necessary for us to be successful uh in this they have to you know in the previous administration talked about this a fair amount that they've been able to be free writers essentially in a lot of this and not i know it was mentioned that well a third of them are now up to their two percent but that means two-thirds of them are not um so they've got a long way to go and yes i hope we can work together but i hope it's not lip service that we're receiving from our allies uh in the future that it's it's a real willingness to do some of the heavy lifting that's going to be necessary if the principles that we all believe in uh are going to prevail in this uh long-term lack of a better term let's say rivalry that we have and that's probably as as nice a word as you can put on it but thank you for holding this uh this hearing i think the witnesses were excellent um and uh i'll yield back thank you to the ranking member and really again want to reiter my thanks to the witnesses certainly for holding on there as we had votes interrupt our are hearing and and for be willing to come back and finish out the hearing um yeah and and with that um the meeting and hearing is now at your virtual gavel coming down thank thank you everyone thank you you
L9wx4GeohiY,Will Duterte's Pro-China Policies Pay Off For The Philippines? | Insight | Full Episode,"In 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte made a dramatic shift in the nation’s foreign policy. He pivoted towards China in the hope of receiving billions of dollars in pledged Chinese investment. Four years on, only a fraction of China’s promised investments has materialised. And today, President Duterte's brazen pro-China stance has triggered a backlash in the country. Many feel that the country has not gained much from its pro-China policy. For example, it lost Scarborough Shoal to China even though the international tribunal in Hague has invalidated Beijing’s claim over the entire South China Sea. Filipino fishermen plying their trade in the shoal are also being harassed by China’s coast guards, fueling discontent about Mr Duterte’s pro-China policy.

Has Mr Duterte made a mistake in its pro-China policy? Will he succumb to domestic criticism and recalibrate his pivot to China policy 4 years on?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",0,[Music] in 2016 philippine president rodrigo duterte made a dramatic shift in the nation's foreign policy he pivoted towards china to receive billions of dollars in pledge of chinese investments he talks about how important china is for economic health in the philippines even though china continues to not deliver in economic goods four years on only a fraction of china's promise investments has materialized they're taking duterte for a right he has done a lot for china and yet what did he get from china in exchange up until today there are practically zero big ticket infrastructure projects by china china is cognizant that duterte is not in office forever they're probably holding some of that money back and thinking we need to keep these as goodies to dangle in front of you know duterte's successor um to try and get leverage over whoever that is preston duterte's brazen pro-china stands has triggered a backlash in the country will he succumb to domestic criticism and recalibrate his foreign policy i don't see him even attempting to cross china china as far as the fed is concerned is a lifeline [Music] he is hugely popular in the philippines ardently loved by his supporters and intensely loathed by his critics i would describe him as a authoritarian populist and someone who comes with a sort of very deeply ingrained ideology and certainly when it comes to the west and the us in particular he has this what you might call a sort of anti-imperialist uh view of the us and the west more broadly and i think that informs his foreign policy i think duterte is a symptom of a fundamental problem in the philippines uh including the fact that we have had dysfunctional democracy we have had presidents one after the other were too much aligned to the united states sometimes at the expense of the philippine interest so in some way he has been a symptom of those deficiencies and in some ways he has tried to be a corrective to that but unfortunately his own gamble has also been a disaster in many ways both for philippine democracy and for the philippines national interest internationally duterte has largely received negative attention he has been accused of ordering indiscriminate extrajudicial killings as part of his war on drugs a cornerstone of his presidency yet domestically he enjoys popular support even in the face of widespread criticism of his pivot to china policy how is duterte so popular and what makes him tick he comes from the slums but he has this kind of hollywood looks uh by some account he's a favorite for the for the presidency in 2022 where he decided to run uh he he is the most influential filipino political figure online so he's being very strong the population is very firmly pro-us the fascinating thing we've seen during duterte's time in office is if you'd like this ability of voters to compartmentalize their their love of duterte on the one hand and their dislike of his pivot to china on the other and if you look at the poll numbers his china policy today has not really affected his overall poll numbers as to the turkish record high popularity rating of 91 percent what has been happening in the philippines really uh with respect to the pandemic no is that people are living under an atmosphere of fear that at any time they could be denied services simply locked down and kept from being supplied uh basic necessities add to that not the impact of the drug war no so many people really are living in their climate of fear duterte's ambitious build build build program is the centerpiece of his administration with china's funding it was set to usher in the golden age of infrastructure in the philippines four years have elapsed since china pledged 24 billion dollars in investment to the philippines 27 deals were signed but very little has materialized what happened to the billions that china promised they're only doing enough in a way to keep duterte happy the 24 billion was the original package less than a billion of that has actually uh come to fruition they're taking duterte for a right he has done a lot for china and yet what did he get from china in exchange up until today there are practically zero big ticket infrastructure projects by china in the implementation phase there are some discussions about a chinese dam project but we don't even know if it will really kick off or how large it's going to be one of the big ticket investments the kaliwa dam project includes a series of dams which have been projected as a solution to manila's water woes the project in its entirety comprises three dams that will serve nearly 20 million people in manila and its surrounding regions it falls under the philippines involvement in china's belt and road initiative duterte's supporters argue that the country needs infrastructure and china has the cash to fund it but why has the project not cut off the ground yet the compliance with all of the safeguards that the philippines has for all of these international development projects things like safeguards against corruption requirements for social acceptability requirements for minimum philippine labor things like that as well as the financial requirements after all the philippines needs these projects to be financially viable not so china has not been able to comply with all of these stringent requirements there are technical bureaucratic constraints on the philippine side that have slowed down projects but you we know that you know japanese in particular and other projects have moved ahead so this is not something that's affecting all projects the other is that china has taken quite a hard negotiating line on these projects by which i mean it is out it is holding out on negotiations on financing costs to make sure that these projects are commercially worthwhile for china to do a part of the kaliwag dam project straddles the boundary of rizal and quezon provinces to the east of manila 44 year old alejandro alex tablo is one of the oldest residents of daraitan village in risa province works as a community mediator and has been residing in this village since 1976. [Music] daraytan is a little piece of heaven at the heart of the nation's longest sierra madre mountain range but a heavy rainfall can spell doom for residents here foreign foreign [Music] the project can damage the environment considerably as the area of construction is deemed a protected area this is one of the most biodiverse areas of the philippines the dam will negatively impact the ecosystem but most importantly it will affect livelihoods [Music] earning around 8 us dollars every weekend it helps her send her 18 year old daughter to school the beautiful tini park river surrounded by lush forests and rock formations is a main tourist attraction with the construction of kaliwan dam this area risks being submerged when that happens melody will be one of the first to lose her [Music] according to activists here disregards the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities the government has been engaging with the indigenous community and seeking their consent to the construction but alex laments that the process is not inclusive one um expected to be completed over five years the construction of the dam and its subsequent operation will require the relocation of over a thousand families living here resulting in severe disruption to their livelihoods [Music] [Music] bye in november 2018 philippine president duterte welcomed his chinese counterpart xi jinping for a state visit in manila philippines this is more than a reciprocal visit it is a story it was the first time from a chinese president in thirteen the years gave new hope that the nation of 106 million will finally receive a massive funding from china worth 24 billion us dollars it was touted as the best option for upgrading the country's crumbling infrastructure but so far only a trickle of that funding has arrived forget about chinese dead trap this is chinese chimera this is an illusion that they have used in order to extract concessions from china so duterte kind of looks like a fool to be honest and that has been used by the defense establishment to say hey we're not getting much love from china the americans they may be imperfect allies but they're the best insurance policy we got so maybe we need to make an adjustment it's now painfully clear that duterte has got nothing for this obsequious foreign policy he hasn't gotten large amounts of trying to aid investment he has cow toweled before the emperor and he's received nothing in exchange for it and that's just bad politically for him or his successor it makes him look objectively weak [Music] the controversial kaliwan dam construction project remains a priority for the duterte administration it has however been stalled by protests from communities that could be potentially affected the head of the daraitan community and a government official feels that caution needs to be exercised foreign he has engaged with the government and relayed the fears of the residents but he's also optimistic that the duterte administration will protect the communities here [Music] the benefits of the dam could outweigh the costs as an activist of the people's network for the environment lyon fights for the rights of the marginalized people the china-backed kaliwa dam that could submerge land and livelihoods may only be a stop-gap solution to manila's water scarcity its impact is far reaching from the ground zero of kaliwadam downstream towards lower land areas in rizal and then further downstream to metro manila are already susceptible to a lot of flood risks so it's basically upon doris box of various threats to the people and to the planet i don't think it's a healthy relationship this relationship between duterte and china it's a very toxic relationship that results in the victimization of the filipino people is located in the ancestral land ancestral domain of the indigenous people for thousands of years they are living in the mountains they depend their livelihood in the poor in the forest and the streams in the rivers of the mountains all this will be eradicated by kaliwadam and what would happen to our indigenous people plenty of them the indigenous people they were saying [Music] if you put up kaliwadam you put death on our people [Music] masali no tena is the leader of the association of indigenous tribes in infanta the dam could displace the tribal community from the ancestral land the government's promise of relocation offers no comfort to him [Music] [Music] foreign for masalino the dam is not just destroying the tribe's ancestral land it's also ruining relationships while chinese loans appear to be attractive experts say that the loans are more expensive with higher interest rates than the ones from japan china has a pattern of funding infrastructure projects in poorer countries in exchange for regional access a trend called debt trap diplomacy the philippines had other options to choose from options that meant less destruction to the environment or people's livelihoods profit is always the bottom line and that's why they choose to pursue the khaliwadan project for instance the japan proposal entails a smaller amount of financing and definitely a restoration of the rainforest and a small projects like microhydro and rainwater harvesting are not going to entail huge amounts of budget of financing we run the risk of giving up all of these resources to china should we default on the loans that we are going to receive from them no and the risks are high the risks of default is high philippines can look elsewhere china should for the philippines and for all um southeast asian states be perhaps a necessary but insufficient part of any development strategy china's aid is not sufficient for all of their needs in most cases chinese aid investment is still not the largest right if you are driving across a bridge in southeast asia or riding on a rail particularly in the philippines it's almost certainly built by the japanese not the chinese the narrative that everything being built in south days being built by china is invented by china because it creates diplomatic benefits for beijing to pretend that it is the economic you know black hole that nobody can escape unlike other loans say from japan or south korea those agreements specifically provide that there would be compliance with our requirements for social actability meaning that the local communities would sign off on these projects as well not just national government but the chinese loan agreement does not provide for that and so i think the intention was to simply go ahead and build these things without regard for its impact on the local communities a large-scale chinese investment is also viewed as a trojan horse in the philippines chinese-owned contractors are required to work on the infrastructure projects rather than supporting local companies and workers thus benefiting china more than the philippines the projects were expected to generate more than 21 000 jobs concerns are growing as this has not materialized chinese nationals have increased their investments in the philippines and some of the investors have to hire their own people you know and if you will look at the numbers it's not very high you know we're talking only about 80 000 to 100 000 chinese nationals getting unemployment permits and even temporary working permits so that's very low compared to the over or labor population of the philippines it's really the chinese companies and workers benefiting not the philippine people and now with the covet 19 crisis and the slowdown in chinese economy i also doubt that china is in a position to throw out money and do all of this white elephant projects it has been doing let's say in pakistan or in malaysia or in african countries in latin america over the past few years has there been consultation in iskaliwadam especially the people involved that will be affected by kaliwada mr president you rule because of the people and you're supposed to rule for the good of the people you promise as president to protect the severity of our country do you think california is protecting our sovereignty for me this is a betrayal of the people betrayal of the trust of the people and betrayal of our constitution [Music] in august 2020 a new territorial spat hit the headlines in the philippines the duterte administration filed a diplomatic protest after chinese forces seized fishing equipment from filipino fishermen in the disputed scarborough shore in the south china sea an area claimed by both the philippines and china we have seen further militarization of the disputes we have seen what i call militiaization of the disputes with china deploying parliamentary forces surrounding and swarming philippine occupied islands like athito island a large island that the philippines has been occupying uh with civilians and military personnel since the 1970s the philippines protested what it called china's continuing illicit issuances of radio challenges to philippine aircraft conducting legitimate regular maritime patrols chinese incursions and military exercises in contested parts of the strategic waterway are seen as provocative not just by the countries in the region but also by the united states and allies the show has become the symbol really of the philippine china maritime disputes and that's because the shoal is so close to manila the impact of the uh taking of the shoal is also in a way much more uh visceral for the public you know it really catches public imagination scarborough shoal is really the last piece of a puzzle for china uh in its quest for taking control of the south china sea and this is another reason why the shoal itself has become a symbol for the philippine china maritime disputes china sees you know historically it was in control essentially about maritime territory that's its view it's famous nine dash lines china wants to return to how it was hundreds of years ago when it was really the dominant force of the of the maritime area linked with that of course is their pride and what they see is their territory for most countries what they want to do is ensure that we maintain freedom of navigation and that no superpower is completely dominant in the south china sea um [Music] a trip to scarborough shoal is something that federico looks forward to it's an area abundant with fish a three-month fishing expedition to the shawl can fetch in nearly three times more income than if you were to fish in the municipal waters of masinlock where he lives but every time he ventures out into the shoal he knows he has to encounter armed chinese coast guards my and they're violating the rights of our fishermen this is a right gross human rights violations not only a violation of our territory and maritime rights i think from a rhetorical standpoint uh it has done its its job and it kept the issue alive and that's why detroit is having a hard time really really he has been having a hard time to give concessions to china including on joint development agreement in areas that fall within the nine dash line now but mobility china's coast guard routinely warns foreign planes and vessels passing through and over international waters after the philippines accused them of illegally seizing fishing equipment china's foreign ministry defended their coast guard and accused the philippines instead of you know things are not improving and as we saw last year an incident happened in the reed bank where um you know 22 philippine fishermen almost drowned and died when a chinese suspected militia vessels just ran into them in the middle of the in the middle of the night so you know that incident really drove home the fact that duterte's china policy has been a massive failure he's not getting any concession from china and china is ramping up its presence in philippine waters the duterte's administration's protests against china also comes against the backdrop of a simmering debate in the philippines over their president's pivot to china policy several top philippine officials have publicly complained about the backlog in promised chinese projects there's also been public pressure to take a tougher stance on china i think duterte is i would say tweaking his foreign policy a few months ago it looked like there was a major recalibration of his shift towards beijing and that he was moving more firmly back towards a sort of pro-us position or at least a more ambiguous position but we're not seeing is duterte totally giving up his pivot to beijing i think ideologically you know duterte is still very pro-beijing pro-moscow he's sort of a cold war ideologue i think that rodrigo duterte is responding to the fact that his china policy has abjectly failed for the last four years four and a half years he is not any more pro-american today than he was when he took office in 2016. i doubt he's any more anti-china but the fact is that he there was an implicit deal between him and china in 2016 that he would push the americans to arms lanes and keep quiet on the south china sea in exchange for money he needed loans investment aid and none of that showed up and so now he realizes that if he keeps this up it only makes him look weak it damages his political brand and it hurts his successor whoever he decides to anoint for the 2022 presidential run the filipino fishing community has expressed concerns that chinese fishermen are engaged in the mass harvesting of precious clams from the philippine claimed scarborough shoal there will be some consequences if china will not pay attention to our sensitivities and to our red lines that's why we are pushing hard for the conclusion of the code of conduct in the south china sea and that is why also we're talking with china bilaterally to have some sort of joint fishery management in the area if not in the whole south china sea area but at least in the scarborough show to be frank i really do not understand this subservience to chinese interest you can assert filipino interests without being subservient to the interest of the chinese in the philippines as president he swear under oath that he should be defending integrity of the philippine territory but i do not see that in the in the issue of the west philippine sea the issues surrounding the south china sea have also contributed to the rise of an anti-china sentiment in the country an ongoing controversy involves a friendship bridge to signify china philippines relations it is being constructed in the historic center of manila city but for the filipinos it's a bridge that's burning bridges we find it superfluous that the government would want to build a bridge in between two bridges [Music] [Music] bridge also called the friendship bridge is at the heart of the historic center of manila it's also at the heart of a heated controversy in the philippines why would you construct another bridge between two bridges when in fact you can retrofit the existing bridges if you want a goods to flow easier why not make the delpan bridge a bit wider so that it could also accommodate these big vans coming from the port area the bridge is a gift to the duterte government to ease manila's traffic congestion heritage conservationists like maria have been opposing the construction built with the 76 million us dollar chinese grant it can threaten their bid to the unesco to make the intramuros area into a world heritage site as a heritage worker it's better to preserve what is existing it's a historic district and many of the structures in the area have been there for centuries so why not preserve this these churches are examples of earthquake baroque churches meaning to say the architecture might be european it might be of baroque architecture but it was constructed to withstand the frequent earthquakes that strike the philippines so it's a showcase of filipino ingenuity there's considerable public resentment against not just the infrastructure projects but also against the growing influx of chinese into the country chinese immigrants including many employees of chinese offshore gambling operations are believed to push up rents and other costs forcing locals out and arousing racial hostility but what continued to hit a raw nerve and inflamed passions at the maritime spats between china and the philippines [Music] is ernesto runs a small fish stall in the coastal town of massenlock fish from scarborough fetch a high price and are in demand when fishermen are banned from going to scarborough sellers like him lose a sizeable chunk of their businesses and therefore incomes president duterte was i think their best shot really at fundamentally reorienting the philippines foreign policy and they didn't give much for duterte to work with and they did so much wrong in south china sea that they really alienated a lot of filipinos the south china sea tension escalated in 2012 when manila took the mata to the permanent court of arbitration in the hague in 2016 the court ruled that china has no legal basis for its sweeping territorial claims over the entirety of the south china sea however president duterte has not enforced the historic ruling [Music] hindi duterte's view on the shoal and other and other south china sea issues is partly driven by other ideology but it's also partly a sort of real politic view i mean his take is that yes this is this is philippine territory but at the end of the day the asymmetry of power between china and the philippines is so great so what does the philippines have to gain by being very very antagonistic to china and his view it's better to try and have warmer relations not let this issue disrupt border bilateral ties and try and boost the economic investment ties foreign the south china sea is of immense strategic and geo-economic importance one-fifth of global trade passes through it china pushes for control of the disputed sea lanes as its economic security is closely tied to the south china sea but china's destructive activities in the region like dredging to construct new islands and overfishing are causing irreparable damage to the environment there are a lot of people who have tried less years to put a number on how much damage china's caused to the marine environment in south tennessee and there was even still ongoing efforts to convince filipinos to sue china for damages based on on a number of things however you slice it the fact is that china has engaged in the largest intentional destruction of coral reef in the history of the world and that it has done it in the world's most productive fishing grounds they're clam digging operations which have been destroying the habitats on scarborough shoal because a chinese fishermen basically excavate coral reefs in order to get valuable giant clam shells which they use as a substitute for ivory you know and it's a very lucrative business uh in china and it's only in china that this has been has become a real economic uh opportunity china has continued to destroy scarborough shoal since 2012 and essentially the government turned a blind eye to this in order to present this atmosphere or friendliness and and congeniality with china i think that has become increasingly untenable so is it time for president duterte to change tech and rethink his china pivot strategy will duterte be compelled by domestic pressures to move closer to the us by recalibrating his friendly relations with china so it has been a shambolic chinese policy by duterte in theory it makes sense for us to play the superpowers against each other and get concessions from both sides most south asian countries have been doing that but that presupposes one thing that presupposes strategic coherence and strategic maturity if not assuredness and that's exactly what we don't see in president duterte i think he has already slightly recalibrated his policy during the pandemic we've noticed that with the you know reversing his early decision to cancel the us security pact visiting forces uh agreement but we've also seen him make comments about you know joint oil and gas exploration with china being positive about that it's hard to say this is a total recalibration if his poll numbers start to dip slightly he will take a more robust position towards china if his poll numbers are high as they are right now then he tends to you know revert to his more a sort of ideological natural position of being very china i think the posturing will continue he really will not be able to convince the people that his china policy has produced tangible benefits at this point that's why he still hoping that china would provide the philippines with free vaccines for kovit19 i think that's his last card that he can play in order to salvage his china policy [Music] you
luTPMHC7zHY,Why China is building islands in the South China Sea,"China claims they aren't military bases, but their actions say otherwise. 

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It’s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world’s fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world’s shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It’s an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country’s EEZ belong to that country; they’re its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it’s shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN’s EEZ laws — except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line’s boundaries and rejecting other countries’ claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They’ve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries’ islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It’s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.

Or on Facebook: http://goo.gl/U2g06o",0,"This is Fiery Cross island. It's a little more than one square mile in size and it's home to a Chinese military base. There's a 10,000 foot airstrip, an advanced radar station, a missile defense system, and about 200 troops. But the strangest thing about Fiery Cross Island is that two years ago, it didn't exist. And neither did the six other Chinese military bases that have been built on man-made islands in the South China Sea. If you look at this satellite image from 2014, you can see huge Chinese ships collecting around remote reefs in the Spratly Islands. An archipelago in the South China Sea. In this image, these ships are rapidly pumping sand and rock up onto the reef. They're building islands. And less than a year later, the Chinese had seaports air bases and buildings on their new islands and the world had taken notice. We continue our look this morning on what China does not want you to see the superpower is reclaiming land in seven spots in the South China Sea adding on average more than three-and-a-half acres everyday. With these islands times trying to lay claim to one of the most important areas of ocean in the world the South China Sea. The South China Sea is incredibly rich in natural resources 11 billion barrels of oil, 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and ten percent of the world's fisheries. Most importantly though, 30% of the world's shipping trade flows through here to the booming population centers and economic markets of Southeast Asia. It's an extremely important body of water and right now five countries lay claim to some part of it. Now, most countries base their claim off the UN Law of the Seas, which says a country's territorial waters extend 200 miles off their shore. An area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Countries have exclusive rights to all the resources and trade in there EEZ. It's their sovereign territory. So for example, any oil that's found within 200 miles off the coast of Vietnam belongs exclusively to Vietnam. But any area that isn't in an EEZ is regarded as international waters and it falls under UN maritime law which means everybody shares it. Now, every country in the South China Sea region uses this 200-mile EEZ threshold to determine its claims. All except China. China argued they have a historical claim to the South China Sea dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. And they mark it using a really confusing border called the nine-dash line. Following World War II, Japan who had dominated the entire region, lost all control of its surrounding seas. China used the moment to claim the South China Sea by drawing this imprecise line on the map that encompassed ninety percent of the South China Sea. It became known as the nine-dash line. When the UN established the 200-mile EEZ in 1973 China stuck to its own line, refusing to clarify its boundaries and ignoring claims by other countries. Now that brings us to the Spratly Islands. It's a remote barely inhabited cluster of islands currently claimed by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The Spratlys are both geographically and symbolically at the heart of South China Sea. That's because any country that can claim the Spratly islands can extend their EEZs to include them and gain exclusive rights to the surrounding territory. But it's really hard to legitimately claim uninhabited piles of sand so a few nations have built small buildings and ports on their claimed islands and even stuck a few people there. But China believes all the Spratly Islands belong to them which brings us back to why they're building islands there. Installing military bases on these new artificial islands took the dispute to a whole new level showing how China's potentially willing to defend its claims with force. Now this is about when the United States took notice. While the US has no claim in the South China Sea, it is the world's lone superpower and uses its massive Navy to defend international waters. China sees the US presence in the area as an encroachment in their backyard. When a US destroyer ship sailed just 12 miles off the shore of one of China's man-made islands and the Spratlys China sent out their own destroyer and a patrol boat as a warning. China is building these islands in order to increase control around the surrounding waters. Using a strategy that they've deemed ""The Cabbage Strategy"". Where they surround a contested island with as many ships as possible. In May of 2013 China sent several ships to Ayungin shoal, which is just 105 nautical miles off the coast of the Philippines, well within that 200 mile EEZ. The Philippines has eight soldiers stationed there. Like wrapping leaves around a cabbage the Chinese sealed off the Philippines access to Ayungin Shoal with fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers creating blockade so that the Filipinos can't receive shipments of food and supplies. By building their own man-made Islands China's essentially building naval bases. The more Islands they have the more ships they can support and more territory they can slowly take control of. And the Chinese cautiously use the cabbage strategy in the Spratly islands, taking over contested territory but in small steps avoiding the possibility of igniting a bigger conflict. But the disputes are intensifying. Countries are now actively arresting trespassers in waters that they claim and China could go a step further. Since 2015 they've threatened to declare an air identification zone above the South China Sea, declaring that all aircraft that fly through it would need Chinese permission. Now, publicly China insists that their intentions are not militaristic but their actions say otherwise and it's heightening tensions in the region Steve Bannon who sits on the US National Security Council and who is one of President Trump's closest advisors is almost certain that the US will go to war in the South China Sea. ""We're going to war in the South China Sea, I was a sailor there, a naval officer, we're going to war the South China Sea in five to ten years aren't we?"" ""there's no doubt about it"" But for now the disputes remain only in the legal and diplomatic realms that only occasionally break into minor clashes. In July 2016 the international court at the Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines who charged China with invading their rightful territory in the South China Sea. China dismissed the ruling and enforcement of the law doesn't seem likely. Even from the US who released a vague statement urging the two countries to ""clarify their claims"" and ""work together to resolve their disputes"" which is another way of saying ""we don't really want to deal with this"". In fact, as the conflict escalates and international courts get involved, the US is stuck in a tricky position. On one hand, they do not want to risk provoking a conflict with China. But on the other they want China to stop bullying their allies in the region. Up until now the US has managed the situation by continuing to patrol through the South China Sea. It's also likely that the US would fly fighter jets above the sea if China actually does declare an air identification zone. These are symbolic but effective ways of keeping Chine in check while not getting too involved in the details of the conflict. So far the disputes in the South China Sea have not become violent but countries are starting to defend their claims by increasing troop numbers, weaponizing their territory and provoking each other. It's a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention for better or for worse."

As the plains of Ukraine turn into a battlefield, few players have more at stake than China. Its “no limits” partner faces stringent Western sanctions and its strategic competitors have found a new resolve. China is faced with a choice between its stated respect for sovereignty and its burgeoning friendship with Moscow. #UkraineCrisis #RussiaUkraineWar #China 

What lessons will China and the world take from the Ukraine conflict? If deterrence hasn’t worked with Moscow, how will it work with Beijing? With the West largely united over Russian sanctions, is the Chinese economic juggernaut likely to face similar pressure in the event of a crisis? WIll China’s lure be able to stand the test of a prolonged association with Moscow?

reinhard butterkoffer member of the european parliament of germany andrew shearer director general office of the national intelligence of australia and gudrun walker senior fellow of the german institute for international and security affairs germany now the world's attention has rightly been focused on ukraine for the past few months but it's the important consequences of that conflict that may well be played out in the indo-pacific as china and the countries of the region absorbed the lessons from the war ukraine has certainly given taiwan a template in resistance and previewed the kinds of weapons the western world is prepared to use to prevent china should it attempt to attack taiwan the long war in ukraine may also once again prove that the west could become distracted away from china just as it did when it was conducting the war on terror post 9 11. i'd like to begin with you admiral can you just tell us what the military implications of ukraine is for the indo-pacific so um good evening yalda and good evening everybody it's um i should say it's a delight to be uh back at the cena dialogue and uh we were joking just beforehand two years ago i was on a on a panel being quizzed by yalda previously and i i'm still back here so um i think there are i think we have to be cautious with the ukraine conflict because it's still ongoing and i think at times there is a rush to to try to come to all kinds of conclusions so some of my conclusions are inevitably quite generic and i think they're they're substantial ones that apply not just to the indo-pacific they actually apply to the whole world and that really is the significance of what's going on the first one would be that strategic errors lead to strategic consequences now that's a kind of a glimpse of the blinding obvious but it's absolutely what is happening in ukraine and what russia has done is a catastrophic era and then that has implications all across the world and it has severe implications for russia i think the second aspect which absolutely applies to to this region and to the indo-pacific is the clarity around that boring phrase of a rules-based international order well actually rules matter and you're seeing that rules matter in the way that the world has responded and that that has real impact on militaries and how they consider the use of force and what the implications are when you use that force and i think at the strategic level what the implications are when you transgress the international rules of the world and then that really leads on to my third point which is the importance of allies and partners and the confidence that we should take that when nations transgress and when the world responds it's the world that is more powerful than individual nations and we should have enormous confidence in the the unity the clarity the power that partners and allies can bring and how that impacts both at the strategic level but at the operational level all the way down to the tactical level and that's what you're seeing in ukraine the pressure on russia in terms of rush the russian state the operational impact in terms of what is happening on the ground in ukraine and the implications for euro-atlantic security and then at the tactical level you're seeing support for ukrainian armed forces you're seeing magnificent uh ukrainian armed forces and their response and then how that impacts back up the chain in terms of russia so there are all kinds of consequences i just want to pick up on that point about alliances and and the kind of um strategic allegiance that the west has shown when it's come to the conflict in ukraine as far as the russians are concerned sure there are sanctions but it hasn't stopped bombs it it hasn't stopped the bombs but i think we have to be really careful of of that kind of approach that says well actually i'm going to look for the nth degree of everything to be uh to be resolved i think sticking still with my this is this is a conflict that is ongoing when russia went into ukraine they were going in to occupy the whole of ukraine they went in with a bogus supposition that they wanted to to respond to uh what they saw as being the threat of of nato they wanted to try and hook it in ukraine and ensure that it couldn't it couldn't travel to the west it couldn't in the future have an aspiration for the eu and and it would deny any aspirations in terms of nato the complete opposite has happened russia has lost the ukrainian population and will they will not they will not be hooked in to russia um they they will look increasingly westwards nato has responded in a magnificent fashion nato is more unified than i've ever known in my whole career and then there's this debate an extraordinary strategic debate about finland and sweden and might they join nato and those those are things that have happened in such a short period of time which ordinarily would have taken years and it's brought nato together but i was just in ukraine admiral and what i continue to hear from the ukrainian people we are grateful and thank you for the military hardware you're supplying us but we feel a sense of abandonment here we've asked for a no-fly zone we've asked for tanks and none of these things have been delivered to us so i i think the the other piece that goes with ukraine and the the response of nato uh and the response of of uh other nations around the world is is an honesty about some of the complexities of the the conflict in ukraine and that is being incredibly honest about ensuring that the response in ukraine doesn't escalate the situation and we acknowledge the seriousness of this and that we don't start to track down a conflict that would involve nato in direct combat operations with russia and that's been a political imperative that has been imposed from the very outset and it and and i can understand the frustrations uh with our ukrainian friends and we deal with with some of those ukrainian generals directly so so but that is that is a constraint that is being applied and is being applied honestly and then to your other point about the support that's been given to ukraine there is an extraordinary level of support that's been given to ukraine and if you if you if you track to what russia is saying there are see you know russia is criticizing the level of support that's been given to ukraine so i think the success of the ukrainian armed forces is again is testament to their own courage to their their ingenuity their political leadership the fact that they're fighting for their country but it also reflects the support that's been given by a whole series of nations if this is a long war and we don't know how long it's going to last two weeks 10 years is that to china's advantage because again the west is distracted from the china question the china issue well i'm i'm conscious of hogging no we've got plenty of time so i i think we've got to be really careful about um these conclusions in terms of china this this is a conflict with russia the uk position is is is very different in our integrated review we declared russia as an acute threat and we made a a clear distinction about the language in terms of china as a competitor and as a challenge i think that the pieces to me for china to absorb and for all of us to absorb again he's going up higher is that this world order these international rules um when you transgress those international rules it leads to all kinds of consequences and when you invoke war war is this ugly unpredictable beast and it leads to again a whole series of other consequences and and and here we are just a couple of months into this at one level relatively contained conflict in eastern europe and yet the global impact whether it's energy prices food prices the sanctions on russia the impact on the world economy as well as that the shocking impact on people in ukraine and displaced people as well as the deaths and destruction are enormous and i think if you're if you're any other nation and you're contemplating the use of force and you're doing that in such a hideous way which is a transgression of international law and is clearly illegitimate then the reaction of the world and the implications and the unpredictability of this that the shocking miscalculation by russia who i i assume um was being told by yeah putin was being told by his generals by his intelligence specialists by his economist that actually you're you've preserved your economy you've got a war chest you can do this you're military saying you can go and do this and we'll we'll do it quickly um the intelligence saying actually we think we've worked it out it's it's back to a truism of of of of war and it's unpredictable nature and that the the the caution that has to be applied when you use force in this manner and especially when you use it in such an illegitimate fashion and i think i think all nations will be absorbing that and it's it's a constraint on how nations will act andrew i'm going to come to the the china challenge again because you're someone who has been a china watcher and focused on the china challenge before it was even fashionable this past month the solomon islands signed a pact with china what's china in my view china's objective is now increasingly clear and that is china wants to be the world's leading power wants to supplant the united states in that in that number one position and on the way to achieving that global objective it needs to establish dominance in in asia in the indo-pacific and to do that it's bringing together all the arms of state parent a very coordinated strategy economic inducements investment the belt and road initiative but it's also using military power cyber power foreign interference in other countries to build out a position of influence right across the region that includes an ambition to establish a network of dual use and military facilities right across the indo-pacific from the west coast of africa into the pacific and our concern about the agreement that was recently signed notwithstanding a lot of concern in the region i was up there just a couple of weeks ago lots of concern in the region about the implications of an increased chinese security and defence presence in the pacific but that agreement has has gone ahead and we we will be watching we will be uh working why did it go ahead i mean was it an intelligence failure on your part um before we came out here i tried to get yalda to go easy on a compatriot as you can tell that didn't work it wasn't an intelligence failure this this strategy has been unfolding for a number of years i think for those of us watching closely uh there were signs of this well over a decade ago and we've seen this building this building presence across the indo-pacific we've seen uh china moving into these security relationships across the pacific in a more active way i think when the pandemic was at its height it was harder in a way for all of us to be to be present in the region as regional countries open up china has exploited the the reopening it's it's very active again it's using all of the uh the considerable instruments of power at its disposal that includes chinese companies state-owned enterprises chinese diplomacy chinese defense attaches the whole panoply of chinese power being being deployed in a targeted way in these very small very fragile very vulnerable countries but it's not like australia didn't have influence over the solomons if you go back way back to the 90s they dealt with the riots and security issues then the australian police have always been involved in providing security that happened again in the early 2000s when we had the the ramsey agreement and and that task force again a few months ago so to say that china is just trying to spread its sphere of influence and putting everything in its power to you know to almost seduce these smaller pacific nations australia has been doing that so what's gone wrong here with this pact why did it go ahead what you say about our contribution in the pacific and particularly in the solomons is very true we've invested uh billions of dollars in in development assistance and security assistance to solomon islands we've got personnel on the ground today as we speak we responded within eight hours of receiving a request from the solomon island government um we we made a decision and we had troops and police on the ground within 24 hours of that could we see chinese troops on the ground in the solomons uh we uh we are already seeing chinese police on the ground in in small numbers and our concern is that this agreement potentially opens the way to a more persistent chinese military presence in solomon islands could that if they if the chinese police are trying to control one part of a town or a village or an area and the australian police are trying to do something else could that put them in direct conflict unity of command is a is a always desirable in any security operation and confusion around unity of command is an issue we are also concerned that in such a fragile volatile country chinese policing techniques and tactics that we've seen deployed so ruthlessly in hong kong for example are completely inconsistent with the pacific way of resolving issues and and could incite further instability and violence in the solomon islands that's one of our biggest concerns so what is it then that china wants china wants a region where countries comply with its strategic preferences and choices and don't make their own choices and that's why our efforts are so directed at helping countries in the pacific and southeast asia and the indo-pacific more broadly defend their own sovereignty and protect their own sovereignty australia's not a perfect partner for these countries we've made a big investment i think our motives are pure and have been pure for decades but but but we accept these countries making their own choices what we can't accept is an outside power influencing the choices of these countries china wants a region where it has sustained military presence where it can complicate u.s military operations and australia's military operations and make those more difficult in a crisis and that's why our concerns around persistent military presence are so so real reinhard i'm just going to come to you um because with this conflict in ukraine the one thing that that germany europe has realized is its dependence the strategic blunder that's its dependence on russian oil and gas now if we look at the china question which by the way has has caused the sort of dragging of of feat as far as germany's concerned when it has come to sanctions would you if if there was a situation where we saw war with china would you say you would be in the same sort of strategic blundering position where you'd be reluctant to impose any kind of sanctions on china because again you'd be dependent well i would not assume that we're not going to learn anything from what we're experiencing and in fact the eu has started dealing with dependencies on china way before we were forced to acknowledge how biting and how crippling the kind of dependency that we developed on russia can be if you look at the eu's trade policy over the last six years we have developed a number of trade defense instruments that are designed to reduce the dependency um the the eu has also reshaped its general understanding of the relationship that we are developing and that we have with the prc in 2019 this complicated multi-dimensional relationship was described as at the same time a partnership a competition and a systemic rivalry at the moment in the european institutions there is a consensus that we are now way into rivalry territory and that the basic reality the basic truth with regard to that relationship is that we are indeed systemic rivals and that means two things that it's not just a rivalry between the two governance systems of democracy and authoritarianism at the same time it's also a uh systemic rivalry between a uh what's been called a rules-based multilateralist liberal international order and the resurgence of big power politics so i think we didn't start from zero and the lesson that we have to learn still because we cannot just turn on a heal to to wean ourselves from the gas dependency that has been built over 20 years but there's now a willingness to do that and we have had discussions in and that that's very interesting i would say in the three important china communities that we have in the uh business community in the national security community and in the human rights community we have had discussions that not being as dependent on china as we are inclined to be even though our exports to china are about a fourth of what australia's are uh still we are we saw when we when we were looking for ppe at the beginning of the pandemic how dependent we were we know that we're dependent on rare earth and a couple of other strategic minerals i think we're already in the process of transitioning away from that in the government circles the awareness of these challenges is i would say much more developed than it is at the moment with some mncs but when you look at the business community in a broader sense there is a lot of support for a new trajectory in fact it was the german federation of industry that first came out in january of 2019 with a strategy paper on china that defined china in much more critical terms than any strategy paper you had seen from europe before but but if we talk about the lessons if you want to talk about the lessons learned in ukraine right now billions have gone into russia as a result of oil and gas something that you continue to pay for and that is fueling the funds for the war in ukraine so it's one thing using the rhetoric and and using language like values and and and it's our values but as far as the ukrainian people are concerned that hasn't stopped you continue to fund the war for for the russians so we can talk about the lessons learned but but i just wonder you know how quickly have those lessons really been learned look we don't have a time machine we can can't go back in time so we have to apply the lessons that we're learning in what we're doing in the future right and there are a couple of lessons and i i put them very in very generic terms one lesson is that if you are confronted with an imperialist opponent then you should take them at their word a lot of people around europe didn't take putin at his word when he pointed out his designs on ukraine and i think the communist party emperor in china is not less ruthless than the russian tsar is so we should also take xi jinping at his word number one number two appeasement in such a confrontation leads to war and number three if you want to deter and of course i would have preferred that would we would have been able to deter putin but if you want to deter you have to start early we started deterring with half-baked measures very late in the day after putin had already concentrated his troops along the ukrainian border that effort should have started at least in 2014 so when we try to learn looking forward to what we might encounter with china i think we have to learn the lesson that we have to start thinking about deterrence for instance of an attack from the prc on taiwan or any of their other neighbors how how we can effectively influence the framework conditions under which they operate before they get close to that but right now today germany is not prepared to sanction russian oil and gas today germany has taken steps that have a momentous importance up until january a majority in our country was in favor of note stream 2. i have been a consistent opponent for years but sometimes very lonely now we've shut it down until january nobody in germany regardless from which party was willing to supply armaments to the ukrainians in case they would be attacked now we are supplying armaments where even that was the decision of i think today or yesterday were even exporting tanks to to ukraine to help them we have um formulated the policy that says we will um wean ourselves from russian coal by august from russian oil before the end of the year and from russian gas before 2024 for a country that at the moment gets 50 percent of its coal 35 of its oil and 55 of its gas from russia that's quite an ambitious turnaround i would be willing to cut off to embargo oil [Music] from russia immediately the government probably has to be a bit more cautious than a parliamentarian can be they would rather err on the side of caution i guess then on the side of audacity because if they get it wrong and if there is an industrial meltdown that is not going to weaken putin that's going to weaken us and that might create so much internal strife that we might not even be able to sustain the policies that we have now move forward to so i think we're on a very good trajectory even though i belong to those critics of the government that always push for doing more we have asked for supplying tanks for a couple of weeks now it's happening the but for the for the country this has been an hour of i would say geopolitical awakening the chancellor called it at seiten vender a historic turning point and germany had been very reluctant to accept for instance nato's 2 gdp goal now the government has pledged with the support of the parliament to spend two percent plus every year on the fence so i would not say that it it's uh adequate to just describe germany as a country that is dragging its feet we're not leading as much as we should together with france and poland and others i mean as far as the ukrainians are concerned the war crimes continue the bombs continue and and germany is not willing to take swift action so they do feel you are dragging your feet but i just want to bring me that is not correct the decisions are taken within nato and the decisions are taken within the eu but germany is one of those times not the fact that germany blocks all those decisions that is what some people peddle but it's not the truth okay i'm just going to bring in uh gudrun into the conversation because i want to pick up on on what we've just talked about this idea of values believing in something believing in freedom believing in in in democracy and yet something that i continued to hear in ukraine and and most recently when i was there and also in afghanistan when i was there in december was this sense that the west talks about these things but they're not willing to fight for them that at the end of the day they can send these weapons in but there is this sense of abandonment would you say that's accurate yes okay um i i think we have to cooperate with other countries based on values yes but also on interest and this is true for every country this is true for india this is true for the european union and actually if you look at the indo-pacific strategy of the european union it says we will strengthen our partnerships in the region based on values or interests for the germans it's a huge step to even admit that we do have national interests until recently we did not admit to have but i want to say something very fundamental because until a few years ago we all believed that economic interdependence is a stabilizing factor in international relations all of us did you know we admitted china to the wto in the hope that this would kind of integrate them in a better way and especially in this part of the world a lot of talk was about even if you have political conflicts the economic interdependence makes sure that the price is too high to go forward on the conflict part but this belief has been destroyed and not only by what russia did in ukraine it has been destroyed over the last years pretty systematically by several actors and china is obviously one of them if you start to weaponize economic relations if you start to weaponize trade and china has a pretty sophisticated toolbox how to do that that's part of what andrew was talking about these gray zone activities you know so there is disinformation there is the luring of countries with the promise of investment so you have basically you have sticks and carrots and over the last years we see china pulling out more sticks than carrots all the carrots have proven not so tasty to the countries they were offered to and and this is the world we live in but it takes a while for this realization to sink in and then act on it and this is to up to all of us and i mean china is still the biggest trading partner of india when i last looked australia has not weaned itself from the dependency on china saying that should china or in the event that china attacks taiwan the west will be as unprepared in terms of how tangled it is economically with china as it has been certainly in the case of europe uh with russia well the first issue we have to debate is how likely is it that china attacks taiwan i know i know that there is this scenario and it has been uh discussed quite a bit especially in the us and also we have to think through in europe what we would do in such a case that's that's clear but i think to come back to what conclusions china will draw from the conflict in ukraine the war in ukraine we're not there yet they're observing very closely what is going on and i think already they saw several surprising things one surprise was the unity of the west and the swiftness with which the sanctions were decided you know and germany not blocking them and the other a surprising thing is the resistance in ukraine maybe xi jinping was told by putin the same kind of narrative that putin promised at home we go in this will be a surgical operation we will be welcomed as liberators and after a week everything is over but this has not happened and now i mean if russia ends up being really economically crippled in the long term china will not be the winner because it will be the only target left of the us for one a view that i continue to hear in india and in this part of the world is that in fact it was europe and the west that should be blamed for this crisis and conflict in ukraine that they so to speak poked the bear i just want to get your response to that i wouldn't say that the west has not made any mistakes in the 90s after the demise of the soviet union and you know i'm the last person who does not admit admit that we often apply double standards and we are hypocritical and everything but double wrong does not make right this is one thing i want to say and if you in a way this is the narrative that russia is rolling out basically it's the fault of nato eastward enlargement and of the united states because nato of course is only a puppet of of the united states and that you know with nato at russia's doorstep they had no choice this narrative is pretty much embraced in this country where we are right now and the chinese are go one step further they not only embrace the narrative they actively promote it especially in southeast asia and this part of the world so they they um the media also amplified this message on ukraine wanting to develop nuclear weapons the the story about the biochemical weapons so all amplified the messages amplified by the chinese media and this this narrative that it's all nato's fault i think you know the situation we are in now um it's still clear that russia breached international law it doesn't accept the borders of a sovereign country it invaded ukraine and that's a fact and if you look at the kind of security architecture we believed to have in europe yes the osce is you know not very effective anymore nato is not inclusive and there was this institution of the nato-russia council which somehow never worked when there was some conflict between nato and russia but does this mean and and i think it's really a matter of perception and i think india should think about whether you would apply the same logic to china if china starts to argue we are threatened so much by the quad and orcas and you know nato now talking about china we have no choice because this is basically russia's argument does this justify that you invade another country and the case of taiwan of course is even more tricky because the majority of the world does not recognize taiwan as a sovereign country so what does this mean for example for the u.n would we even be able to discuss the issue at the u.n level or would we be thrown back to to our own deliberations in other formats like the g7 for example major general i'm going to bring you into the com conversation just with the question of competition between china and other regional countries would it be fair to say that south korea is perceived to be on the sidelines compared to german we are south korea is very lucky because we didn't input the russian gas or oil [Laughter] but south korean so far the south korean government policy is to try to maintain the balancing position between the china and u.s because the uh indian pacific strategy and one belt and one road is its conflict in the northeast asia and also the north korea tried to test the nuclear missiles so south korea has maintained the good economic relationship with the china and instead of the economics we try to good relations between u.s but in recently because of the ukraine conflict our president-elect uh yoon he who will uh in inaugurated the two weeks later uh he changed the new government to change our position would be so he yesterday he announced that south korea is trying to examine to join the quote or of course and everything to strength stressing the us in india and strategy did you say that south korea should join the quarter would join yet but the president yunis officially announced yesterday we will examine to join the court so our position will be changes south korean government position will be changed so far we try to maintain the good economic relationships with china but the ukraine situations we are we can learn the change in the stressing of realism in the world so we have to need the good military and economic relations with the in india and pacific strategy with the u.s instead of china is there um some kind of timeline for for when you would consider or want to discuss being part of the quad taiwan no for south korea timeline timeline no i i don't know yet yet but uh now the new uh president elect is uh their government is trying to join very uh maybe this year or next year okay i'm i mean i'm i'm conscious we've got three minutes and there's probably a lot of questions um in the room um so i'm going to take uh three questions the mics are uh just in front i i'll take them all at the one time and then we'll put put it to the panel so if you have questions please feel free i believe there's one back there yeah please go ahead introduce yourself and your question um hello my name is elizabeth i'm also part of the racina young fellows and i do have a question primarily for all of you i was wondering um talking about poking the bear um the european union also well has been asked or ukraine wants to join the european union and a couple of days ago the austrian foreign minister also well expressed kind of criticism or cautiousness about this idea because the conflict will not be resolved anytime soon and even then we have to ask ourselves how this is going to impact the relationship with russia so i would be was wondering what's your position in this regard and the second question we're very much and very often hearing about strategic autonomy but i was also wondering why don't we more often hear about strategic coherence so that i mean the the military aspirations on the one hand but we are also kind of increasing our economic interdependencies one more time this time in a diversified manner and with other countries but in a long-term perspective i was wondering why especially after 2014 it was not clear to the european union especially and also to germany that this kind of economic dependence was kind of contradictory so this kind of incoherence this term strategic hearing should be used and applied more often so what's your i would be interested what's your position in this regard thank you very much thank you um and i'll take one question there and then there and then i'll put it back yeah just there thank you very much uh my name is dr phil devoid olofsky i'm from imamo russian academy of sciences i have a question addressed to anybody who will be ready to answer we have heard a lot about how russia is guilty how which uh it should uh respond for what it it has done in ukraine here but uh and a lot of words how to support ukraine fighting against russia but nobody said about any said about diplomatic solutions for this crisis and how do you see what can be done in this year how we can resolve this crisis by diplomatic means thank you thank you and just one there okay i am danter from taiwan i and this uh esr we can see that uh after ukraine war after ukraine work uh maybe uh two years ago uh many general and many experts uh predict that uh taiwan strait will become war uh maybe one one year later or maybe two years maybe 2027 but after ukraine war i i like to add maybe dr uh gudrun walker or maybe admiral because we can see that the general uh from us say maybe 20 35 china will invent taiwan what do you think the timeline that china will invent taiwan we can see recently xi jinping may be in trouble in his 20-20 party congress power arrangement or maybe in the shanghai my colleague said uh recently uh mentioned about the shanghai pandemic control you can see that a different reflection a power struggle in shanghai city yeah so what do you think that this situation would affect that the china invest thai taiwan timeline okay thank you got it um uh so the first question it was about poking the bear in ukraine joining uh the eu and the sort of implications of that perhaps reinhardt you can you can answer that sure i would predict that in the european institutions there will probably be a decision before this summer break that ukraine will be granted candidate status that does not imply that next year there will be a member but the accession mechanism is so flexible that it can be speeded up according to the progress that we're making so i say this because in several in two council meetings since the beginning of the war for the first time the european council indicated that not only would they um promise the ukrainians some vague participation in the european family of nations somewhere in the future but that they pledge to support ukraine's accession so that is i think uh a new trajectory uh that we're that we're engaging on and if i can answer the second question from elizabeth also the term strategic autonomy is becoming less prominent and less attractive around europe because um in a time when you have to understand that in tackling the challenges from some authoritarian regimes you better team up with with your friends and partners naval gazing is not necessarily the best answer in the german context we are not talking about strategic autonomy in the new government we're talking about two terms strategic sovereignty of europe and pulling together more closely and strategic solidarity with democracies and like-minded countries okay we've just got a couple of minutes but we i'd like these two questions answered uh one was um about political solutions diplomatic solutions for this conflict in ukraine i don't know who wants to answer that one maybe i can offer a dull answer which is um i i think that has to be dominated by ukraine and how ukraine sees this conflict and what it demands and that the fact that ukraine is fighting for its sovereignty and its very survival gives it such prominence and and just to answer the other question i think even on the eu piece even as as somebody from a nation that is no longer a member of the eu again this is about ukraine being able to choose whether or not it wants to apply to join the eu and and i would also just add on the strategic coherence point there there has been phenomenal strategic coherence in the way that the world has responded to the ukraine conflict so all the instruments of power being used in a very classical way so whether that's diplomatic economic power the the use of the military instrument and and the use of information and and cultural and social issues i think this is this is an example of surprisingly strategic coherence in the way that the world has responded thank you admiral and and finally andrew i i wonder you know we this question about whether there's a timeline for when china potentially attacks taiwan so yalda our assessment is that beijing's overwhelming preference is to take control of taiwan without using kinetic military force and at the moment what we see is beijing using economic coercion cyber attacks political interference incursions by pla warships and aircraft into taiwan the space around taiwan to put pressure on the taiwan government so that desirably from beijing's point of view taiwan comes to the negotiating table on beijing's terms that's overwhelmingly what they're trying to achieve but there's no question that they are working very very hard to give themselves a military option as well even though it's not their preference we see the development of a massive range of sophisticated weapon systems one of our concerns flowing from the situation in ukraine is that the importance of nuclear weapons is actually being reinforced to china the importance of subduing an enemy quickly is being reinforced but but by the same token the difficulties that the russian military has faced as tony said should be giving serious pause to people in beijing about the complexity of an operation to seize taiwan and the hardest operation in warfare is a contested amphibious landing and it's possible with sensible policy decisions in taipei and support from international partners that the the military problem of of seizing taiwan can be made incredibly complex and difficult and that there can be more time put into that timeline unfortunately we have run out of time so ladies and gentlemen if you could please thank my panelists thank you
mDunLLq6ohU,Anti-China demonstration in Manila,"(9 Apr 2019) Hundreds of protesters gathered at the Chinese Consulate in Manila on Tuesday, demanding the removal of Chinese presence in the disputed islands in the South China Sea.
Various activist groups joined in the demonstration, from Filipino cyclists to youth groups, holding up anti-China placards and banners while waving the Philippine flag. 
They also criticized Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's government for not standing against China.
Neri Colmenares, the protest leader and a senatorial candidate running against Duterte's senatorial bets, said Filipinos have the courage ""to assert our territorial integrity.""
Duterte has adopted a non-confrontational approach in territorial spats with Beijing while seeking Chinese infrastructure funds, trade and investment.
He has often had to walk a tightrope when discussing China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters, where Manila and Beijing, along with four other governments, have wrangled for control of territory.
The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs last week issued a rare public rebuke of large numbers of Chinese vessels near islands and islets occupied by the Philippines in the disputed waters, saying the Chinese presence was illegal. 
The Philippine military has monitored more than 200 Chinese vessels from January to March in a disputed area named Sandy Cay near a Philippine-occupied island called Pag-asa by Filipinos.
The protest was also held to commemorate the Philippine holiday 'Araw ng Kagitingan' (Day of Valor), which remembers the heroic efforts of Filipino troops during World War II.

MxVmOpqos1c,China Violates The Philippines’ Sovereignty While Russia Distracts The,"Since Russia invaded Ukraine, China has maintained that it respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and Russia’s security concerns. However, China’s actions reveal otherwise: China respects Russia, while it blatantly disrespects its neighbors’ sovereignty. For years, China has bullied the Philippines and other neighbors, building islands within their waters, harassing their fishing boats and security personnel, plundering fish from their waters, and blocking their routine military actions. And while the world focused on Russian troops amassing at the Ukraine border, China blatantly violated the Philippines’ sovereignty, presumably so it could spy on a U. S.-Philippine military exercise. The Philippines only recently released information about the incident, and the world—distracted by Russia—has done almost nothing in response. The U. S. and its allies must condemn China’s actions, call out its hypocrisy, and ensure that China stops violating its neighbors’ sovereign rights. On January 29, a Chinese Navy reconnaissance ship entered the Sulu Sea and lingered for three days until February 1. The ship sailed near the Philippines’ Cuyo Island group and Apo Island before exiting the sea. Under the U. N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which both the Philippines and China are parties, the Sulu Sea is entirely within the Philippines’ sovereign waters. The Chinese vessel did not comply with Philippine Navy demands for it to leave Philippine waters. The spy ship’s sojourn in the Sulu Sea was a particularly egregious episode in China’s repeated infringements upon its neighbors’ sovereignty. The illegal incursion occurred during a military exercise by Philippine and U. S. Marines. The exercise, held between January 27 and February 2, was designed to boost the treaty allies’ mutual defense capabilities. Several U. S. Navy ships participated in the exercise, which involved a simulation of an amphibious landing on hostile soil. The intrusion occurred as China is increasingly asserting control over the South China Sea, including its neighbors’ sovereign waters. China employs an extensive maritime militia disguised as a civilian fishing fleet to harass its neighbors and illegally plunder their fish. It brazenly spied on a U. S.-Australian military exercise last July. On March 14, the Philippines summoned the Chinese envoy over the illegal incursion, making the incident public for the first time. The Philippines has not explained why it took more than a month to publicize or act on the violation of its sovereignty. The Philippine Congress promptly launched an inquiry into China’s recent, repeated violations of its waters. China claims that the ship was exercising the right of “innocent passage” pursuant to UNCLOS. However, UNCLOS requires that innocent passage be transit from one point to another that is “continuous and expeditious.” Lingering for three days cannot be considered expeditious or continuous.

POta8gSXalo,"China, Philippines Need Joint Development, Cooperation in Post Arbitration Phase:  Expert","What really meets the interests of people in the Philippines and China is joint development and cooperation in areas of common concern, said a Philippine political analyst. 

Richard Javad Heydarian, an associate professor in De La Salle University, made the remarks during an exclusive interview with China Central Television (CCTV) on Wednesday in Manila. He first analyzed the current situation of Rodrigo Duterte administration after an arbitration award released. 

As the Philippine foreign ministry only made a very short declaration after the award in the South China Sea Arbitration was published on Tuesday, Heydarian thought Duterte kept his promise of treating the award with a ""soft landing"" instead of flaunting. 

""I think the Duterte administration's decision was the best thing for the Philippines to do in the post arbitration phase, (because it) is a 'soft landing', so essentially how to use this verdict as a guidance for us to move forward when we bilaterally engage China. So the court has already said its position, but what's important is how the Philippines and China on their own resolve their differences,"" said Heydarian. 

The Duterte administration is under the pressure from the United States and Japan, said Heydarian. Those countries want the Philippines to give a strong declaration on the award, for fear that their so called ""freedom of navigation"" operations will be affected. It's a trail for Duterte. 

""If the Philippines doesn't release a strong statement calling for enforcement, it will be a little bit tricky for the United States and other countries to justify what they called 'freedom of navigation' operations in this area. So this is the tricky game that Duterte is playing right now. He's under pressure by the United States and Japan,"" he said. 

Heydarian believed that Duterte's unique character may give an opportunity for the Philippines to get away from the United States as he is seeking an independent foreign policy. However, Heydarian was worried that if China takes strong measures on the South China Sea issue, Duterte may choose to beat back. Thus he thought the best choice for the Philippines is to accept China's assistance and focus on development. 

""I think his strategic objective is not only to protect the Philippine maritime claims and Philippine rights within its exclusive economic zone, but the bigger priority also here is to preserve friendly and constructive relations with China. I think that Duterte realizes that China is very important for the Philippines if the Philippines wants to upgrade its creaking infrastructure landscape, and I'm sure that China for the past few months has already made a lot of offers that it's willing to help the Philippines to operate its infrastructure, to build new railways. I think under the framework of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or the maritime silk road initiative or based on bilateral infrastructure agreements, China could be very crucial for the Philippines to develop itself further,"" he said. 

He also pointed out that what really meets the interests of both countries' people is to freeze the disputes and concentrate on joint development and cooperation instead of escalating the conflicts. 

""As a formula of Zhou Enlai or Deng Xiaoping would put it, shelve sovereignty which is intractable and zero sum, focus on joint development, focus on cooperation, focus on areas of common concern. I think we are essentially trying to do a Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping formula here. It's much more difficult than the past because now we have passionate public in both the Philippines and China. That is why both the Xi Jinping administration and the Duterte administration have to stand their ground and prioritize the bigger interest. The bigger interest is, we revive our bilateral ties. The bigger interest is, we avoid further conflict,"" he said. 

As the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting will soon be held in late July, Heydarian said it may be a good chance for both countries to start dialogue and find a way to deal with the disputes.  More on:

PvpOb7uX984,"Forum: The U.S., China and the Geopolitics of the South China Sea","The U.S., China, and the Geopolitics of the South China Sea

The South China Sea is among the world’s epicenters of geopolitical competition. 30 percent of all global trade ($5.3 trillion) passes through the waterway each year. China and its East Asian neighbors, including Indonesia, Japan, The Philippines, and Vietnam all have territorial claims, and established maritime defenses. Meanwhile in its pivot to Asia, the United States has been conducting freedom of navigation tours of its vessels in waters claimed by China.

How can the U.S and China reduce the risk of conflict, and work on a peaceful and equitable resolution in this pivotal international waterway?

Filmed at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum on February 21, 2018.",0,"[Music] [Music] thank you very much thank you Jim for you mighta me as a moderator for today's event it's a very important event as you know the next door to Nixon Library and I've been a frequent visitor and take advantage of all the resources from this library when I was a child back in China I saw a Nixon picture in my school it's a picture of of Nixon while it was visiting China that was 1970s it was very I never thought about working next door to Nixon Library it's just amazing and here I'm a moderate in this event we have two specialists today and first one is mr. cope as cool per the third senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corporation and a member of the party rand graduate school faculty let's welcome mr. Gregory Poland director of the Asian Asia maritime transparency initiative and a fellow was the Southeast Asia program and the Center for Strategic and International Studies based in Washington DC now the questions I received yesterday from Jim and I reviewed them those are very well established questions and they also sound very neutral and objective and I noticed that this is obviously just the opportunity for the audience to know about the facts objective information about the issue of us-china and the reef geopolitics of South China Sea the entire session consists of three parts first introduction part one is territory where is it what is it what was the what's the what's the what is non - line for example all these pieces of facts flowing in the information we need to get to know exactly what it is we have a set of question eight questions here part two resources in global trade part three the military part two we have about part two for questions part three for questions as well so we're gonna do a sort of a QA so that it'll be more interactive more dynamic we have two speakers so the two feel free to answer to the best of your knowledge about these questions number one how did you how did each of you come to study Asia Pacific affairs and the topic were about to discuss okay first off thanks dr. Joe it's a pleasure to be here it's an honor to be at the Nixon Library and looking looking forward to the time with you and thankfully you started out I guess with the easier questions first I if I can remember far enough back to when I did come to study Asia Pacific affairs and the topic we're about to discuss I guess I guess I came I came to study Asia Pacific affairs beginning in about 1988 I was in my eighth year in the military at the time I was in the US Army and was a communications officer and serving serving in in Europe initially and sort of focused obviously in in that direction because at that time there was there was such a thing as the as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic and so that was that was where I began looking at raw not looking toward toward China at all but I went into the foreign area officers in the army and in 1988 began training and studying to begin looking looking toward toward China it was pretty fascinating time obviously to start looking at at China at that point is that you know again in the aftermath of a day that we celebrate today as an anniversary when Nixon went to China and China began opening up to the west and began the economic opening that in many ways after that would you know would change a lot of things to include changing my life I guess so so that's when I began studying it and through the military career a few assignments that were focused on on China and various various respects then when I retired from the military in 2000 as my wife said I had trouble holding down a job I was in probably five different organizations throughout the years following 2000 before landing at RAND Corporation and in all of those I had had had some some opportunity to to look at China and the Asia Pacific or Indo Pacific in general I guess the highlight I would say of sort of those some in government summit in the private sector probably the highlight would be time out in in US Pacific Command as the senior intelligence analysts looking at looking at China looking at the asia-pacific and advising the commander of Pacific Command in that regard before then later coming back to Washington DC and continuing to work on China stuff not a Southeast Asia expert I am focused generally on more generally on on China and the Chinese military and pretty busy of late because as many of you know the Chinese military is in the most most important and you know and most extensive reorganization restructuring effort at least since the 1980s and maybe since the dawn of the People's Republic so I mean kind of busy with that the good news is we do in fact have destacia expert with us who will be able to clarify things that that i may be unable to during the course of the discussion all right great yeah so I've been working Asia slightly less slightly shorter amount of time than Cortez has but I started off as a China hand or thought I was at trying to hand I did history in undergrad I spent time in China lived and worked went to school there when I decided to go back to graduate school and start studying international relations cuz the historians don't get a lot of job offers other than to teach history I somehow migrated south and so I came into a master's program thinking I was going to do China and I decided that I found Southeast Asia more fascinating so if you if you approach try enough from the idea that it is the great challenge that the US will face over the course of a century and I think it is we're not doomed to conflict but we are certainly locked in a an era of competition then Southeast Asia is the the frontline of that competition right the competition for influence within these states the states that border China is where a lot of the future of the century is gonna be written much as Eastern Europe was the front line in the battle competition was the Soviet Union and so I've been spending most of my time these days in Manila and Hanoi and Jakarta and I started working South China Sea issues somewhat by accident I was not a security specialist that was not a military specialist I would focus much more on politics and the rules you know how does international law work how how do we make the international community function and the South China Sea is in a sense the first test case of how China's rising China's going to behave so if you're looking for one area where we can definitively say yes or no China is going to be a rules enforcer going to help us enforce the the way the system works or China's going to seek to overturn the entire 20th century project the South's trying to see is is that test case and so that's how I and I assume both of you speak Chinese I used to know not as well as you doctor will there be a test well I'm beginning to speak broken Chinese because I don't speak that much alright great so a second question of the introduction is from your own perspectives what challenges does the South China Sea bring to the current state and future of us-china relations okay I'll go first like I say then Gregg can can correct all of my my mistakes I wanted to get just a couple of points across here before the questions being because they may or may not come up and they do bear certainly do bear on the future of us-china relations and how the South China Sea impacts that and I agree completely with Gregg I think the South China Sea really is the cauldron where we can see where this what our recent national defense strategy would call our competition with China is headed and how and how China's going to behave as they themselves have said they're gonna become increasingly involved in a global leadership role which i think is to be expected given their given the size of that country given their their economic clout etc and I think that's how China Sea will be a test case if you will right I think more is kind of the cauldron where that happens in the first point I would make is that I think behind any of the activities that happen the individual activities that happen in the South China Sea us activities their Chinese activities there the response of the region and the other claimants to features within the South China Sea a backdrop to that really is the the larger strategic mistrust if you will between the US and China right now and I think that you see a lot of China's responses to US presence in the region to u.s. activities military activities and operations as well as other diplomatic and economic activities in Southeast Asia are seen through a prism of still through a prism of containment of the u.s. trying to in some way contain China's rise and it makes it very difficult reason that's important as it makes it very difficult for for us interlocutors with their with their Chinese counterparts really to to get past to get past that initial kind of mistrust and and really get to the to the root of the issues that face us and and and what our expectations as as Americans are for how us role in Asia will play out and so I think that is that is difficult unfortunately there there's there's not a lot we can do about it I think we need to nibble away at the edges of that South China Sea is an area where we can do that by continuing to hold discussions in our military-to-military relationship on ways to to manage problems when US and Chinese forces or US and Chinese you know vessels or aircraft of any sort might come into contact in the South China Sea how do we manage those crises what mechanisms do we put in place these are small things but they're very important things and I think that again the South China Sea can be an area where over time certainly there could be a lot of problems but there's also opportunity there and we shouldn't shouldn't miss that but by the same token we shouldn't we shouldn't assume that because Chinese China's reaction will be negative to certain activities that that take place in the South China Sea that we should avoid those activities that would be a mistake I think there are there are ways that that we need to confront China when there's activities or behaviors in the South China Sea which we disagree with such as much of the island building activity that's been going on recently and we have to figure out ways to convince China that the risk of these activities is not worth not worth the cost and that there still is a risk aversion on the part of the Chinese to to get into conflict with the United States I agree with Gregg I don't think conflict is inevitable and I don't think the Chinese want conflict but we need to make sure that we stand our ground in certain areas the maritime domain for China is different from the maritime domain recent activities are the on the border with with Bhutan and and the Indian involvement there if you're familiar with with that activity recently the response of India to that both militarily and diplomatically I think is a good example of how standing up to China when you see them doing things in disputed areas can be can be advantageous and can lead to can lead to some good things doesn't mean that the problem goes away we're not resolving unfortunately many of these disputes we're managing them but there are ways to manage them and in the absence of resolution that's a good thing second point I would make is is it it's very interesting of the current effectiveness at least from my perspective of China despite their activities in the South China Sea Island building and other things like that to see the effectiveness of what some have called China's charm offensive in Southeast Asia you know China's the majority the region probably is still very very schizophrenic they're very concerned about Chinese activity but at the same time the Chinese have economic clout they have the belt and Road initiative that they've started that will bring infrastructure projects to countries right now probably China's relations with with Malaysia another South China Sea claimant or as good as they've been in many decades you know the Philippines would probably have some questions it will deal with the President Duterte later but there's there's issues there you know where China can can potentially divide and conquer if you will and that's really the the effort appears to be behind trying to to blame the US for the things that China is doing there to make it look defensive in nature to get the region to think that the u.s. is the problem and and then to have them somehow buy off on this idea that the u.s. is not a regional actor in the South China Sea and to build on that the the third thing I'll talk about is real quickly just the growing growing what appears to be growing risk acceptance on the part of the PRC as I pointed out earlier they don't want conflict with the United States they don't particularly want conflict they need their neighbors but I think that there's a growing with with their growing military capability and with now a consolidation of power and Xi Jinping's hands a very very powerful leader there there appears to be a growing level of risk acceptance that China can can in fact be more assertive in some of the activities that they do say in the South China Sea and then manage it so that it still stays below the level of open conflict and my concern of that is that it's a again a type of brinksmanship that that could lead to miscalculation and escalation and in some of the Chinese sources over the past few years and I have have had a chance to write a little bit about this you you see you see some of Chinese strategists thinking through the idea that that crises can be managed in a way that provide opportunity in a way that will change the status quo and to China's advantage and again these are these are mostly theoretical and strategic thinking but but they indicate that I think that there's maybe a growing confidence and a built-in ability to control escalation that may in fact be a dangerous way of thinking because escalation is not an easy thing to control and the final thing I'll point out is something I mentioned to Gregg earlier and like hopefully he can address it also at some point is the idea of we'll see in a minute of Chinese claims this this 9 - landing the expansiveness of China's claims in the South China Sea in many ways I think it's counterproductive for China itself China really seeks to you know again not have the region lining up against it but rather to deal bilaterally with all of the actors that have claims in the South China Sea kind of theory exclude the US and make deals with the actors this idea of a massive sort of Chinese Lake this big claim to me seems to be to be counterproductive to China itself that if they would that if there was an acceptance that a vast portion of the South China Sea is open water and again very important for the flow of trade etc and then deal with other issues perhaps as they would like on a Bible all nature you know defining exclusive economic zones from the main boundaries of every country and then working on individual problems that it would be easier that this idea of a large claim to me is something that's it's very problematic and and again not sure exactly where the Chinese are going with it so with that that's sort of the challenges as I see them hope that wasn't too long Greg all right Thank You mr. Pollan yeah so I two things first when we think about the South China Sea if you've read any reporting over the last several years about the South China Sea you're probably well you've probably read that it's a territorial dispute that the US and Beryl then which is wrong four points I will point out later we don't care there is a territorial dispute there we just don't care who owns which rock and reef that's not our US interest it never will be and to that this is a military conflict and it's not there was a military dimension to this just as there is a military dimension in almost any competition geopolitically there is no military solutions to the South China Sea the US you know the Pentagon under no illusions that there are military solutions to South China Sea and it's not our top interest we have three interests three very important interests and then a whole bevy of other smaller things but those three are first the ability of the US military to operate to fly sail and operate it's often the phrase use in the South China Sea so-called freedom of navigation for our ships and planes that is one interest it is certainly the most directly military of our interests it's not the most important of our three interests second defense of our allies we have a treaty Ally in the Philippines that treaty Ally is going to face a situation sometime the next few years in which the Chinese are probably gonna send a Philippine Coast Guard Navy vessel to the bottom two South China Sea and then either the u.s. responds as we are legally and morally bound to do or we don't and if we don't then every ally of the US has globally it's gonna start wondering what the price is on their head because the Philippines aren't worth standing up for maybe the Japanese are more important but they must have some price and so there's a issue of us credibility definitely regional and potentially global and then the third and the hardest to get ahold of the hardest to fit into a you know a news article but I think the most important is the question of the rules-based order overall the South China Sea is a place where the Chinese are claiming a thousand miles of water and seabed in direct contravention of international law that the Chinese helped negotiate and that they signed if the Chinese get their way then one of if not the most universally accepted pieces of international law that we have had over the 20th century UN Convention the law of the sea will be a dead letter and pretty soon after that the Russians will start claiming vast swaths of the Arctic and the Iranians will demand special rights to restrict the Persian Gulf and it'll be a race to grab the ocean and what will basically have is a system in which big navies and big countries get to make their own rules and you know we spent the better part of the 20th century post-world War two trying to make a system that prevents that in which yes we have great power competition but rules and institutions order the way international relations work not who has the biggest ships is this what Trump calls an example of the revision tremendous power or yes so this is definitely a case I think the most clear case of Chinese revisionism and to be clear the Chinese are not a threat to US interests institutions in the way the Soviet Union was they do not present an existential threat they don't want to turn over the entire system they want to turn over specific parts of the system to make them work better for them and so the Chinese want one set of rules to exist globally and another set to work just in Asia and we said Chinese have a special sphere of influence but guess what the rule of law only works if it were if it applies universally you can't have a rule of law that doesn't apply to certain countries and so in this case the Chinese certainly are interested in revisionism in the 1970s and 1980s they helped negotiate these rules the only thing that has changed is that they've gotten bigger and now they feel like maybe the rules don't work for them anymore that's not the way rules are supposed to work all right thank you that's a good introduction let's move to part one territory exactly where is the South China Sea on a map which country's border its waters so let's see yeah so I'm happy to jump in here so this is a map that my team at a Mt I helped put together with National Geographic I ran in and their magazine a few months ago what you're seeing the lines there are the continental shelves in the South China Sea and so earlier when I said that US interests are not in the territorial disputes in the South China Sea what I mean is we need to think of this as two different disputes you have a dispute over territory and if you look in the map there you'll see in the north the Paracel Islands in the South the Spratly Islands and over on the east Scarborough Shoal those are disputed pieces of rock and reef you have five different countries that claim sovereignty over these islands and the US doesn't care who's right we certainly care that nobody uses military force to decide the question but we don't really care whether or not those are Chinese rocks or Philippine rocks or Malaysian rocks but you have a second interconnected overlapping claim that we do care about and those are the claims to water in airspace because those are the claims on which we all negotiated a treaty 40 years ago that's supposed to make sure that we don't have a land grab for the oceans and so what you're seeing here are conical shells based on on the the coastlines of the surrounding countries this is the way that claims to water isn't she better supposed to work you have a coastline you get to claim 200 miles of waters from that coastline and you get the claim 200 miles of seabed and potentially further based on geology that's it if you look at the nine dash line those dotted lines that's China's claim that claim extends about a thousand miles as it's furthest end China bases this on vague historic rights that only applies to Beijing of 192 countries in the world China sinks only it gets to claim a thousand miles of water and seabed and so if you're the Vietnamese and that Chinese claim is accepted you're essentially a landlocked state you have no fishing rights at least no exclusive fishing rights you have no rights to undersea oil and gas you have no rights whatsoever except those that China gives you the Philippines it's almost as bad you one coastline not two and so here is where the US interests actually lie peaceful resolution of the territorial disputes but we don't care how they actually get resolved and making sure that the nine dash line is not accepted because if the nine dash line is accepted then the rulebook itself means nothing all right let's move on to number four question number four in 1982 the United Nations Convention on the law in the sea divided the territorial sea and rights to maritime sources to the respective countries in the region generally how did this convention divide the sea we'll look at slide two general provisions of UCL OS the way that the oceans worked the way the law in the oceans worked since at least the 17th century prior to 1982 was this you had three miles of territorial sea after that everything was high seas that's the way it worked that's the way the British Empire did business it worked for the countries with the biggest navies in the 1950s we had the first UN Convention law of the sea and then over the course of two decades countries began negotiating what came to be known as unclose - and then on close three that's the ones that are operating now that system was meant to give small countries coastal countries a fair shake - basically prior to this prior to 1982 the US the Russians the Brits controlled the oceans we had the Bluewater navies we were gonna pull up oil and gas we were gonna fish we were gonna mine for guano anywhere we wanted and if you were a coastal state tough what we ended up coming up with a grand compromise so to speak in 1982 was a system in which we split responsibility between the coastal states who maybe didn't have big Bluewater navies but deserve some of those economic resources and then the blue water Navy states like us who wanted international waters and so now instead of three miles you have a 12-mile territorial sea considerably bigger within that territorial sea it might as well be your land you have full rights that is your territory nobody can enter or exit with except in innocent passage without your permission beyond that out to 200 nautical miles you have what's called the exclusive economic zone these are high seas except only you can make use the water so only you can fish only you can do certain scientific research things like that and alongside of that you have the conical shelf it's basically easy for the seabed so if the water above it is your easy the seabed below it is your kind of shelf only you can pull up oil and gas only you can do deep seabed mining etc all of this was again the grand bargain the u.s. Navy can operate in these waters but only the coastal state gets to fish on the coastal state gets to pull up oil and gas etc and then anything beyond that obviously is high seas so when you get beyond 200 miles it's a free-for-all it's a Wild West I mean there are rules but for the most part anybody can do what they want this was the bargain that the Chinese held negotiate they were a leading member of the developing state negotiating team remember China has an enormous coastline but at the start of the 20th century I mean up until really the 1990s they had no Navy to speak of they were a brown water Navy and so it was in China's interests to try to extend coastal rights as far as they could and it was in the US and Russian interests to push back on that as much as we could we wanted to keep three miles cuz in three miles we win right we can sail anywhere in the world this is a bargain we stink everybody else is still ok with that bargain except for Beijing yeah the only thing I would add to that is just because it's important again for the discussion to follow and for understanding some of the things that you see in the media perhaps is that the Commission on the law of the sea doesn't does not deal with sovereignty you know you don't see sovereignty on this list and a lot of China's behavior is again through its sovereignty claims to to to use that as a reason to say that certain things that clearly are are indicated in the commission of law of the sea are null and void such as a 2016 tribunal that the Philippines bought in front of in front of international law court you know Beijing can claim that that's null and void because they are focused on the other sovereignty issue first and foremost and as Greg said they the the the understanding of sea features and demarcation is D limitations and and marine rights that are dealt with in conventional law at sea some of the things that the Chinese have been doing both in the South China Sea and and more recently a little bit beyond principally to the to the the South China Sea to the is to the west of the Philippines if you look to the east of the Philippines an area called the Benham rise which is clearly by the UN Commission on law inclusive economic zone of the Philippines the Chinese have recently been doing activity there that indicates again perhaps less than an appreciation for and perhaps an outright abrogation of the things that are spelled out in the convention of all the sea so you know again looking looking forward to what might comes you know might come beyond as we begin to deal with some of the issues in the South China Sea it it doesn't it doesn't look good again for the rules-based order alright so sorry I don't want to there's a lot here and we don't all need to be international lawyers but there is one thing that does matter a lot in the South China Sea besides this territorial sea exclusive economic zone kinda shelf regime and that is Islands the legal status of violence this was hotly contested during negotiations for for unclose for good reason right at the start of 20th century you had especially on the part of the US Britain France a lot of very tiny islands that we had basically taken sovereignty over from the 18th century on for guano mining and things like that little specks of rocky sand and it would be absurd to claim giant areas of the sea based on those specks of land and so we again came up with a compromise under the UN Convention law of the sea your coastline and any of your islands that are above water high tide automatically get a territorial sea that's a given only the ones that can support human habitation naturally get an exclusive economic zone or kind of shelf and this matters so if you claim a rock that happens to stick above the water somewhere in the Pacific you don't get to claim a 200-mile easy and kind of shelf of bed if you have an island with people living on it yes that is also your coastline and so in a place like the South trying to see where the vast majority of these features were underwater to begin with and the ones that do stick up above water if you left a guy there for a week you're gonna come back and find a skeleton these do not generate easy sand kind of shells and this is exactly what the 2016 arbitral communal the Philippines brought this international case against China was heard for three years they ruled in 2016 they said none of these at least in the Spratlys or islands nobody's ever lived there before the 20th century if you pulled out the desalination plants nobody would have water to drink on them obviously they can't support human habitation alright thank you move on to how does this correspond to East cut each country's territorial claims do they have more or less adhere to the convention we have another map please explain it so nobody's claims here are perfect let's get that out of the way the Chinese often like to complain well we're not the only ones making excessive claims and in a sense they're right there are minor problems minor legal issues with some of the other countries claims the Vietnamese claim what are called straight baselines that are too excessive in the south the Malaysians haven't issued navigational charts like they're supposed to things like that but these are differences in interpretation of the treaty everybody else except for China is at least making their claims based on on clothes now the Chinese are making claims entirely outside of that system and so there is a difference in kind here and arguing over whether or not the Vietnamese the Filipinos or the Malaysians might have slightly excessive claims misses the point they might a lot of countries do it is I mean Minh nature you are gonna try to get as much as you can within the balance of the system until somebody tells you otherwise but everybody else at least argument from the same point the same starting point except for Beijing Beijing is claiming historic rights that are found nowhere in international law or the UN Convention on the wall of the city and they are basically saying that none of their neighbors get an exclusive economic zone they all have to share every fish and every drop of oil that comes out of these waters with China alright so how does China define and defend these claims about it a little bit but I guess a little more detail I think in in 2009 in a basically a verbal note if you will to the UN China presented these presented this claim this rough claim based on the nine - line on historical maps I guess and materials like that that were produced pretty vague and produced those kind of in response to to the Philippines in Vietnam Malaysia presentations to the to the UN at the time and you know and again they they have remained ambiguous in terms of the exact definition of the nine - line I you know I can surmise why that might be you know it's a question that Greg and I've talked about in terms of whether it's it's something that's meant to be used as a as a bargaining chip or whether it is something that's meant to be clarified at a later date or you know it's very it's very difficult to tell the the history here is it's instructive because it's the meaning of the nine dash line the way the China makes its claim has changed vastly over the course of the last few decades so if you go back to the 1930s when this map these dashes originated what happened is that officials in southern China at the time the the Republic of China under the Nationalist government they decided that they want to make claim to these islands based largely on the fact that the French under the guise of the Protectorate in Tonkin when they were still the colonial masters of Indochina were claiming these islands and so when the Chinese government the Nationalists heard about this they asked alright what are these Islands why are the French claim in them should we be making an objection originally under the ching dynasty high Hainan the the Big Island there at the southern tip of China was considered the southern limits of Chinese territory by the 1920s ish they had extended that to include the Paracels at least in some documents in the 1930s 1937 I think when the French claimed the Spratlys for the first time all of a sudden China also claimed the Spratlys now those are matters for historical arguments that again the u.s. doesn't care about but where the nine-dash line came in is that the Chinese had no idea where these islands were in those cases when the French landed on the Spratlys it made a claim the Chinese consul general in Manila had to ask the u.s. governor for a map to show where the Spratlys was we have the documents showing they had no idea the vast majority of these islands now are chinese transliterations of british names because they just took the British charts and you know renamed all of them because they had no native names for them which leads to a whole bunch of mistakes where they for instance named under water features Islands - they didn't understand what a shoal was on British navigational charts but to encompass this vast ambiguous Island claimed that they had no real clear charts of they just drew these dashes and so then in 1947 the Nationalist government officially accepts this 9 - line the original title which was a map of China's southern islands basically saying we don't really know where the islands are but any Islands within that line belong to China over the years since that claim has been accepted by the PRC the People's Republic of China and it has expanded so what started off as a claim to Islands has now become a claim to islands and water and airspace and seabed and this vast historic rights a word that nobody talked about until the 1990s has been used to try to explain all of this all of it basically comes down to bad history that the Chinese have forgotten what the line meant in the first place and I'm now filled in the gaps with this weird historic rights claim so let me ask you why 9 - instead of 10 or 11 or 7 what are they in the form of certain bricks or what kind of material just the symbol on the map not only has the definition of the lines change the number of lines have changed over the years so the original map drawn by the Republic of China with 11 dashes included two dashes in the gulf of tonkin those eleven dashes are still on maps in Taiwan so Taiwan still has this claim they don't claim it under historic rights like the PRC does they still the same one trying to got rid of the two dashes when they negotiated a boundary in the gulf of tonkin with the vietnamese they've since added back another line so there was now 10 lines on the current Chinese map because they've added another one on the east side of Taiwan to make clear that Taiwan is also part of their claim so the the number of dashes and their placement shifts and moves year-to-year the State Department did a study in 2009 I think I'm sorry in 2012 where they tried to figure out exactly where the dashes are because there are no coordinates I mean there is no navigational chart that shows sailors where the limits of China's claim is and I think they said there were at least 11 or maybe 13 different versions of the line that have been published in Chinese government documents over the years all of them slightly different and so you can find a map that the US state of are made of where all of these dashes move and change and overlap and if you were to connect them the most recent official one from 2009 what's interesting is a slice of Borneo cut within the line if he has connected them so apparently Malaysian territory falls within it you literally couldn't throw a stone off palawan off the Philippines without landing in Chinese territory I mean they are patently absurd in a sense of no reasonable cartographer in China would ever think to make this a claim they're just kind of stuck with it now and they have to figure out ways to explain it and interpret it so non dashed line is basically a symbolic system on the map I'm talking about literally along those lines along the nine dash line there are outposts to signify that that's the border or that no no and again where that so in on the map in 2009 that was submitted to the UN each of the dashes is over 20 kilometers wide so where exactly the boundary is within those 20 kilometers who knows and again none of the dashes match up with previous versions of the map or even with the current Matt if you get a Chinese passport right now there is a nine dash line on the little map of China it does not look like this one it changes based on who you ask and what the year is and it's purposely left and big wasn't vague because then China can claim anything it wants and explain it after the fact right yeah if there were if there were an attempt to to sort of make some sense out of it you would think that that the Chinese would look at as Greg mentioned earlier the very you know Commission law of the sea you know treaty points or convention points that they did agree to in terms of defining Islands they shouldn't reefs rocks etc and then attempt to show we're territorial seas would be figured from that but you don't even have that sort of that that effort alright thank you then where are the most contested territory in the South China Sea so right now the most contested territories are the Spratly Islands in the south and Scarborough Shoal the Paracels have been under exclusive Chinese jurisdiction since 1975 so in the 1950s well immediately after world war ii essentially france reoccupied the Paracel Islands which had been taken over by the Japanese all of these islands were occupied by Japan during World War two when the French left Indochina in the 1950s the Republic of Vietnam maintained Garrison's on about half of them the western half and the Republic of China the Nationalist government occupied the eastern half after the fall of Saigon within months of the fall Saigon the Republic of China garrison I'm sorry at the time by then the PRC garrison since this kind of support over invaded the western half drove the the Republic of Vietnam it's all yourself Vietnamese garrison off they've been in control of that sense so Chinese control the Paracels are pretty well established now for 40 plus years the Spratlys that were hotly contested China occupies seven of the features they most recently occupied mischief reef in 1995 that was the last time anybody occupied something new the Filipinos have eight and Malaysians have five the Vietnamese are tough depending on how you count because they've built multiple outposts on specific reefs they have a 49 different outposts bred across 27 reefs it's been on the way count so it's and a lot of these are within a mile half a mile of each other I mean these guys are staring at each other with binoculars it's it's a powder keg and then Scarborough Shoal is a whole different problem Scarborough Shoal was uncontested Philippine territory as far as anybody knew until 2012 we have multiple documents since the 1940s from US cabinet officials saying that the u.s. recognized Scarborough Shoal is part of the Philippines we controlled it when it was still the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 2012 the Chinese seized control of it as far as we know they never actually claimed it until the 1990s when they kind of added a new name to it and expanded their claim so it's a sore spot for the Filipinos given that it was basically seized six years ago and the Chinese didn't pay any price for it whatsoever and it the only thing I had is the sort of depends what you mean by most contested territories obviously for the US if you think about the two areas where we're talking most contested it really is you know it's this the Spratly holdings of you know so Vietnam Philippines and then Scarborough Shoal the Philippines Philippines is a US ally now behavior of late calls that into question somewhat but they're they're a US ally and and and so that's in many ways makes those those holdings of greatest concern because of I think it's great mentioned earlier the potential requirement for us to come to the Philippine aid you know if something escalated between China and the Philippines there but then also the the Vietnam holdings that are contested as well could could potentially be a powder cake all right thank you briefly what has been done to resolve territorial sea disputes nothing nothing territorial disputes are notoriously tough to resolve we should be realistic all of the claimants should be realistic these disputes are going to be here for generations you know if you look at the history the way the territorial disputes get resolved either through military conquest which obviously we don't want to see happen direct negotiation which is awfully difficult when you have six different countries trying to negotiate over the Spratly Islands or arbitration and the Chinese are not going to go to arbitration any time soon and so there is no legal mechanism that's really going to allow a resolution of the territorial skews elsewhere in Asia you know the Chinese and the Japanese are debating have been debating sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands in the East Tennessee for decades China and Japan still argue over sovereignty over takashima or Dokdo Island and will for a decade so the way this works in age is usually you have a dispute you find ways to get around for 20 30 50 years if you have to that's what's gonna happen here well we need to be worried about is how to manage the dispute over waters and seabed around it so it doesn't spark a conflict as long as we can avoid a conflict over the waters these guys can occupy those reefs for a hundred years and keep staring each other and it's not gonna make much difference mm-hmm yeah I agree I mean I think and I think the problem right now is that you had established perhaps a long-term mechanism for beginning to dissolve those to solve those rasputin's and Gregg might be able to add to this the first is that is that there has been since between Oh - in 2013 the principle mechanism for managing any kind of act you know activities between rival claimants or disputes in the South China Sea was was an associate Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN Declaration on the conduct of parties I guess is the dock the Declaration of conduct not legally binding is just it's just it's but it sets out some principles for dealing with problems in that this past August a framework was agreed to by the ten ASEAN members and China to begin discussions on an actual code of conduct for for the South China Sea the problem is is that just like the doc before the code of conduct at least in the framework there's there's no provision for that to be legally binding so in the absence of something that's legally binding to help resolve sort of the disputes that Greg mentioned that can be dealt with there's a there's a process perhaps maybe there's there's hotlines develop there's other issues but there's nothing that that they that the parties have signed up to legally that says that we will abide by the decisions that are made when these disputes are bought in front of sort of international court or resolved under a code of conduct so even though it's been touted as you know we're advancing toward a code of conduct it's not going to be legally binding the second thing is I still believe the second biggest problem again is Beijing's desire to paint the the problem is one that's that non regional actors are involved in and that's a roundabout way of criticizing the United States and saying that these you know that the we need to deal with it and they should stay out of there and it's greg indicated perfectly that's that's not right that's not going to happen and and then the the the sort of the third thing and i've already mentioned it really is the sort of the idea of the nine dash line or the idea of the expansiveness of the chinese claim it even gets in the way of china being able to bilaterally deal with with the issues that would that would help to lead eventually toward territorial so in the most excessive example the the chinese want to negotiate shared fishing rights with indonesia in that area called the Natuna sea islands if you were sitting in jakarta and you were in an evening of an official why would you want to negotiate shared fishing rights fifty miles off your coast with a country thousand miles away and so the very existence of the nine dash line i think is an affront to these countries right that china is imposing the idea that these waters are disputed on smaller countries where everybody else gets two hundred miles the chinese get a thousand miles and now we all have to negotiate because our stuff lies within a thousand miles of China it is patently absurd nobody signed up to that system until the Chinese started demanding it in 2009 alright thank you we're and we have half an hour left more questions so I'd appreciate if you answer questions on resources in global trade this is part two we're moving into I'm gonna just read all the questions under part two so they can answer it in a joint manner okay yeah so first question is why are the geopolitics of the South China Sea of such significance can you give an audience the breakdown of the regional global economic significance and then next question is one scholar recently noted that the South China Sea is the industrial hub of China how much does that factor of China's growth affect tensions within the waterway next is how much has nationalist the politics especially from the likes of Rodrigo 2:30 in the Philippines contributed to the competition in the South China Sea final question within part 2 is how have other major powers injected themselves into the economic competition over the South China Sea for example United States Russia and India so how about you spend about five minutes yeah I'll jump in first so let me take some of the first two as a bundle economics when it comes to debate over the Susteren see the problem for me because it gets used as a red herring it's a very useful i popping statistic when you read news articles and they say oh you know five point three trillion dollars in trade passes through that's gonna see annually that number is a little inflated but it's closer to three but the point is the south can see is one of the busiest waterways on the planet that's true the Strait of Malacca that runs at the very southern end of that map passing a poor that sees I think the last numbers I saw were four times as much trade as the Panama Canal every year it's second only to the Strait of Hormuz for the amount of oil and gas that passes through you know the the Japanese the Koreans are reliant on shipment through there all of that is true that said it's irrelevant as far as I'm concerned the South China Sea the Chinese are not going to cut off commercial trade through the South China Sea there is relying on is anybody else we're not gonna do it there's this notion that's been kicked around for over twenty years now of the Malacca dilemma the Chinese have been terrified that we or our allies might close the Strait to choke them off in some future conflict but imagine that conflict in which we're willing to cut all sixty percent of Japanese oil and gas shipments to damage the Chinese we're already in World War three we're gonna be not concerned with the Malacca Straits whatsoever there is no reasonable level at which you can kind of cap that kind of escalation and so yes they're big numbers and they're very sexy and they're largely irrelevant any any cut off of commercial traffic for South China Sea would be accidental it would be because somebody's fighting and insurance rates skyrocket and so people decide to kick around and some of my colleagues see if I did a very good study last year on the economic cost of that it would be pretty bad for a couple of weeks but then ships would just start kicking around Australia and it actually doesn't cost as much as you would think it's a few dollars you know per shipment that it actually runs you to kick around Australia and go run Indonesian so yeah it would be it would be extremely damaging to countries like Vietnam but it's not going to matter that much to major global ship-borne traffic what does matter are resources within the South China Sea to those countries and so if you are Vietnam or you are the Philippines you desperately need oil and gas resources the line for South China Sea you desperately need fish latest numbers I have for some like three and a half million Southeast Asians are directly employed in the fishing industry in the South China Sea and that's you know millions more in related industries and so the idea of a fisheries collapse which we're five ten years away from a catastrophic fisheries collapse in the South China Sea be to the boat were fishing those will have major economic impacts but those are economic drivers for the claiming countries they don't matter globally and so when we talk about that I think it often tracks away from the bigger questions which are the questions of the rules and nationalism and you know the trade doesn't matter and it gives the Chinese in easy out because Beijing often says we're not threatening freedom of navigation meaning commercial shipping and so there's no problem here that's that's a straw man argument nobody should be arguing that the Chinese are threatening commercial navigation they're threatening a whole lot of other things the second question on duterte so for those who don't know rodrigo duterte was elected president of the philippines in May 2016 he took office three weeks after the Philippines won their arbitral award against the Chinese which had taken them three years to get to and he immediately shells the disputes that we're not going to talk about this award I'm gonna reach out to the Chinese characters a problem Duterte is his first president the Philippines from Mindanao which is the southernmost island he's rapidly anti-american he's been rapidly anti-american since college when one of his professors was he current head of the Philippine Communist Party he loves Beijing he loves Moscow he often talks about this he he's done everything he can to try a distance the Philippines from the US as a treaty Ally he has found the balance of what is politically acceptable in the Philippines however I mean after decades at the treaty Ally we are the major investor in the Philippines we are the number two trading partner we are the number two investor most Filipinos are pro-american our current administration has higher approval ratings in the Philippines and they do in the US and I mean a lot I think President Johnson Orion is 82 percent in the last poll I saw in the Philippines 90 plus percent of Filipinos support the alliance over 80 percent support a permanent US military presence in the islands the armed force of the Philippines are clearly pro-american which doTERRA tears admitted and so as much as he's trying to pull the Philippines toward China every time he does he gets pushed back and so doTERRA day is a problem he shouldn't be used as a as an excuse on the US side which is how I worry he's being treated in Washington there are not a lot of Philippine experts in Washington as you can imagine doTERRA Tate's there's a lot of ridiculous crazy sings in the press he does a lot of America bashing but the Alliance is about a lot more than Rodrigo Duterte you know we have an alliance between the people of the United States and the people the Philippines not with their president and so he's gonna be a pain for the next few years but it's it's no excuse to abrogate our legal and moral commitment I would just agree with completely with everything Gregg said I'd add on sort of the the economic certainly it's not the industrial hub of China except that it brings materials necessary materials into China which again means that they're not gonna threaten that but but because of that China does see the South China Sea a strategic water and and you know sort of looking further down the road China is doing toward toward regional preeminence let's say let's say it's not necessarily regional dominance I pick your word but looking down the road of regional preeminence in Asia the nationalist card and also just to control if you will the de facto control of strategic territory and it is strategic water for several reasons you know is important and and so it maintains it's important to to Beijing for that for that reason and they're willing to at least purportedly willing to negotiate in good faith about joint exploration of all of the the potential minerals fisheries you know the energy resources if they can even be gotten to and potentially in the future they will and certainly it's a concern so I think they're there they're willing potentially to talk about those things bilaterally with the countries in the region and are doing so with the Philippines with Malaysia but in to some extent with Vietnam but it you know the idea that the acceptance of Chinese sovereignty is the key before any of this you know really become you know comes to fruition is the issue and I think that's you know that's worth keeping in mind the nationalist politics you know agree with Greg on Duterte that the concern I have is that you know again how much how much potential damage can be done despite the fact that many of his military many of advisers that many of the Philippine people are not necessarily gonna go down the road he wants to go down with China to what extent can damage be done during the time that he's in charge he joked just this week ER or late last week that Philippines you know could could could become a Province of China the Republic of China might use the wrong word I think I think he and again even as a joke that's right now in in the region kind of you know not terribly helpful so again I think that the issue there is that that he's helping to propagate a little bit this this narrative from Beijing that China's actions there they're greater assertiveness in the South China Sea is somehow justified by US presence or US activity he propagates that he buys it and puts it out and it's a again I don't necessarily think other leaders or other people or other you know a strategic level thinkers in the region agree with that but it you know any kind of buying into that narrative I think in the region is is unhelpful the better thing would would again be sort of morph more muscular backlash against the militarization of features in the South China Sea and and more you know sort of standing up to Beijing and saying we've got to get you know a good code of conduct in place we have to you know we have to to make sure that that we that we reduce the likelihood of escalation or conflict in the South China Sea other powers injected themselves right you can on the right a petition you know to some extent it's it's interesting to see India and Japan and the activities that that they're involved in and in the South China Sea India's involvement with Vietnam I won't go into a lot of detail but there's a quite an important quadrennial defense dialogue between between the US Australia India and Japan and it has obviously some impact on on on the South China Sea and the activities of those nations there and and they increasingly are playing roles you know the Japan providing Coast Guard vessels to the Philippines etc so there there is activity by other actors that generally speaking I think supports overall what the what the US would like to see in terms of responding to the Chinese activity Russia on the other hand again is willing to you know does does train an exercise with the with the PRC with with China and I guess has done some joint training recently they've done summits in the South China Sea area some joint naval activity well they have that up there but I think they've also done a little bit in South China Sea Russia is willing to get involved you know again not completely sure what all the intricacies of their ultimate objectives in that are but it is it is supporting Beijing in an area where Beijing clearly is is at odds with the US and Russia see some advantage in that all right thank you let's move on to part three final part the military since early in this decade China has actively been constructing artificial islands with military installations in South China Sea can you discuss where these islands are strategically located how they are from militarily equipped we have about five slides so the Chinese in the Spratly Islands were late comers they didn't occupy anything until nineteen by which time all of the good real estate was already taken by the Vietnamese Philippines and the Malaysians so what the Chinese occupy our underwater reefs or at least reefs that are almost entirely underwater I've had a rock that stick up here and there which means that if you were the Chinese and you wanted to build anything of military significance you had to expand these what the Chinese started doing in late 2013 is exactly that they brought out these massive dredging ships where they would stick hard pipes down onto the coral break it up suck it up and spray it out of hose on the other end until it piled up and formed an artificial island it's you've ever seen the way they truck in sand for the Outer Banks in North Carolina every year after storms that times 100 except you're doing in the middle of the ocean then you build retaining walls around the whole thing flatten it out and start building military they've now done this at all seven of their islands this one that you're seeing is mischief reef mister freef is particularly worrying to the Filipinos it's the closest one to the Philippines it's the last one that was occupied 1995 it's about 20 miles from a group of Filipino Marines who were stationed at second Thomas shoal so it's worrying to them and to give you a scope of the scale the entire the kind of the rim there that they built on that is roughly the same size as the i-495 Beltway around Washington so all of DC within the Beltway could fit in the lagoon of that island it's pretty big the entire left side that you're seeing there is a runway that's a 3,000 meter run awake and launch or land anything short of a space shuttle at least anything in the Chinese Arsenal and so they now have not just the runway they've built at this facility 24 fighter jet hangars and another for very big hangars for bombers refueling tankers AWACS things like that identical deployments at the other three of their biggest ones so total you're talking about potentially 72 combat aircraft along with more than a dozen large aircraft this is not a civilian facility the Chinese like to say they've built this to do you know fishermen shelters and provide civilian services they might be doing that too but this is a military base and it is absurd to argue that anything else it has advanced point defenses 100 millimeter guns at each of those cardinal points got massive radar in signals intelligence facilities nothing moves in the South China Sea anymore without the Chinese knowing about it and that includes US assets this is fiery cross reef the red is what they built just last year so it's not as if this is stopped or slowed down it is probably the intelligence collection hub for the entire Spratly Islands all that red stuff at the very North there those are all ray domes and massive HF radar facilities they've got huge underground storage for ammunition fuel water they've got let's see mobile missile shelters I mean this has everything you need to threaten your neighbors and subi reef the last of the big three which is just 12 miles from the two island which is the biggest of the Philippine occupied Islands where the Filipinos have between 100 and 200 civilians living on any given day and so if you're a Filipino civilian there which includes by the way in elementary school I mean this is mainly bureaucrats their families if you look out to the east you see the lighthouse from subi reef reminding you that the Chinese are just over the horizon every time the Filipinos come in to land at their airstrip there on that island they get worn by the Chinese at they're entering Chinese airspace including when the Defense Secretary landed and in the summer and so all of this is built with the goal of establishing Chinese dominance over the South China Sea what you often hear from I think some non experts on this who take a look who don't realize how big it is and it's very little more scope subi reef when I get showed you it's as big as the entire Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Honolulu at least all of Pearl Harbor can fit within the lagoon so these are enormous facilities people will often say well you know the US could handle these in a conflict and you're right they're only survivable for days maybe weeks if the Chinese are lucky that's not the point if you're the Filipinos or the Vietnamese or the Malaysians the Chinese can have fighter jets over your capital in a matter of hours they can have assets over your islands in 15 minutes and there is probably no US asset closer than Sasebo in Japan or Guam unless we happen to have an aircraft carrier in the region and so in peacetime these are an implicit threat to all of China's neighbors yeah the only thing I'd add to that and again from from the perspective of someone who's who's been a u.s. planner in the military is that yeah there you'll hear about their vulnerability of these features they are yes they're vulnerable but if you're a military planner and you have to think what do I have to do if I have to you know if I have to come to the Philippines I something's escalating in the South China Sea and we have you know we have limited you know ordnance to deal with you know with a rising military power like China in any conflict I mean suddenly in addition to having to deal with you know with Asia's largest Navy in a navy that's becoming increasingly more capable by the day building the second largest and most capable destroyer in the world after our own zumwalt-class you can't afford to waste ordnance and and you don't need additional planning vectors to think about how do I deal with China if they've managed to extend their air defense umbrella you know from the mainland from Woody Allen from the Paracels South even if it's only for a short period of time before you're able to neutralize that the amount of ordnance required to do that the planning factors when you have to think about doing that these are not insignificant features at all they are you know they are they're a big concern to military planners and should be and as Gregg pointed out even more importantly because none of us want to be at the point where we're actually having to think about that we pay people to plan for that but none of us want to go there but even below that threshold of major conflict the Chinese strategy right now is to stay below that threshold and it's to use their Coast Guard to use their maritime militia civilian craft ostensibly and in paramilitary backed up by Navy grey holes to to increase their presence on on a daily weekly monthly basis these facilities allow them to do that have a pretty significant in the South China Sea that can be logistically supported that has has better better communications better you know intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to give them situational awareness in those seas so it is very important all right thank you we have about 15 minutes left well probably five questions perhaps I can ask you guys to answer these questions at the same time so next question number 14 is is this as defense posture by China who fear encirclement from the United States and allies or share ambition in the region and then how have Association of Southeast Asian countries reacted military militarily to Chinese activity and then China has marginally surpassed the United States in the South China Sea does the construction of these island bases change the strategies dynamic between the two great powers if so how again there was this I think each one of these questions will have a slide I think I'll stop here too early just for you guys to answer those three questions at one time so I'll jump to the last one first or maybe the next last one does have sea as China actually established at least temporary dominance an edge over the US when it comes to the South China Sea militarily not yet I mean that that is clearly overblown when it comes to our surface assets and our sub surface assets we're clearly dominant and they have not deployed combat aircraft to those islands yet it's a matter of when not if for the time being they they haven't and you know there is a US Navy ship in the port of Manila any day any given day of the year I I haven't seen number from last year I think 2015 we had a hundred and eighty port calls in the Philippines and so if you assume a ship doesn't just stay for a day that's way more than one day a year and so we've always got something there we have a pretty robust presence in sauce going to see the trend is worrying though and my biggest concern is when they do start operating these air bases which i think is a matter of months it's really a political decision from Beijing at this point everything you need to do it's in place when they do it's not going to be enough to keep the u.s. out of the South China Sea it'll impose a cost on us and especially in a wider conflict in which we're about defending Taipei in Tokyo we probably don't have a lot of effort to spend in the South China Sea but more immediately it fundamentally undermines our treaty commitment to the Philippines because if you imagine a scenario in which the Chinese decides they're going to say take out Philippine ship in the South China Sea or blockade and try to starve out the Filipino Marines that are on second Thomas shoal as they try to do in 2014 and they have air assets 15 minutes away and we have nothing closer than Guam we do not have a credible commitment you cannot fake forward presence and so they are going to get to a place I worry where the Philippines politically is going to find it very difficult to rationalize standing up to Beijing even with US commitments cuz even if we said we have your back we don't at least not quick enough to save those Marines and so that fundamentally shifts the balance of power not today but pretty soon yeah I agree with that I mean this is a slide so my colleagues worked on if you want to delve more into it go online and look up US military scorecard and it'll talk about different areas regions and contingencies you know it looks pretty good if you if you like green and and and you know it's mostly green still but but the point is it's you know it's it's it's not all green and it's changing over time and and and the issue I think it's great pointed out is that is that you know China's talking about a home game in many respects and and and the issues involved in in sort of being able to project power to defend allies across the globe really really requires being able to dominate at the point of conflict at the particular points that that are that are under dispute and that's and that's you know again a very very difficult and increasingly difficult thing for us to for us to do and it's about and it's about airspace as well as remember that it's about airspace as much as it is maybe not as much but almost as much as it is about about the maritime surface and and and so you know the things that they're putting out in these facilities and potentially can do with their Navy and their Coast Guard to reinforce what's on those little pieces of land is a big concern alright thank you let's move on to the last three questions what do you think the United States to Asia especially Trump administration's most recent redeployment of forces mean for the future of South China Sea and then 17 November the Harvard Kennedy School Graham Allison spoke at the Nixon Library in his talk he Illustrated how a simple freedom of navigation operation conducted by the United States Navy could erupt into a full-scale war in the context of the South China Sea are the US and China on a tragic trajectory toward war it reminds me of Chinese President Xi Jinping who says there were a thousand reasons for United States and China's get along how do you answer this quite these two questions I'll start with with Graham Allison's piece a grand malleson framed his recent book around the the famous safety strap which the writer of the Peloponnesian War and the idea that a sense in Sparta were doomed to conflict and that's the same way the US and China are doomed to conflict and I don't buy it I find it oversimplified and to be fair that's a gross oversimplification of Graham's argument too but the argument that you often hear filtering through the region and even in policy disputed policy debates here in Washington is one the chairs that defeatism the idea that because say a fond off in which a u.s. ship asserts that we have certain rights here and sail through the nine-dash line despite China's objections at that could trigger conflict means that the only reasonable thing to do is to surrender you know raise the white flag the Chinese want it more we're gonna go home I think that misunderstands US interest here I think it misunderstands the ripple effect of allowing China to basically take what it wants from its neighbors just cuz it's big and they're not what that means for the entire post-war system that has preserved peace and stability globally for the most part for you know 75 years and I think it's just blatantly false so the Chinese time and again over the last few years when presented with the choice to use military force or back down have backed down and this is not from the US alone the Japanese have done the theory successfully run the Senkakus since Elise 2012 in 2014 when the Chinese deployed an oil rig to dispute a water with Vietnam said it was gonna be there for three months the Vietnamese sent hundreds of fishing boats ramming and bumping with Chinese Coast Guard and fishermen the Chinese accidentally sunk one and got so scared because they jumped dozen Vietnamese fishermen in the water and very nearly killed them on global television that they pulled out a month early haven't brought the rig back since the Filipinos that same year when the Chinese Institute of blockade of their Marines on the sierra madre with a ship they have at second time michelle the chinese tried to starve them out Filipinos started doing air drops of food and water for about two months and then they loaded a civilian boat full of not just supplies but also journalists and had it run the blockade and we had a p8 overhead to let the Chinese know that we were watching and the Chinese let it go lifted the blockade the next day haven't reinstituted in the last four years the point being the Chinese do not want conflict they feel that they can get what they want without it they can get what they want by bullying and threats and so far we've been batting about 500 but that's not good enough because you know they only have to get away with it once and they've changed the status quo and we have to successfully deter them every single time and being successful 50% of the time it's not working yeah I agree we're not on a trajectory towards a war in the in the South China Sea I'm much more worried about much more worried about Taiwan and I don't necessarily think that any you know theory of international relations can can determine whether that will go the wrong direction or not there's just too many factors involved but I'm much more worried about about Taiwan over over the next five to eight to ten years then I have about the South China Sea but as Gregg said if we aren't thinking pretty frequently clearly and then putting thinking into action about proportional responses to Chinese activity then then you know then we're basically ceding the the field there you know I don't have time to go into a lot of details about what some of these specific things can be the one that obviously makes the news the most are our freedom of navigation operations which are Greg and I were talking earlier or or horribly mischaracterize generally speaking in the in the media but they're very important and they can be used in a variety of ways and and need to be but there are other options as well that we can do in terms of training exercises with partners in the region a relationship with Vietnam is very important in this regard in which direction we go with that again interesting to be sitting in the library here at this time and then talking about that but it's a it's important in terms of how we choose to to partner with Vietnam and certain things which capabilities we potentially help them to build even without us there certainly building some some capabilities to respond to Chinese activities that that I think will be will be will be helpful in terms of responded to what what's going on in South China Sea all right thank you last question this is certainly in the tradition of President Nixon who ended Vietnam War and brokered peace with China the question is in your opinion what can US policymakers and actors do just like Nixon did to defuse tensions in the region I imagine we both have a laundry list of things they said look the first the big picture problem here is that the US needs to do a better job communicating our interests clearly and especially under the current administration with the hyper focus on North Korea which is literally sucking all the air out of the positive in Washington people can't focus on anything but really is important it's today's crisis you can't ignore tomorrow's crisis though you have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time we need to be doing a better job communicating how much this matters tell us make it clear that we do have interest here and we're not gonna walk away from them number two is we need to shore up our alliance with the Philippines if you lose the Philippines here you lose the South China Sea period you can't do it for them you can't go in and insist that they defend their own rights and the problem with Duterte is that he is already predisposed to believe that we are unreliable he says time and again that is foolish of the Filipinos to believe that the US will actually defend them we need to make clear that that is not foolish and the first thing we should do is issue with public clarification that our mutual defense treaty does apply in substance we did this in 2013 President Obama was in Tokyo made a big speech in which he said listen Kaku Islands apply which is the Japanese dispute with the Chinese and we very purposely haven't said that for the Filipinos and so ever since that day Philippine governments have been saying why is it that you gave the Japanese a guarantee you won't give to us that's a fair question and we need to recognize that doTERRA tea or no duterte we have fundamental interests here and one of them is to shore up that alliance if we don't do that the Filipinos are not going to follow through with plans to allow forward deployment of US assets which as I said earlier you need to have assets closer than Guam the only way we can do it is to put them in the Philippines and the only way the dictators gonna let us do that if we make it clear that we're actually going to use them to defend Filipino troops yeah I agree completely with oh there's a great points and I mentioned briefly min ago sort of these these ideas of proportional responses it would it would predominately be military because they would involve military forces as the as the principle tool of sort of being in China's face and making sure they understand the risk and I think that actually over time diffuses tensions again it the potential for escalation is certainly there but that's important but I think bottom line is is that the real tools here are non-military and we're seeing nations now and I will I won't publicly here take a stand on whether we're throwing from the trans-pacific partnership was a bad or a good thing happy to talk about it offline but but but we haven't replaced that with a vision of economic leadership in the region to this point you know yet and and regional actors are now negotiating what it looks like without the United States that that's not good and that's that's the that's the problem is that you know for if we're going to defuse tensions in the region and and and maintain our status as the you know the principal arbiter of stability peace and progress in the region you know again we have to make sure that the clear message of leadership is there all right thank you very much these are very informative answers constitute a great repertoire of information about this very important issue is it globally watched and unfollowed so we do have a few minutes actually two minutes perhaps we could extend a few minutes to have a few a couple of questions here I've got a microphone I'll come to you I've got a microphone right here we'll use okay first of all I wanted to say thank you very much great great informative session the thing that as a former military guy I kind of understand everything here but I kind of also say that what we are not talking about if I were the head of the PRC I'd be coming up with the same strategy it's a brilliant strategy I've read somewhere where they're growing 20 million people a year since the early 90s I've got this huge growing body I've got all these aspirations I need all this so I've got the one belt road I've know it's the nine dash line here I'm infiltrating as much as I can throughout Africa and we're talking here like next ten years we need to counter them and do this and do that they're looking 50 years from now what this is what this what is this map gonna look like 50 years from now and no one there's no sheriff in town I can tell you the United States of America is not going to go over there after Vietnam and after the global war on terror and after the complacency we have in this country there's no appetite for what is happening over there we don't care people like you and I and the people in this room we care but the Americans don't care and so you're not gonna be able to go over there and counter them in any way and I think it's gonna be one say 50 years from now they're gonna say hey this is our lake stay the hell out and this way it's going to be and we're gonna say yes sir three bags full and sue me the same way as Taiwan and all the other little small countries around there gonna be there's no other recourse that's kind of what I see this thing if I were the head of the PRC I'd be coming up with the same strategy yeah I'll make comments on that I think I wanted to thank you for your questions and answers very good my question is to counteract the military presence over there is there talk about possibly open it up Clark Air Force Base again in the Philippines last question if you'd please expand your focus to North Korea could you just comment on to whether we can trust the Chinese to help us in that situation I'd be very interested all right I'll go quick last one last I I don't I person I don't have time I have interesting to answer your question but probably don't have time so if you want to see me afterwards I can talk a little bit about that with you I'd love to on the other one you we are using Clark some I don't know how long before I let Greg hit on PRC grand strategy their strategy in the South China Sea is is I assume a component of their or their grand strategy which is to be a major global power roughly by 2049 and to extend the advantages of the economic miracle that has been seen on the Chinese coast to expand it into the hinterlands and actually improve the improve the living conditions of all Chinese even in that even in the inter lands is really the division and it's it's a great vision where I have difficulty understand what I have difficulty understanding is that the Chinese leadership you know at the elite in the Chinese Communist Party really seem to have backed themselves into corners in certain areas specifically when it comes to sovereignty claims Taiwan being the foremost but the South China Sea is China Sea and a few remaining continental land border issues as well with India you know seems to have back themselves into a corner those things if they do in fact escalate and and they do they do speak to sort of the the rules-based global order that the US has championed and and and which has enabled China to economically grow over the last few decades you know it it calls into question that order and and and I think you indicated the idea that probably that that that order may be dead and we need to to accept it but it you know again I think that we need to we need to not give up so easily and I think the point needs to be made whenever it can through us leadership that that this has benefited this the the global you know order has benefited China and can continue to benefit China as they grow as a as a global power there's there again there's not this idea that the u.s. is containing China is is in the Chinese mind for predominantly there are probably a quite a few Americans who may entertain that as well but it has never been US policy to contain China's rise so I just see that a lot of these things that are happening are you know that that the PRC leadership is kind of back themselves into a corner and has to be feels like they it perceives they have to be hardline about when in fact again I think u.s. global leadership should continue to reach this idea you know of a global order we're both big countries and small countries can can advance their interests so real quick on on Clark and I mean a bigger question about the the US presence Philippines so we do use Clark those who don't remember we got kicked out of our bases and Subic Naval Base and and Clark Air Base in the mid 90s we subsequently signed a busy enforces agreement with the Philippines so we do have rotational access we fly pH regularly out of Clark and sometimes out of places like Perth the princess and palawan we do a lot of big military exercises where we'll bring in combat aircraft in Clark but all of this is at a relatively small scale actually by 2020 we might very well lose all access to Clark because right now it's being built up into the second major civilian hubs that got the civilian airport there that might very well lose us our access to resolve this problem in 2014 we signed an enhanced defense cooperation agreement with the Philippines which was finally doing the constitutional inside and you know finalized in 2016 the idea behind this was that the u.s. military would build up facilities and five agreed-upon Philippine vases we would then be used by both sides and so we would build hangars and help do runway improvements and and you know forward deploy ammunition all these things to allow us to do rotational deployments on larger scales of combat aircraft and patrol aircraft and things like that specifically geared not just to where the South China Sea but also toward humanitarian assistance you know for the next major typhoon that hits and the counter-terror cooperation we had in southern Philippines all of that is up in the air post due today and so we're still moving forward at a snail's pace on a couple of those locations we're not doing the things we will need to actually have rotational deployments and so what I worry about is in 2020 we're gonna wake up and find that because we weren't really paying attention we lost our access to Clark and we didn't implement the enhanced defense cooperation agreement enough and so again we don't have anything closer than Guam when the Chinese are you know 5060 miles off the Philippine coast all right thank you very much thank you [Applause]"
QyFqZfnLcXQ,Philippines checking if Chinese boat fired at fishermen,"Philippine officials have been verifying reports that Chinese sea patrollers fired warning shots at a Filipino fishing boat in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin told GMA News on Friday that the reported shots in the area – which Manila calls the West Philippine Sea -- were ""a cause of grave concern.""

He said in a text message that although authorities ""have not received any report yet,"" the incident would be concerning “if indeed this happened.""

The comments come after a boat operator based in the western island province of Palawan claimed that one of his vessels had been fired at near the Mabini reef, an area being reclaimed by China, last Saturday. The fishermen onboard had reportedly been forced to flee the area.

China claims almost the whole of the resource-rich South China Sea, while several other Asian nations including Vietnam and the Philippines have also laid claim.

The U.S. and the Philippines have recently been expressing increasing concern amid Beijing's reported massive island creation projects atop previously submerged reefs, which have raised concerns among members of the international community who are wary of their impact on freedom of navigation.

The Philippines has protested the construction projects, calling them violations of the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, to which China is a signatory.

Admiral Alexander Lopez, Western Command commander, also told local media that the incident last weekend has not been verified.

""We have no report from them [fishermen]. If ever you have a contact with the allegedly involved fishermen, please tell them to report to us, so we can assess the allegations,"" he added.

Meanwhile, army public affairs chief Lt. Col. Harold Cabunoc said the military would coordinate with the Philippine coast guard “to ascertain the veracity of the report about the alleged harassment by Chinese authorities.""

According to the boat operator, Pasi Abdulfatah, the fishermen had not reported the occurrence as they were accustomed to such disturbances by Chinese vessels.

In April, Filipino fishermen claimed that Chinese Coast Guard patrolmen had driven them out of the region's Scarborough Shoal with water cannon, while a boat captain said that armed Chinese officers had boarded boats and confiscated catch.",0,philippine officials have been verifying reports that chinese see patrollers fired warning shots at a Filipino fishing boat in disputed waters of the South China Sea defense secretary Voltaire gazmin told GMA news on Friday that the reported shots in the area which Manila calls the West Philippine Sea were a cause of grave concern he said in a text message that although authorities have not received any report yet the incident would be concerning if indeed this happened the comments come after a boat operator based in the western island province of Palawan claimed that one of his vessels had been fired at near the many reef an area being reclaimed by China last Saturday the fisherman on board had reportedly been forced to flee the area China claims almost the whole of the resource-rich South China Sea while several other Asian nations including Vietnam and the Philippines have also laid claim the US and the Philippines have recently been expressing increasing concern amid beatings reported massive island creation projects atop previously submerged reefs which have raised concerns among members of the international community who are weary of their impact on freedom of navigation the Philippines has protested the construction projects calling them violations of the 2002 AC on China Declaration on the conduct of parties in the South China Sea to which China is a signatory Admiral Alexander Lopez Western Command commander also told local media that the incident last weekend has not been verified we have no report from them fishermen if ever you have a contact with the allegedly involved fishermen please tell them to report to us so we can assess the allegations he added meanwhile Army Public Affairs Chief LT Co L Herald cabinet said the military would coordinate with the Philippine Coast Guard to ascertain the veracity of the report about the alleged harassment by Chinese authorities according to the boat operator pacy abdul fattah the fishermen had not reported the occurrence as they were accustomed to such disturbances by Chinese vessels in April Filipino fishermen that Chinese coastguard patrolman had driven them out of the region Scarborough Shoal with water cannon while a boat captain said that armed Chinese officers had boarded boats and confiscated catch
s3pkn9vqCZY,China Says Arbitral Tribunal Has No Jurisdiction over South China Sea Case,"The Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the South China Sea case and relevant subject-matters and should not hear the case and render an award, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Thursday.

""The Philippines' unilateral initiation of arbitration has breached the international law, betrayed the bilateral agreement between the two countries that conflicts should be resolved through bilateral negotiation, and violated its commitment in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which is to resolve conflicts through dialogue between the directly involved parties. It has also abused the international law and the international arbitration system,"" said Hong.

China and the Philippines have agreed, through a series of bilateral instruments and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, to settle their South China Sea disputes through bilateral negotiation. On 22 January 2013, the Philippines unilaterally initiated the arbitration on the relevant disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea. The Chinese government immediately declared that it would neither accept nor participate in the arbitration initiated by the Philippines 

Hong said the subject-matters of the arbitration constitute an integral part of maritime delimitation between China and the Philippines, thus falling within the scope of the declaration made by China in 2006 pursuant to Article 298 of UNCLOS, which excludes disputes concerning maritime delimitation, among others, from arbitration and other compulsory dispute settlement procedures. 

""The Arbitral Tribunal, taking no regard of the fact that China and the Philippines have chosen to settle disputes through negotiation and consultation and the fact that the essence of the subject-matters of the arbitration is territorial sovereignty, circumvented the optional exceptions declaration China has made in accordance with UNCLOS, expanded and exceeded its jurisdiction at will, and pushed forward the hearing on relevant subject-matters. Such acts have infringed on the right of a state party to UNCLOS to choose means of dispute settlement of its own will, and undermined the integrity of the UNCLOS dispute settlement regime,"" said the spokesperson.

""With regard to territorial issues and maritime delimitation disputes, China does not accept any means of third party dispute settlement or any solution imposed on China,"" he continued.

He also said that the Chinese government will continue to abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and will continue to work with states directly concerned to resolve the relevant disputes in the South China Sea through negotiation and consultation on the basis of respecting historical facts and in accordance with international law, so as to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.

T4oKwXKwz6o,China's manmade islands in the SCS are vulnerable to attack and worthless in a war.,"China's manmade islands in the South China Sea are vulnerable to attack and worthless in a war.
The artificial islands China has built in the South China Sea are vulnerable to attack and unlikely to contribute much to any combat mission, a Chinese military magazine has warned.

China has been transforming the reefs and atolls it occupies on the disputed Spratly Islands since 2015, turning them into artificial islands. It has also built airstrips and other military facilities and deployed equipment such as anti-aircraft guns and close-in weapons systems, according to the US think tank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

These moves heightened fears among rival South China Sea claimants such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which fear the military build-up could allow Beijing to attack warplanes or shoot down missiles from the facilities

But an article in the latest edition of Naval and Merchant Ships, a Beijing-based monthly magazine, highlighted the artificial islands' weaknesses in four areas: their distance from the mainland, small size, the limited capacity of their airstrips and the multiple routes by which they could be attacked.
The magazine, published by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, which builds ships for the Chinese navy, also warned that they had yet to achieve any significant offensive capabilities.

""These artificial islands have unique advantages in safeguarding Chinese sovereignty and maintaining a military presence in the deep ocean, but they have natural disadvantages in self-defence,"" said the article.

The magazine said the islands were deep in the South China Sea and far from the Chinese mainland. It also warned there was no coherent chain connecting them, so it would be difficult to provide support if one came under attack.

""Take the example of the Fiery Cross Reef. It has a runway now, but it's 1,000km (600 miles) away from Sanya city in Hainan province."" The distance means that China's fastest combat support ships would need more than 20 hours to reach the island.


The article also argued that the islands were too far away to deploy the J-16, China's most advanced multi-role strike fighter, effectively. The fighters could not patrol the area because of the distance and could be easily intercepted or attacked by surface ships.

It continued that most of the islands only had one runway and did not have the space to provide the facilities to support more than one aircraft at a time.

In the event of conflict, this means that a plane unloading or refuelling would have to stay on the runway at all times, preventing other planes from using it.

The airstrips are also close to the ocean, and the article said this left them exposed to damage from tides and tropical weather.
The magazine also said the artificial islands were too small to survive major attacks. Most of the islands are flat and have very limited vegetation or rocks.

This means there is little cover against an attack and the best the Chinese military can do to protect equipment and supplies is build defensive shelters out of materials like steel — which has to be transported from the mainland and cannot withstand a sustained missile barrage.

The article also warned that nearby islands were held by rival claimants, and said that if the US supported allies such as the Philippines or Malaysia in any conflict, the were multiple approaches from which it could attack — such as the Philippine island of Palawan, to the east of the Spratlys, or the Strait of Malacca to the west.",0,china's man-made islands in the south china sea are vulnerable to attack and worthless in a war the artificial islands china has built in the south china sea are vulnerable to attack and unlikely to contribute much to any combat mission a chinese military magazine has warned china has been transforming the reefs and atolls it occupies on the disputed spratly islands since 2015 turning them into artificial islands it has also built airstrips and other military facilities and deployed equipment such as anti-aircraft guns and close-in weapon systems according to the u.s think tank the center for strategic and international studies these moves heightened fears among rival south china sea claimants such as vietnam and the philippines which fear the military buildup could allow beijing to attack warplanes or shoot down missiles from the facilities but an article in the latest edition of naval and merchant ships a beijing-based monthly magazine highlighted the artificial islands weaknesses in four areas their distance from the mainland small size the limited capacity of their airstrips and the multiple routes by which they could be attacked the magazine published by the china state shipbuilding corporation which builds ships for the chinese navy also warned that they had yet to achieve any significant offensive capabilities these artificial islands have unique advantages in safeguarding chinese sovereignty and maintaining a military presence in the deep ocean but they have natural disadvantages in self-defense said the article the magazine said the islands were deep in the south china sea and far from the chinese mainland it also warned there was no coherent chain connecting them so it would be difficult to provide support if one came under attack take the example of the fiery cross reef it has a runway now but it's one thousand kilometers six hundred miles away from sanya city in hainan province the distance means that china's fastest combat support ships would need more than 20 hours to reach the island the article also argued that the islands were too far away to deploy the j-16 china's most advanced multi-role strike fighter effectively the fighters could not patrol the area because of the distance and could be easily intercepted or attacked by surface ships it continued that most of the islands only had one runway

vidgQk-ZMi4,Former Philippine Official Says China Welcomes Philippine Envoy for Talks in Beijing,"China has welcomed former Philippine President Fidel Ramos as a special envoy of the Philippine President for talks in Beijing, said Rafael Alunan III, former interior and local government secretary of the Philippines on Friday. 

Alunan made the statement at a press conference after accompanying Ramos in having dinner with senior Chinese official Fu Ying in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Ramos also attended the press conference. 

Commenting on the meeting between Fidel Ramos and Fu Ying, Alunan said the meeting was ""a good start in breaking the ice"" in the bilateral relations. 

""They met in a friendly atmosphere. They discussed in their private capacity the way forward in the spirit of universal brotherhood and sisterhood for peace and cooperation between the two countries. Their informal discussions focused on the need to engage in further talks, to build trust and confidence, to reduce tensions, to pave the way for overall cooperation for the benefit of both their peoples and the region,"" he said. 

Stressing the importance of building trust for the long-term relationship between the two countries, he said the two sides valued the long history of friendship of the two neighboring countries and the prospect of further cooperation for the sake of future generations. 

""China has welcomed former president Ramos to come to Beijing as a special envoy of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Former President Ramos, as an icebreaker, expressed the Philippine government's desire to hold formal discussions with the Chinese government on issues of mutual concern and interest at the appropriate time to explore pathways to peace and cooperation,"" said Alunan. 

The countries improved ties during Ramos' presidential term from 1992 to 1998. 

Ramos began a five-day visit to Hong Kong on Monday in a bid to seek to rekindle bilateral ties jeopardized by an arbitration case initiated by former Philippine president Benigno Aquino III. 

Fu, former vice-minister of foreign affairs, served as China's ambassador to the Philippines from 1998 to 2000.

vsq6HvP3Ti0,How China Seeks To Win Over 'Strong And Friendly Leaders' And The Local Pushback,"New Delhi: What is China's engagement strategy with the Philippines, how has Beijing adapted its Belt and Road development initiative with Manila, why did President Rodrigo Duterte choose the Chinese to fund certain projects when better alternatives were available, what are the consequences and the pushback locally and why do ruling powers accept China’s secrecy and protection clauses? Dr Alvin Camba, Incoming Assistant Professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver discusses these issues and his paper, published in a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace body of research on Chinese engagement in seven regions—Africa, Central Asia, Latin America, West Asia, the Gulf and North Africa, the Pacific, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. He's in conversation with StratNews Global Associate Editor Amitabh P. Revi.

and welcoming from washington dc dr alvin kamba is the incoming assistant professor at the joseph korbel school of international studies at the university of uh of denver dr kampa thank you so much for your time well um thank you for having me dr gamma just looking at your uh latest uh writings with carnegie and we wanted to just uh you to elaborate on that the philippines uh the china development model and how you know china adapts to local elites okay so um so the paper that i wrote it's about how there's an assumption that china imposes a model on let's say those countries on the receiving governments that they have to follow um you know what china does when it comes to construction contracts when it comes to foreign investment and you know local elites don't have power in the sort of like you know it's assumption so i you know i i make an intervention by saying that it's not the case if we look at the case of china in the philippines um the chinese had to accommodate the legal therapist like uh wishes uh particularly in expediting the project and rewarding local elites now this departs from the assumption that duterte is simply a puppet of china far from it i think more than a puppet he is a rational actor um pursuing his goals and you know giving up something for other things now what they didn't give up in my in my in my view at the start at the start of the administration very very clearly he did not enforce the um the arbitration award that was one by the people's administration in exchange he was able to access foreign investment and construction contacts from the chinese government which in my view he used with he used to reward local elites now um this is very different from the idea that duterte is simply a puppet of china or in the in the words of filipinos he's a puppy he's a small puppy following the master i i don't agree with that i feel like he's a very rational actor that pursues his goals and knows what he wants and he knows the opportunity and he takes advantage of everything so being a rational actor since we're talking about president duterte he's looking at maximizing his political gain within his tenure which is still next year unless of course he takes he gets another one or his um daughter steps in right uh yeah so there um you know in 1986 because of the ferdinand marcos like a dictatorship uh philippine elites and officers and civil society was like okay we'll stop uh presidential becoming too powerful by imposing a limb at their limit so all presidents can only be uh president for one term but you know political power goes beyond that you don't need to be the president to actually have power and influence and if he gets his daughter in office and that's already enough power already like in my view right now when you're looking at the chinese development model and you're saying that president duterte in this example the philippines is not a puppet of the chinese establishment or entities or banks or the state or owned enterprises but how does that negotiation happen in terms of the opaqueness of the chinese deals interest rates you know labor wages charges sure um there i mean um so my argument is not to say that there is no chinese model there is a chinese model the question for me is like what are the requirements for which parameters are non-negotiable for the chinese and which parameters are negotiable now an important part of the chinese model and this is an argument i make in my distribution many other neighbors is they make a relationship to the political elite in power and they limit relationships with either opposition elites especially the ones really against the government and civil society actors now as a result of that we concentrate their relationship on the political elite and power so in the case of like the philippines duterte um in the case of malaysia in 2009 2018 it was najib now it's johor jokowi with other indonesia now the model um it's a lot more freer in terms of like constraints it doesn't have a lot of constraints unlike in my view western uh western loans and multinational development banks nonetheless there are constraints so for instance um interest rates are higher usually for the chinese chinese banks um they they want to put some constraints on information uh flow such as the non-disclosure agreements um meaning the contracts cannot be divulged to the public or ended by the for six months to one year and um the most important thing the contracts and the deals have to be only negotiated with the chinese government and they cannot be restructured or renegotiated by another third party this is what we know as the paris laws which is like very common in international development banks um mainly because they created this like cross to prevent power imbalances between a following country and in the lender so the chinese government doesn't want any of that and they're in in the chinese banks the way they work would be like well you you deal with these things you know non-discussion agreements interest rates a bit negotiable the philippine government was able to push that to push that down to some degree uh when it comes to um the exclusion of the paris cross the san diego um you know the chinese laws cannot be part of that because they really want to deal with stuff on their own uh labor is a bit more negotiable it depends on the project and other things so a lot of these things are some of them are negotiable some of them are not negotiable but when it comes to other things like who gets to benefit from the project how class can the project be implemented um are there in social environmental safeguards those are up to the host countries and the chinese government environment in my view would actually agree to that and for me that is the model dr gamma when you're talking about you you talked about the balance between lenders and borrowers for the paris club and where the chinese model doesn't really incorporate that but then uh like you point out in your writings say president duterte would be it's in his motivation uh to rationally get projects that can be uh finished during his term or at least give him political benefit right which means that and the corollary which you pointed out uh the chinese only are dealing with the ruling elites not opposition or other community leaders means if there's a change in power then there's a problem for sure so there could be a problem for sure um so with the first so with the first um yeah so with your first comment um it i i feel it it is quite short-sighted for the chinese uh for the chinese lenders to sort of focus on this to sort of agree to any political elite and power it's a bit short-sighted because if there's going to be a backlash then the backlash would not just be limited to the turkey it would also sort of refract or cascade into the chinese vendors but um this is not to say that they don't make any relationships with any of any uh apartment they definitely have relationships with other elites in the philippines not just the territory many other elites but the important caveat of that is that the elites that they have a relationship with they have to be at least in a correlation with the dirty government so for instance they have a relationship with hong kong marcos who's the son of the former dictator and they have really initiated the former president now at the moment those three actors are sort of like in a coalition in the philippine government that they work together and of course the chinese government discriminated with everybody but like with these three acres but the moment that these three actors sort of pursued their own path in terms of electoral gain then the chinese government would end up you know they would end up having to choose which person to like ally with and in the end they're going to allie with the person who's going to win the elections because that's that's the way their model works and if um the person who wins does not want to work with them or finds their previous feelings to be a problem then let's go that's going to create backlash on the chinese government and you've done a lot of work on this it's not just your latest even going back to your dissertation or probably before that where you argue that the chinese are looking for locally strong leaders who are friendly to them right uh yeah so this is an argument there is an argument that i make in um in my dissertation this is based on the premise that uh this well this is based on the two things number one um within china the way they reward provincial elites the central government and provincial government the way they award prevention release would be professional elites who can keep the provinces stable to allow the business environment to continue so that you don't have radical demands from let's say protesters or social movements or local elites who can crush these movements when they make radical demands the second thing is that um when china was you know moving out of like you know investing out in the late 90s they were not sure about what's happening in the local environments of other countries but the only thing they're sure about is if they're friends with another person in power then this person in power can ensure the viability and the profitability of their investment ventures so this is why in my view they invested we tried to invest in strong leaders they believed she was a strong leader until they were proven otherwise if the person is not strong then it creates backlash on the chinese government however the person is actually strong and they got it right he creates backlash as well because this leader can use the leverage to push back against china and pursue other goals so the territory for me is protecting on and gambling that's a form of backlash so this backlash that you are talking about uh how prevalent is it in current uh circumstances in the philippines uh so not just in the philippines in my view so for me this backlash uh so this backlash is uh number one it happens on other policy fronts not necessarily the you know the main relationship between the uh let's see the chinese government and the philippines or another host country so for instance um between 2016 and 2020 rodrigo de turret they protected on in gambling despite this insistence of the chinese government to sort of shut down their sports firms in 2019 being called duterte and who sent the shuttle online did not do it now um until now online gambling was increasing in the philippines until recently because of the pandemic when the pandemic sort of like sort of limited on and gambling improves duterte uh pushed back on the chinese government through some other ways so the wits on the with some grief issue for me is tied to that that you know he can't push back on gambling anymore because he was using that for that seeking opportunities he's gonna push back on other ways in other things so he can maintain his domestic political uh you know legitimacy if he doesn't push back on that that's what's bad now this happens in other countries as well so a good example would be chocolate perceived to be strong in my dissertation and for me in the recent in the past years he's actually a strong leader he has consolidated his power to be a strong leader and he's pushing back on china and the naduna islands and the chinese government cannot do anything about it because you know their entire venture in the military lies on japanese elites so this is for me uh a case of pushback this this often happens because the chinese government invests in a leader who is strong and perceived to be strong and it's actually strong very interesting that you are linking wits and rifa one motherly online gambling in the philippines just my last question on how duterte is really looking at the whole geopolitical issue you know when your philippines is a u.s treaty ally defense partner yet he has been seen to be tilting towards china but the latest uh couple of months this year have been also about uh whitson reef so are there separate silos he deals with the chinese or how does it work um so yeah it's really hard to make any assessment based on that whether they're the class because because it keeps changing uh you know i mean with china friendly with china in the recent years it's been like oh we're actually gonna like push back and then just i think yesterday he was like oh we're gonna we're gonna scrap the forces agreement but we'll do it next in the next six months we're not gonna do it immediately for me the most important thing about the third day it's not it's not to think of him as a puppet of china or some sort of like you know some sort of like you know personal destiny agency we have to think of the data as a politician and you know going back to what any politician wants is political survival it's about maximizing its political power domestically and and all of these decisions for me give him the flexibility to sort of adapt his position to any domestic situation that occurs so to me that's what's happening when it comes to the south china sea you know geo you know geopolitics uh u.s philippines you know all of these other things a lot of these things are flexible for me it's all about women for me the uterus view is all about political survival and maximizing political power dr gamma absolutely appreciate your time and your expertise

WQgUiHjIeOw,"U.S. and China increase military deployments in South China Sea, as tensions rise","With President Trump''s tough stance on the legality of China''s claims to the South China Sea, military tensions between the two superpowers are brewing. On Friday, satellite imagery revealed an unprecedented eight Chinese PLA air-to-air and air-to-ship fighter jets on one of the Paracel Islands. The U.S. military has also confirmed that two long-range supersonic B-1B Lancers took off from the U.S. mainland for repositioning in Guam. The U.S. claims to be protecting its allies in the region, but its message for China is clear.

Two days ago, two U.S. carrier groups performed an exercise in the South China Sea, while on Friday satellite imagery revealed a bird''s eye view of Chinese air force deployments on Woody Island.  

On the island''s airstrip, eight Chinese jets could be seen lined up in a row. Foreign media have continually reposted the photographs, commenting that this was the first time for such a large contingent to be seen on the island. 

Smith Chen
Defense analyst
It''s true that the configuration of this deployment is totally different from what we have seen in the past. Fighter jets are deployed to maintain air superiority. Attack aircraft or bombers are used for anti-ship attacks and bombing missions. The Chinese navy and air force must be considering whether permanently stationing these aircraft on the island are worth the logistics costs. If not, they will likely use troop rotations to establish its presence on the island installation

Experts still do not rule out that China may make these kinds of deployments part of its regular operations in the region.  Its goal is nothing less than that of challenging the U.S. and gaining sovereignty over the sea. 

Websites devoted to exposing flight movements were replete with images on July 18 of two B-1B Lancers, long-range multi-mission supersonic conventional bombers, taking off  from a base in South Dakota, crossing the Pacific Ocean and landing in Guam for stationing, bringing the number of B-1Bs in Guam''s Anderson Air Force Base to four. The Indo-Pacific Command confirmed that this deployment was aimed at fulfilling U.S. defense commitments to its allies. These remarks were clearly aimed at China. 

Smith Chen
Defense analyst
China often says that they have their so-called Xian H-6 Strategic Bomber that, when coupled with CJ-10 cruise missiles, can threaten Guam.

WY4ExNBxKmI,A Rocket Deal That Will Make Waves in the South China Sea to fend off China,"A Rocket Deal That Will Make Waves in the South China Sea to fend off China - The waters of the South China Sea could soon be heating up once more. This week, the South China Morning Post reported that the United States and the Philippines discussed the placement of an upgraded High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in the contested body of water to defend against China's militarization of its artificial islands in the area. The report, however, said Washington and Manila failed to reach a deal because the Philippines cannot afford the ""expensive"" HIMARS.
The report comes amid continuing uncertainty about the countries' alliance under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's administration, as well as questions over whether Manila wishes to review the nations' 70-year-old Mutual Defense Treaty. Recently, the pair's defense chiefs reaffirmed their ""enduring alliance"" and agreed to increase the interoperability of their forces; at the same time, the United States also pledged to continue its support for the Philippine armed forces.
Earlier this week, the two countries also kicked off the Balikatan military exercises, which have featured new U.S. fighter jets, as well as greater participation from the Australian military and observers from Southeast Asia.
The discussion in question appears to have been limited to a U.S. push for the Philippines to purchase HIMARS units, yet it also opens the door to a possible break with U.S. policy. After all, any potential U.S. military deployment in the South China Sea — whether with HIMARS or something else — would go beyond the freedom of navigation operations the United States currently conducts in the area. By increasing its military presence, the United States would bolster the Philippines' maritime claims and perhaps deter China from making more inroads in the South China Sea — something that Washington's present operations in the waters are failing to do.
Any HIMARS deployment in the South China Sea would put China's artificial islands in the Spratly chain within striking distance. Given that such weapons could upend the balance on the waters, the Philippines (and other neighbors the United States could approach for a possible sale) are likely to consider the deployment of HIMARS units very carefully. Manila has balked at the price of the system, but such is Washington's desire to roll back Beijing that it could offer a discount to ease the Philippines' financial concerns. If Duterte's government ultimately agrees to deploy HIMARS units, it would also represent a major change in its own relationship with China, as Manila has recently been pursuing detente with Beijing and a soft response to China's militarization and greater assertivenessin the South China Sea.
The installation of HIMARS units or other U.S. weapons in the Spratlys could spark China to further weaponize its artificial islands and respond by harassing Philippine forces in the islands, especially their logistics and resupply operations. And if China believes the United States itself is preparing to deploy forces there, it could try to prevent Manila from preparing for their arrival by disrupting their construction operations. Doing so, however, could ratchet up tensions in the area, complicating Beijing's efforts to cultivate allies along its periphery to deflect U.S. pressure amid the two giants' great power competition.
China has been steadily increasing its military presence in the South China Sea in recent years. In 2012, China seized the Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines; it has also built seven artificial islands in the Spratly chain since 2013 and worked to prevent Vietnam and the Philippines from exploring for energy in areas it deems disputed. According to reports, China has installed anti-ship and surface-to-air missile systems on three artificial islands, including the Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs, and repeatedly rejected U.S. demands to remove the systems. With the United States pushing the Philippines to purchase a new rocket-launching system, a showdown in the shoals may be on the way.

XzIfsY2tZc4,China angry U.S. warship entering South China Sea,"中, 美 남중국해 '항해의 자유' 작전에 ""즉시 중단하라"" 반발
China is up in arms after a U.S. Navy warship sailed near an artificial island built by China in the South China Sea.
The operation near Mischief Reef on Thursday was the first ""freedom of navigation"" exercise under the Trump administration.
With more on this and other news around the world we turn to Ro Aram..
Aram... nearly all territories in the South China Sea are claimed by China, including reefs and islands also claimed by other nations.
Beijing is unhappy about the presence of U.S. vessels in the area, but Washington insists its navy can sail in any international waters....

Well Jihye...China's foreign ministry condemned the USS Dewey for entering its waters without permission, but as you said the U.S. insists it's free to send ships along critical sea lines near the region as it does not see these artificial islands warranting territorial sovereignty.
The U.S. Navy has previously sent ships and planes near the disputed territory to signal to China that it intends to keep critical sea lanes open.
However, Beijing's foreign ministry said the vessel was trespassing and has been warned to leave, adding it was undermining China's sovereignty and security interests.

AP 4098179 / 1 
""The Chinese Navy identified the relevant U.S. navy vessel in accordance with the law and warned it to leave. The relevant actions taken by the U.S. vessel undermine China's sovereignty and security interests and are very likely to cause an expected sea and air accident. We are strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to that.""

The spokesman also said the U.S. move has disrupted positive efforts by China and ASEAN members in trying to resolve the situation in the South China Sea.

AP 4098179 / 1 
""With the concerted efforts made by regional countries, like China and the ASEAN countries, the situation in the South China Sea is cooling down and showing positive signs of development. However, what the US has done causes severe disruptions of the process of dialogue and consultation. It will bring itself no good while hurting others.""

The latest USS Dewey operation is likely to weigh on U.S.-China relations as Washington attempts to draw support from Beijing on reining in North Korea.

yqrNBDDq-dA,Power projection and deterrence - Krista Wiegand,"Power Projection and Deterrence: South China Sea Disputants as Pawns in the U.S.-China Rivalry

In the past decade, China has pursued consistent low-level provocations against disputants to seize or prevent other states’ access to islands, maritime features, and waters in the South China Sea. China could significantly benefit from access to oil, natural gas, seabed resources, and maritime trade lanes by controlling these features.

Wiegand argues that, despite China’s claims about sovereignty and maritime rights, strategic interests dominate China’s goals in the South China Sea. She argues that China is using the South China Sea disputes as part of a deliberate strategy for power projection, through intimidation of disputant states, and deterrence of the U.S. By establishing strategic depth through seizure and militarisation of artificial islands in the South China Sea, China is able both to project its own military capabilities and to increase costs that will ideally prevent any potential U.S. threats to the Chinese mainland.

China’s territorial and maritime claims strategies are therefore mainly a means for China to establish a security barrier to deter potential U.S. actions against China. Although China’s goals reflect its interests in extending territorial sovereignty and other tangible gains, its overarching, long term goals are power projection and deterrence. Krista Wiegand is Director of the Global Security Program and Faculty Fellow at the Howard H. Baker, Jr. Center for Public Policy and Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

go and i'm the sheridan professor of strategic policy studies at the australian national university from where i'm convening this webinar i would like to begin with an important convention we observe in australia by acknowledging and celebrating the first australians on whose lands we meet the anu is located in the australian capital territory and the traditional custodians of our land are the nanual people we pay our respects to the elders past present and emerging welcome to this third event in our women in asia pacific security research seminar series to our live audience it's really lovely to see you here with us today thank you all for making time to join us and to those of you who will be tuning in a little bit later to view our recording greetings and we hope we'll be able to engage with you live in one of our later seminars in the series when the time zones line up our aim in this series is to showcase the cutting edge academic research of women in the fields of asia pacific security broadly defined and this series is targeted at international scholarly communities working on this important region today the series comprises interactive round tables as well as virtual research seminars like today as well as events that discuss recently published books if you look in the chat function for the live audience you'll see that we've put up two links uh the first link is will take you to the 2021 schedule for this seminar series which also contains the links to the recordings of our two 2020 events the second link will take you to today's seminar page which also includes a short reading list of other women scholars working in the topic that we're going to address today publications from other women scholars so um right now it's my very great pleasure to introduce briefly our speaker for today dr christa vegan who has very kindly agreed to deliver this research seminar krista is director of the global security program and faculty fellow at the baker center for public policy and associate professor in the department of political science at the university of tennessee in knoxville where she's now joining us from dr vegan received her phd in political science from duke university and she is an international relations scholar specializing in international conflict management and political violence she is the author of multiple books um and has co-edited a book as well on these subjects i'll leave you to look in more detail at her cv for follow-up on these publications christa is also the co-editor-in-chief of the journal international security international studies quarterly which is the flagship journal of the international studies association she's going to speak to us today about a draft paper entitled power projection and deterrence south china sea disputes as pawns sorry south china sea disputants as pawns in the u.s china rivalry um we're going to do this session the following way with christ's agreement she's going to speak for about 40 to 45 minutes to set out her analysis and argument in what is a very detailed paper and then we'll spend the rest of the time that we've got in uh discussion and q a session and for the q a i invite all participants to try and pose questions using the chat function and what i'll do is to use mixed methods to ensure that we can address as many discussion points as possible once christus finished her presentation so now to assist with the stability of the internet connection could i ask members of the audience kindly to perhaps turn off your videos as i hand over to krista for her presentation and then we'll turn them back on again for the discussion segment um krista um if you're ready very happy to hand over to you at this point thank you well thank you so much evelyn for the invitation and thank you all this evening or this afternoon or tomorrow in the morning wherever you are in the world uh for attending the talk so thank you again uh let me just uh share my screen with you okay hopefully everybody can see my screen now so uh just to give you a little background uh as evelyn mentioned my area of specialty is international conflict and security specifically territorial and maritime disputes so this is the area in which i'm approaching this paper is not as a china specialist or not necessarily as a as a typical power politics person but looking at this from the context of territorial and maritime disputes so my previous research my first book and our second book and uh several of my journal articles that i've worked on all frame territorial and maritime disputes in the context of the use or even i would some in some cases say manipulation by governments and how these governments use these disputes for bargaining leverage or for strategic reasons and in some cases even for nationals domestic nationalist purposes to to mobilize uh populations now not all territorial and maritime disputes are pursued for those reasons but there are a good number of cases in the world where we see patterns of governments using disputes and kind of taking advantage of them or in some cases even starting them or provoking them for the purpose for their own strategic purposes so that's the context of uh of this paper with a slightly different twist of course okay so the research questions most studies that look at the south china sea and there are many many many studies there are many books there are many articles which is great it's a very hot topic for policy reasons for academic reasons and so forth and most of those studies look at specific aspects of the dispute the legal international law aspect they look at it from uh from a naval perspective in terms of freedom of navigation and and naval capabilities and air capabilities they look at it from a sovereignty international law territorial sovereignty and maritime rights perspective so regarding unclose and all the the maritime entitlements that the features of the rocks reef shoals and banks and islands provide uh as well as of course all the provocations uh and uh low-level tactics these gray zone tactics that china has pursued over the last decade or so so there's been a lot of research about about the south china sea so i am building on some of this but i wanted to kind of step back and ask a more broader question and that is you know a lot of people talk about the south china sea as a flashpoint or a a cause of maybe it will provoke war between the us and china in particular the us and allies i should say and china and i'm thinking i actually wonder if it's the reverse that this dispute is actually being used primarily by china as a means as or as is part of a greater strategic rivalry with the us and so therefore it's not necessarily a uh a cause but actually a consequence i'm also wondering of course what are china's ultimate goals here i mean there are again lots of explanations lots of theories about what china's doing uh lots of china specialists have made excellent arguments chinese scholars themselves uh and so forth china watchers uh so why is china pursuing these low-level provocations why did they in the past few years since uh you know 2012 2013 why did they start seizing features maritime features and militarizing them and building them up and of course they're continuing to harass uh disputants in the south china sea so those are the main questions that i'm asking here my theory is as i mentioned at the beginning more broadly that china is using these territorial and maritime claims as part of its greater strategic rivalry with uh the us and what i propose here is a theory again it's just it's just a new a new term uh called projected to determine so it's a combination of power projection and deterrence uh and so it combines compellence it combines deterrence traditional compellence traditional deterrence and power product uh power projection so that's the causal story that i'll be talking about and what i'm arguing is that the end goals for china are to increase costs for the u.s for deterrence purposes so that they don't there's no threat to the china to the chinese mainland by by establishing a security barrier in the south china sea and uh and also simultaneously expanding chinese power projection further into the pacific so that's essentially establishing strategic depth so china is essentially using this dispute these claims to build up their military capabilities with strategic depths and more effectively deter the us so this is just one of the strategies it's using in one of the regions it's areas it's using we could talk much more about all the other regions of the world where china is reaching out uh with the belt road initiative and all these other investments in africa and so forth so this is just one piece of that uh broader broader uh strategy so this dispute i would argue can be understood in the context of power politics rather than just a traditional territorial maritime dispute so the theory that i'll talk about has essentially three stages uh direct deterrence so we're talking about a a typical state in this case a rising power china trying to deter an attack on its on that state from uh a potential attacker so for the from this is all from the perspective of china i should say the us probably has the same i know that the us has the same uh perspective that it's trying to deter china uh but in this case china is deterring the u.s so the u.s here is considered the potential attacker the second part here is the idea that china is compelling or using coercion and this is the harassment this is the seizing of maritime features and so forth against the disputants in the south china sea primarily vietnam and the philippines a little bit malaysia but those are the two main uh target states and these are states that essentially control what i would call offshore territories and these territories are not actually territories as we know they're maritime features that have become uh artificial islands but nevertheless they are important to china's strategy and then the third stage is a subsequent stage that is only possible through a combination of direct deterrence and compellence of these disputants and that is this idea of projected deterrence uh by by china as the rising power of the status quo state simultaneously projecting its power now i'll talk a little later about whether this is uh a balance of power concept or power transition concept i actually think it's a little bit of both and a little bit of neither so that's i'll get to that a little later okay so i'll start off with direct deterrence you're all familiar i'm sure with the concept of deterrence uh you know in this case direct occurrence uh refers specifically to the state that is uh trying to avoid being attacked or not talking about uh extended deterrence like with an ally uh so in the case you know extended deterrence would be the us deterring china from attacking taiwan for example or the u.s deterring north korea from attacking south korea so that's that's extended to terms this is just very simply direct deterrence will the u.s attack china and if so if there's any chance china needs to actively deter the us directly and the way they do that the way that a defender state the state that could be attacked would would deter is through increasing costs and that way by increasing costs uh the defender state is less i'm sorry the potential attacker is less likely to it becomes too costly to or or high that costs are so high the potential attacker reconsiders the attack and does not pursue the attack so we know that uh china has had exponential growth uh of their military spending in the past two decades there is so much evidence of this uh china watchers military watchers are uh very aware of this according to a 2020 department of defense u.s department of defense report to congress over the past two decades uh china strengthened and modernized its um army and navy in nearly every aspect um it's built the largest navy in the world and there are recent reports lately of uh up to 2040 2035 2040 uh where at some point in that in the time period between now and then china's navy capabilities will in fact tilt the balance uh against the us and they will have stronger uh naval capability so that is a concern um and clearly evidence that there is uh china is creating building this huge navy for to to deter somebody and we we assume it's the us and uh u.s allies and then the u.s led uh system so such military growth is substantial uh it's abs i'm sorry substantive and it's very challenging to the u.s and it is uh clearly in my view a form of uh direct deterrence but uh deterrence from the mainland is less effective than if it's coupled with what we would call offshore deterrence capabilities so in the the case of the us uh the us has bases all over the world we have uh there is there is um the the ability to to to increase costs and deter uh is is spread broadly across the world and in from a naval perspective uh we have uh many bases of course in uh in asia itself and of course in guam and hawaii uh and in the in the middle pacific so the us is very capable of uh of of having these offshore capabilities china on the other hand um is new to this game and i'll talk about that uh in a little bit so compellence again this is you know a simple security concept about uh how one state tries to force or coerce another state usually a weaker state to change a policy or stop doing something in this case i'm talking about the disputants in the in the south china sea so these are states that maintain have maintained control uh of certain maritime features and uh china has essentially seized these uh these maritime features or uh it also can involve uh the the harassment that we that we've seen uh not just against the us but also directly against uh the disputing states themselves so we know vietnam malaysia last year there were some quite a few harassment uh well there are always lots of harassment tactics but some of the bigger ones uh more recently were were against uh vietnam and malaysia last year so uh what compellence does is it signals resolve to those states of course uh and it compels the defender states the disputants in this case to uh consider their demands they don't have a choice they're weaker states these are states that do not have capable military capabilities to stand up to china china knows this china takes advantage of them done so mr reef was taken in 1995 other reefs other maritime features were taken from vietnam uh most recently in 2012 scarborough shoal was taken from the philippines directly in the uh philippine exclusive economic zone uh right off the coast of the philippines so that is pretty bold uh uh exam those are that's a pretty bold example of compellence so the this is the uh this is the part where china is then is is using they're deterring the us and directly but there's also this strategy of of compelling these other states to change their strata change their policy and essentially turn over these maritime features without choice essentially so the next part is uh this theory of the revised theory of the new theory of projected deterrence is combination so after decades of focusing on the continent primarily deterring the soviet union and then of course on the coast uh focusing very narrowly on taiwan and for good reason of course um you know over the last couple decades there's been a broader shift to the broader the wider pacific so china has uh we all know has has been shifting its focus much more beyond uh trying to reacquire taiwan uh taiwan from a sovereignty perspective so where is this coming from well china is clearly challenging u.s military dominance in the indo-pacific region mainly in southeast asia specifically in the south china sea and as i mentioned before unlike the us china does not have foreign bases they are starting to now they're built trying to build one in in cambodia they're trying to they're building navy bases in uh in africa on the african coast and in other parts of the uh the world uh but very different than the us so china is is starting at a much uh reduced capacity uh in terms of offshore basing for projection and deterrence reasons uh they also don't have allies where they can put bases uh the way that the u.s does um so china is is starting in this position and it really needs to catch up quickly so the south china sea is a great starting point to dive into like literally uh in a really strong way just just to go full force ahead and with both power projection and deterrence so how uh where does this where does the south china sea fit well militarization of the of these maritime features that were seized as well as increased uh control of the water so china policing and uh and spending time a lot having ships in the region in the sea trying to harass others that are and trying to stop freedom of navigation and and harassing both u.s and allied vessels as well as the disputing vessels directly has allowed china to do two things it's allowed uh it's allowed it's uh an extension of its military capabilities for power projection reasons and then it is allowing a deterrence further deterrence from away from the mainland and to deny uh not just not just to to deter a potential attack on on china but more broadly to deny us military actions in the region more broadly so this is essentially a some people call it deterrence by denial uh effort to deny the us the ability to maintain its status as the dominant military uh power in the region in the indo-pacific so these chinese land grabs then and all these maritime clashes in the south china sea have allowed china to create these offshore bases which provide as i mentioned earlier strategic depth to expand into the pacific and challenge us dominance in the region and then also create this security barrier which raises the costs of any potential u.s attack on the chinese man land mainland as well as denying access uh to parts of the region uh for for the us as well as its allies but the focus of course is on the u.s now i should mention that uh this is not unique to the south china sea uh the east china sea is also a potential access point uh to the broader pacific for china and china also as as uh you may know has a claim a territorial maritime claim on the senkaku slash daiyu islands depending on if you're japanese or chinese uh japan maintains uh control of of those islands it's not they're not again not even really islands uh some of them are but they're not they're not all islands uh china also has very similar claims uh the the claims are not quite as extensive in terms of like the nine-dash line that china has in the south china sea the difference in my perspective between the east china sea and the south china sea is that the disputant is japan and japan is not the philippines japan is not malaysia or vietnam those states are much weaker the us even though it's allied with the philippines that alliance as you may know is is much weaker there are no bases since the early 1990s in the philippines so the the the u.s alliance system in this in the southern parts in southeast asia is much weaker than in northeast asia so we have korea we have japan we have tens of thousands of american troops and airmen and naval vessels and navy stationed in uh right in eastern uh northeast asia including the ryoko island chain not very far from um these disputed waters in the east china sea so that is a little more difficult for china to confront in terms of uh power projection and deterrence uh to use that dispute for the same strategic purposes i think it is still very strategic why they're claiming that he's trying to see to for it is for this for similar reasons but it is much it is a much more difficult uh pursuit than it would be than it uh than it has been i should say for in in the south china sea so i want to talk now about some competing explanations and i don't think that these are i should maybe i shouldn't use the term competing because i don't think these are necessarily competing but i think that they are alternative explanations that we could consider as china's primary goals for its south china sea claims and actions the first one is that china just truly believes that these are legal they have legal rights and legal sovereignty claims to the islands and maritime features and waters in the in the south china sea so this is the 9-line claim based on a 1947 uh claim that taiwan made and based on a historic map and uh that was was reinstated in 2009 by the chinese um in the novel to the united nations so this is a a fairly vague uh sovereignty claim uh china essentially claims the the south china sea as internal waters so nothing that actually that concept does not exist in the u.n convention of the law of sea uh so for the lobster it's not a there's no such thing except in a bay uh obviously the south china sea is not a bay uh so china has essentially made up its own uh legal definition of internal waters uh and and there's no question i think that you know from a legal perspective china is pushing uh this claim from a legal perspective um but uh there are some questions about whether this is is really the main goal and i'll talk about that in a minute the other alternative explanation is the economic benefits there's lots of evidence of oil and natural gas i should say there there's it is expected to be there's evidence of of uh exploration of an assumption of oil natural gas seabed particularly seabed minerals the seabed in the continental shelf those are where things are happening right now uh in terms of maritime exploration resource exploitation so there is a potential that china is pursuing this uh these claims and actions for uh for those reasons so from from the perspective of the legal sovereignty claims as i mentioned these are fairly vague claims uh and and if you look at the legal claims that china has made over the last 11 or 12 years they've been fairly inconsistent not only from a international perspective but actually domestically as well so people who do research within china or have interviewed people off the record in the government and the military and so forth have heard conflicting statements conflicting claims they're conflicting reasons given why china is doing what it's doing in the south china sea so there's a little bit of ambivalence or a lot i should say a lot and it is uh many people say it's and i believe this that it's actually very deliberate to have an ambiguous claim so that china doesn't get backed into a corner from a legal perspective but that also tells me that that suggests that china doesn't really want to resolve this dispute and the reason i say that is there are two reasons the first uh is china does have a history of resolving its disputes peacefully bilaterally in most cases um yeah but there is no way china is going to resolve this dispute there is no indication whatsoever uh and by far the the clearest uh signal of that is the 2013 to 2016 arbitration case that the philippines brought uh through an annex uh seven tribunal against china in which china refused to participate refused to acknowledge uh the uh the tribunal uh was even going on and then of course refused to has refused to comply with the rulings which 90 of which ruled against china there are there actually is evidence that if china were to seek legal uh dispute resolution china would actually have a case for some of the maritime features for some of the waters based on historic precedent historic treaties and historic maps and so forth so if china really wanted this for legal sovereign reasons they could actually pursue they could go to the international court of justice in particular or to the international tribune of the law of the sea or even an annex seven uh arbitration tribunal and they could say look we have proof now but that's not really what's happening um part of that is because china does not want to participate in those multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms and doesn't really respect that uh western if you will uh form of dispute mechanisms china however is a signatory a and uh ratified uh unclose uh so it is not it is supposed to be following on close uh but it is not i should mention also uh just for the record the united states is not a member of uncles either even though uh the lawyers who created uncles were primarily american so you may know that uh the us congress is uh has never been willing to ratify for a variety of reasons that we don't have time to get into uh but but nevertheless the u.s even though the u.s is not ratified on close the uh us government's position is that it pursues and follows and complies with enclosed rules and the articles in unclass so it still is uh complying with them close so that's that's the argument there uh so there seem to be several indicators here that china's end goal is not to just acquire these for sovereignty reasons to say these are chinese seems like there's something more strategic going on now from an economic perspective uh there are lots of potential uh significant resources as i mentioned up to 11 billion barrels of oil 190 tons of cubic feet of uh natural gas we have 12 of the international fish catch which is huge in fact fishing may be considered more important than oil and natural gas especially in the next few decades if energy is shifting to more natural resources or non-uh gas and oil resources sufficient fishing is is very important and that's where a lot of these clashes have occurred between china and vietnam malaysia philippines primarily is overfishing access however china has not really sought out these resources either so there has been there have been a few cases where china has sent exploration vessels uh to seek or to explore for resources but they're not really they don't seem very s uh uh valid like they don't seem to be very valid uh re uh that's not their valid purpose and in many cases it seems like it's really just harassment more than anything so there really has been um very limited exploration and attempts at our full acquisition and and more importantly there is not as i just said there has been no attempt to resolve the dispute to achieve secure access to these resources and the reason that's important is that even though china has its own oil companies uh to do the exploration uh it is very difficult especially for other oil companies they are very unwilling or they are willing to buy oil from a disputed territory or gas so there the east china sea for example there has been it's been very difficult or often you may have heard of the case a dispute between uh turkey and greece and the aegean sea over oil and natural gas resources so there's oil companies are very hesitant to get involved in any dispute unless it's resolved in any waters i should say until they're resolved the maritime boundaries are resolved and that is not going to happen in in this case um and more finally there's been no attempt at joint development unlike the east china sea where japan and china actually do have an agreement beyond the areas where the dispute actually the overlap part occurs on the outer bands of that overlap there has been some agreement for joint development of resources in in that in the east china sea that has not been the case at all there have been talk there's been some talk of joint development uh some states are balking at uh joint development with with china but china has not pushed uh that agenda very much so to me that signals this is not really the main purpose for china's activities in the south china sea so i'm going to turn now to what i would call what i what i think is is a good amount of evidence that's that suggests that china does in fact need or has a justification for deterring the us and then also power projection as well so to start off with um the chinese defense position statements talk about the south china sea in the context of a us-china rivalry so to me that's a clear i mean that's as direct as you can get um in terms of the the role of the south china sea in that context so that's from the chinese perspective um if we go back to the 2011 asia pivot of the obama administration in the u.s uh this is when we really see uh the strategic rivalry that we see now taking off even though the obama administration was not as hostile as the trump administration against china uh the pivot was interpreted by china they were a little surprised or even in some cases people say they were shocked by the pivot and the and the focus and it was believed that uh that it was in fact pursued the pivot was pursued as a direct challenge to china's growing role in the region uh and so we've seen an expansion of chinese military capabilities since then of course uh from a military perspective the 2010 youth uh us air sea battle military strategy has a new name since 2015 and it's a longer name um this is a pentagon uh offensive plans to take out chinese missile sites infrastructure communications all sorts of things in mainland china so this exists this is a you know this is a document this is a plan uh it's probably not it wouldn't it hasn't been pursued obviously and it probably won't be some many military analysts in the usa it's not necessary but the plan exists and the fact that it exists and that there is a offensive plan to take out of course they would call it deterrence you know defensive but it essentially it is offensive to take out um or attack the mainland of china this is uh this would be cons i think this is would be alarming to china and justify uh increased military capabilities uh to deter the us now since the uh seizure the seizures of these maritime features um were in the earlier 2010s but since then um during the sa the the stage of building up these islands and militarizing them uh a number of u.s uh uh military strategy came out the department of defense asia pacific maritime strategy the u.s i'm sorry the chinese interpretation of this was uh that uh the us was planning was essentially containing china uh as part of the u.s uh great power u.s china great power competition uh the 2017 national security strategy of the trump administration uh talked about forward military presidents in the pacific and south pacific uh southeast asian uh pacific region uh to deter and deny uh and if necessary defeat china so that's again right there we have chinese justification for deterrence uh and then uh most recently uh a declassified 2018 white house document uh lists um maintaining u.s primacy in the indo-pacific and preventing china from establishing what it's referred to as an illiberal sphere of influence as primary strategic goals so here we have direct evidence of uh of a need to deter um from uh for china to deter the us not just from a direct deterrence perspective but more broadly and i'll talk about that now so why what does this have to do with the south china sea well here we have this is where the south china sea comes in in terms of creating a security barrier and this is done through anti-access area denial so this kind of deterrence by denial strategy of having these capabilities militarizing these artificial islands providing offshore basing providing forward deployment so we have surface-to-air missiles we have anti-ship cruise missiles we have air and maritime defense systems fighter aircraft that have um that have radar and so forth and uh and final aircraft and long runways um so what does this do well this uh projects power which i'll talk about in a minute but from a deterrence perspective it pushes out the uh this this uh these capabilities to deter the us more directly in the region uh more closely out in the in into the pacific a little bit uh and so essentially what this is doing is it's impeding freedom of navigation it's limiting u.s air power capabilities in addition to all of the harassment that uh china is doing to the disputants themselves so essentially this this uh anti-excess area denial by china is providing effective deterrence or fairly effective deterrence uh of us military act activities in the region overall so it's not just deterring an attack on china but it is pushing out uh the the it's causing problems for uh the the the u.s goal of maintaining uh dominance uh military dominance in the region in the long term now from a power projection standpoint um the long-time maritime strategy of china well uh we know that china wants to counter us this u.s strategic advantage in the region and specifically challenge the us-led rules-based order and this of course includes own clothes and freedom of navigation and so forth that i've talked about before uh of course there's been a significant increase in naval capabilities and there will be uh to move toward a strong blue water navy uh 2040 is you know is this kind of date of when things will really be you know this super strong navy in particular um but from a power projection standpoint it's not just uh signaling resolve and showing that uh china's capable what it's in my view it's very much combined with a deterrent strategy and this is why it's hard for me to pull these apart i don't think we can say they're just deterring they're just projecting power it really is a combined uh strategy so from a from a projection standpoint uh and deterrent standpoint um china is now able to move beyond this first island chain to the second island chain providing further access to u.s naval vessels further out in the pacific as well as u.s bases airfields u.s territory with long-range missiles and this access to the second island chain and and beyond um has increased china's naval reach um and it's really going to tilt the balance of power and i've seen reports i mean there's lots of reports by think tanks in the us and in australia and other china watchers saying you know when is this going to happen it is it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and this is uh i some people are more alarmed than others but there's definitely a uh a cautious uh watching of this happening so the south china sea in my view provides this expanded maritime domain sea control broadened access to the pacific now it's not ideal it's not that they're going really far into the pacific because the philippine island chain the archipelago still is fairly limiting but overall it does provide a fairly effective means to challenge the us as the dominant actor in the region uh and the u.s alliance network in in the indo-pacific overall so to conclude um i looked at i questioned the primary objectives of the south china sea uh of china's actions in the south china sea examining three explanation uh explanations and i i think that the primary purpose is quite strategic to deter us threats to china and also project chinese power and as a result i think this con you know when we're talking about this conflict and this dispute unfortunately the disputants themselves are kind of uh really pawns in this game of great power politics and this is not really about the philippines um i actually did spend i spent a semester in manila interviewing military officials and government officials and uh you at both u.s uh and philippine officials about this the south china sea from the philippines perspective and i will never forget a uh in a confidential interview with a high-ranking u.s embassy staff person he told me we are only here because of the geostrategic location of the philippines that is why it's important and we need to deter china from that perspective and it was very blunt uh but i think that's that's one of the reasons why the south china sea is it is such a geostrategically important region now in terms of feedback i look forward to your comments and questions uh but i do want to leave you with a few points where i'm trying to decide if this is something these are kind of questions that i think would a reviewer say this in a journal review uh being a journal editor i'm always trying to think about what reviews would reviewers would say and i want to ask if anybody has any insight into whether it's necessary to distinguish between deterrence of the u.s attacking china the traditional definition of deterrence versus this broader deterrence of denial of of u.s military presence or actions in the broader indo-pacific um in of course in in this case in southeast asia but just the presence the military presence and military dominance um the second factor i'm not sure it matters or not does if it i'm trying to figure out if it matters that china is a rising power and that the us's status quo power is this important maybe it's not uh i also wonder uh i've had i had i gave presented this paper before about a month ago and somebody said this is a this is a question of balance of power or power transition theory you know and it's is china trying to transition it's you know uh through traditional power transition or is it trying to balance the u.s and i'm not really sure i really would rather stay away from that debate i think it's a mix of both uh but but i'd like to hear some feedback and then finally i uh it would be great to hear if you have any perspective on whether this theory is applicable to other cases or is this something unique to the south china sea with with it when when i did my research on the east china sea i was able to find uh cases all across the world of very similar patterns uh in guatemala and belize spain and gibraltar and the uk and morocco uh in the uk and northern morocco uh and china and russia the soviet union uh and a number of many other cases as well so uh that's something i haven't yet researched but i but i'm i'm hoping that would be the case so i'm going to stop there and i'll stop sharing my screen so thank you all very much i look forward to your comments and questions thanks very much krista that was uh that was great and thank you so much for um leaving plenty of time for a great discussion um in the remaining time that we've got um it's it's quite it's always really helpful when we've got a such a detailed but efficient um summary of of what is actually quite a long paper so thank you for doing that i think this place is actually everyone in the audience on the good footing to be able to engage uh with the substance of what's in in your paper regardless of whether they've actually read the paper itself um so thank you for that um i i'm going to as i explained earlier um uh invite uh participants to to uh leave us questions in the chat function if possible that's just easier for for me to see than if you do a raised hand function i'm also at this point going to invite participants if you like and you're comfortable with it to turn your videos back on so we have a bit more of a sense of being in a research seminar rather than a sort of you know distant activity um and if you like please you know turn on the the gallery function as well so we can see more of each other that's up to you um krista i'm going to uh in a way take the chair prerogative to to insert one uh response actually to your final uh uh request for feedback there um and it's to suggest that it seems to me that we when we think about this china case that you've put forward so eloquently one of the things that obviously needs to be considered from a strategic point of view is the old-fashioned geo in geopolitics you know geography of course matters enormously and what i felt might have benefited from a bit of airing in your paper is the fact that of course when we look at the east asian theater in which the south china sea sits you know the relative import of that strategic domain for china as opposed to for the united states is completely different um this is if we put it very bluntly this is china's backyard it's china's home ground as well so we think in terms of analogies you know it would be kind of like what how we would think about the us's power projection in the caribbean and you know the western pacific right probably stretching up to guam so how would we regard what's happening you know u.s bases and projections in that uh western hemisphere right that that for me would be the parallel for just in geographical terms for what china does or doesn't do in the south china sea and what it's trying to project in the south china sea now i think that's a small but quite important shift because i feel that instinctively for many people who discuss this issue about china's projection in the south china sea the thing that they're comparing it to is u.s projection in east asia right and that's just the wrong comparator if you take into account what i've just said about the relative import of the strategic domains being actually very different home ground non-home ground sphere of influence if you like to use the old uh phrase you know something that is much more than a spherical influence when it's projected halfway across the world so i i don't know exactly what terms you would like to use but i feel that that jill strategic element would actually explain quite a bit and shift um the focus quite a lot when we look at what china might conceivably be doing in terms of a2ad in this domain yeah um but i'll just leave it there with that very brief suggestion i'd like to um you know to kick this off um my colleague professor brendan taylor at the strategic and defense study center has very kindly agreed to to kick us off a bit more um into this discussion brendan's read your paper and and i believe has has a few um critical points to make to to help us get into this discussion brenda thank you so much for agreeing to do this well thank you thank you very much um evelyn i'm not sure how critical they'll be i thought it was an excellent uh paper and i'm conscious that we also have a very distinguished audience having a more distinguished audience and then useful so i'll try to keep these remarks um fairly fairly brief but one of the things i really i really liked about christa's paper is i don't think that we spend you know nearly enough time talking about the strategic and um i think just dovetails with the point you just made evil and i think that you know some of the defensive motivations that drive beijing's policies and behaviors towards the south china sea disputes and um you know i think the paper makes a very important contribution to that endeavor i'd like to make um three observations um about the paper um if i may and the first of those relates to the paper's focus on china's defensive motivations and i think that there are several areas where i think some further examples could usefully be added to to further strengthen the paper's overarching argument um i think some mention for example could be made of china's efforts to establish so-called bastions for its submarines and in the south china sea so what i'm talking about here crystal will be very aware of this already but for for others in the audience who may not be in those deep heavily defended waters where where china can hide it's um it's small and potentially vulnerable ssbn um force i think that would be helpful to add something on that in the paper i'd also like to see the paper draw out the south china sea's strategic importance to beijing in the context of the increasingly salient taiwan flashpoint and i think this could be done potentially from an historical perspective i think by pointing out that it was through establishing a foothold in the south china sea uh that appear imperial japan was able to capture portions of china as part of its ultimately unsuccessful attempt to become asia's dominant power during the 1930s and the 1940s i think defending against a modern day rerun of that potentiality a major power using the south china sea as a launching pad for operations during a taiwan contingency i think that remains an important preoccupation for beijing given that the paper focuses quite heavily on the importance of beijing's artificial features in the south china sea i think it would also benefit from some engagement with the ongoing debate regarding how strategically significant these features really are in practice now some analysts have argued that these features are tremendously important that they would allow beijing to control the waters in the airspace of the south china sea um even if this flash point where it were to erupt into conflict um but there are also many analysts who dispute this claim and they suggest that these outposts are next to impossible to defend and that they'd be very likely taken out in the early stages of any military conference confrontation i think it would be good if the paper could could perhaps acknowledge that debate and perhaps possibly even uh situate itself um within that debate the second point i'd like to make um and i think evil and this this reinforces the point that you're making in your opening uh remarks um i think it relates to christa's introduction of the the concept of projected deterrence and i think that this is potentially the most innovative and an exciting theoretical contribution of of the paper and as i was reading the paper however i couldn't help but wondering whether something new is is really happening here or whether what krista is really talking about is is the emerging or is the re-emergence of a of a much older concept the concept of um strategic perimeters strategic perimeters um as defined by our late colleague um coral bell are those geographic zones in which the strategic capabilities of other powers are a matter of watchful concern to armed forces and and their governments this was of course a concept that enjoyed its its heyday during the early decades of the cold war um it was dean atchison's failure in 1950 to include korea inside the publicly declared u.s strategic perimeter which was arguably a leading cause of the korean war and likewise it was moscow's placement of nuclear-capable missiles inside the u.s strategic perimeter that brought the world to the edge of the nuclear best during those fateful 13 days of october 1962. but a couple of more recent policy documents have led me to wonder whether the the concept of strategic perimeters might be making a comeback and the first of those was the recently declassified u.s strategic framework for the indo-pacific which talks about defending the first island chain nations including taiwan and dominating all domains outside the first island chain now does the first island chain today represent uh washington's current conception perhaps of a u.s strategic perimeter in asia the second policy document was australia's own 2020 defense strategic update which focuses our defence planning on australia's so-called immediate region defined as the area ranging from the northeast um north-eastern indian ocean through maritime and mainland south east asia to papua new guinea and the southwest pacific now i wonder is this perhaps australia's you know most recent enunciation of its own strategic perimeter and perhaps now as as i was reading through christ's paper i wondered whether beijing's behavior in the south china sea also reflects the prc establishing its own strategic perimeter rather than what christa calls projected deterrents so at the very least chris i'd be really interested in what you see as a relationship and the potential points of distinction between these two concepts finally i just i just had a very quick question about the the time frame um of the paper and particularly its focus um upon beijing's policies and behaviors over the past decade i think this question was largely inspired by the fact that i was also recently reading another excellent article on the south china sea um by my compatriot andrew chubb in the latest issue of international security i'm not sure whether you've had a chance to to read andrew's paper as yet christa but for the benefits once again of others in in the audience who haven't andrew's argument is that chinese provocations against disputants in the south china sea represent a much longer term project that stretches back at least half a century and he argues that while beijing's south china sea assertiveness has been steadily increasing during the period since there have been been at least four surges or what he calls surges in chinese assertiveness in 1973 in 1987 and 1992 and finally in 2007 and andrew argues that what we are seeing presently is merely a continuation of that last surge which transpired over a decade ago rather than something new or more recent now to be honest i'm still digesting that and i haven't made up my mind whether andrew is right or not he could well be wrong as fine as scholar as andrew is but um i'd really be interested in in your thoughts on um on andrew's argument because it's something that i'm on as you can tell still still grappling with chris i hope these thoughts on your your very very fine paper at least somewhat helpful um and many thanks again both to to yourself and to evelyn for the the opportunity to share these thoughts with this um distinguished audience today great thank you very much krista would you like to respond quickly to any of brendan's points sure just very briefly so we have uh some time uh thank you so much uh brendan these are great points and i think um it's interesting because you know i struggled with the the terminology and wondered is this really new but i i do think uh you know maybe may i like that term you know the the concept strategic perimeter uh but i i feel like to some degree i am making that argument maybe not in the the strongest sense that it's just because it's like as evelyn said earlier china's backyard um i you know i i i feel like uh yes absolutely the geostrategic location and the that you know china's wanting to i i have no doubt that china wants a strategic perimeter but i feel like it's beyond that i fee i feel like it you know at least china's long-term goal up to 2040 uh and it's everything it's doing with its multilateral institutions it's creation of these institutions it's you know investments internationally and so forth is really challenging the status quo dominance of the us from a from a power transition perspective so i think it's not it goes beyond uh just the the strategic perimeter in terms of military perimeter and i i understand the us you know certainly the western hemisphere and so forth the difference in my perspective is the us has bases literally all over the world there really is no strategic perimeter anymore for the us it is the world in my views you know so i think what's i don't think china is going to get to that point in our lifetimes but i feel like that is the long-term goal and i you know in terms of a power transition so i agree that i you know i love that term strategic permit or i think that i absolutely agree um that this is when i use the term strategic depth and security barrier that's essentially what i'm talking about so it's a different terminology but yes i i agree i think it's just a little bit beyond that um i did read andrew jupp's piece uh and i liked it also very much um and uh you know i i absolutely agree with with a lot of what he says and he's certainly more of a china expert than than i am uh in terms of history um and so i i wanted to focus just on the last 10 years mainly because i wanted to explain the um the very fast uh or i should say the the speed of which by which china really accelerated its uh actions in the south china sea so yes china you know this seized the you know mischa freeze in 1995 and in the 70s and you know there were different time periods you know the original claim was made in 1947 so it's not that this is a new thing so absolutely but to me this the 2009 uh note verbal and responses seemed to be a a real shift in in strategy and and and andrew acknowledges that you know as as one of the you know a surge uh but uh so you know if anything i could i could certainly reflect in the paper that this has been a long-term goal um at the same time though and you know um uh taylor fravil works a lot on you know chinese strategy and territory disputes and you know there this is a different animal also you know compared to as i said it's not a traditional territorial or maritime dispute because china really has had treated those disputes very differently than this um so it's hard to imagine uh you know a lot of in many cases china uses this this strategy of shelving the dispute you know and for a lot of time they did that's what they did with the south china sea and all of a sudden it became a really big deal and then china went full force ahead so to me that seems very indicative of something beyond what was happening before 2009 or in those years but so and yeah i know i mean there are other comments i could get but i want to uh i'll leave time for other comments and questions thank you so much thanks christa um i i i people are starting to warm up and we've got lots of questions here um i'm trying to group some of them and um there's a pair of i think quite related questions that go in different directions so i'm going to ask uh manjit saying padasi first to ask his question and then ben zela and if you don't mind we'll take those two together um because i i think that they are related mike manji do you want to ask your question sure uh thank you so much and thank you uh for a wonderful presentation uh i have to say that uh i really like some of your older work and your work on issue linkage in particular in territorial disputes has influenced my own work so it's been an absolute pleasure to hear you speak today i have two questions slash comments uh and my first one has to do with the south china sea east china sea comparison uh can it be argued that uh the united states has been less forceful in articulating its interests in the south china sea uh disputes than uh in the east china sea uh i mean uh mischief the 1970s paracels mischief reef 2012 scarborough but the u.s has not drawn any red lines whereas when it comes to the east china sea disputes uh obama said very clearly that you know these islands are covered by the treaty uh and so on so so why do you think uh that's the case and perhaps and i'm just trying to be contrarian perhaps china is trying to be opportunistic since china sees a strategic opportunity uh to expand its uh power for the exact reasons that you've mentioned um so perhaps it could be that and related to this is my second question uh which has to do with uh security driven behavior versus a power driven behavior so perhaps china could only expand into the paracels in the 1970s because of chinese capabilities and perhaps china can do more today because china's capabilities have grown so if that's the logic that is guiding chinese behavior then can we expect similar behavior you know outside this region maybe the south pacific maybe the indian ocean in the future and so on so in that sense china is not a security seeker but a power maximizer if you like thank you thank you thanks for the suggestions of those two angles i'm going to turn to benzela ben would you rather than me reading your question which you've kindly put up on the chat would you like to ask it yourself sure that's fine thanks evelyn and thanks christa that was a terrific paper i really really enjoyed it and learnt a lot um so yeah what i was asking about is it seems in your analysis from both in the paper and then what you were saying that really this link between the us military presence and the real dominance in northeast asia um is the key to the chinese strategic imperative in in the south china sea so in other words if you didn't have that perhaps china would be acting very very differently in the south china sea that's what there's nothing inherent to that geographic area that makes them act in that way it's because of that starting point so i guess i'm just asking does the logic of that um imply that really the only major factor that would shift chinese behavior at least the dynamics in the south china sea is some sort of change in the u.s presence in northeast asia and that could either be a change could be a draw down in some degree or it could be the opposite it could be increasing capabilities making the south china sea even more important um from the chinese perspective or do you think actually just other things in the kind of relative military balance between them could shift that so if this is about getting the ssbns out into the into the um waters of the western pacific or even down south and the other way to the indian ocean if china decided look it's too difficult to do this we're going to hedge in another way and double our land-based icbm force that could perhaps make the south china sea still important for the same reasons but just less so could you think of other ways of changing the dynamics thanks ben um so krista sorry to load you but again this this actually ben takes us in direction that relates to what natasha hamilton howard wants to ask so if you don't mind just going to slip in you know a third related natasha do you want to ask this um sure and i think i'm also curtailing on manjit's question as well and i guess this is a really basic question of um do we need the deterrence part of your framework because your conclusion the bottom line is is is number one china wants to deter u.s attack well of course but why would i mean really does china really fear a u.s attack um on on you know on the mainland um because of all of the last 70 years um there have been probably better times for the u.s to do this and i noted that on your side where you talked about um china's justifications for why this is a deterrent strategy use that phrase that it's a justification but i wondered if well is it really just you know is do you actually believe it um i mean if the u.s would somehow provide a credible reassurance to china that the us is purely a status quo power isn't going to threaten the mainland um would would we see anything different thanks very much that's quite a lot on your plate krista so please just feel free to take some of it away but address what you can here and i should add that for everyone who's putting your questions into the chat box we will ensure that krista gets a copy of them so that she can take them away and mull over them later on as well please krista thank you uh okay excellent questions uh this is this is great so uh majit and and also uh to ben's question i think they're both the about the northeast asia southeast asia and east tennessee south china sea connection uh so uh yeah it's it's very interesting but not surprising i think majit that the u.s is very uh has a very clear red line and a very clear definition that they will you know defend uh the senkaku uh islands uh and uh on behalf of japan but i think part of that you know where that hasn't been the case in the philippines i'm sorry uh in the south china sea uh particularly in regard to the philippines they can't you know the u.s doesn't it has a security partnership with with vietnam it's only since 2013 so it's that's a little more vague uh but uh you know i mean there there was a shift a slight shift in summer 2020 about that you know with um uh the mike pompeo saying there might you know we might be willing to uh you know don't you know to defend uh the philippines but nevertheless i do think uh you know and this gets more to ben's question too about the alliance system i think that that long term very very strong alliance system uh in with particularly with japan i mean korea is more indirect and of course we haven't seen korea play a role in in the south china sea japan has as part of the quad and and more broadly the indo-pacific korea's kind of stayed away but not just geographically but because of its relationship with china but japan the u.s japanese relationship is so strong and so you know airtight there is no way that you know china would be stupid right to try to challenge any of that that's just not that's a no-go right so and in the same with taiwan i mean that you know if you what made me actually think about this ben is when i looked at the map if you look at a map of east asia it's the south china sea is actually not ideal in the philippine archipelago really blocks the south china sea to get access to the you know the blue waters of the pacific beyond uh on the on the east side of the the open waters in other words of the pacific so it's not actually the most ideal i mean if you look at a map north and south of taiwan would be the most ideal i mean some of the parasol islands get that but they're not that far north um so to me it does seem uh you know if if if china wanted to have access um it would be through at different locations but they're they're held their you know their hands are tied they can't go through those channels so the south china sea is the best the next best thing i think i don't know if that's really true or not but i feel like that's what's going on so yeah if there were a draw down or an increase in northeast asia there might be a shift but i i don't see that happening you know any time uh soon uh so uh even even though japan is you know every few years you know we see more and more defense capabilities and a little more independence you know that i just don't see the us you know japanese alliance shifting um so with regard to the deterrence question that's a great great point and natasha i actually did think about that like is you see would the u.s really even attack no and and a lot of people like that's no way there's that's you know stupid no they would never do that but i think that you know from a broad long-term perspective thinking out to 2040 that's what we're talking about here is not today but up to 2040 as you know as china continues rising and this power transition may likely happen what is the u.s going to do is it going to sit back and say okay you know we're just going to let this happen or is the us going to try at least not to not to attack the mainland from like a war from an invasion perspective that's not going to happen nobody wants that but trying to take out missiles you know trying to take out things that are probably a provocative you know in a provocative way so i don't i you know i i don't think uh many people believe that there's gonna be a war but uh in in the near future but in the long term from a deterrence perspective i think you know that's that's where people are i think you know most people are thinking and that's kind of what where i was thinking from thanks krista um i think in in the course of that very comprehensive engagement the questions that were asked you've also answered some of the other questions that have been posted in the chat box already um i know that rohan mukherjee asked put in a question much earlier on and i think that there are certain points of conversation with what you've just said rohan did you want to come in on on this sure thank you very much thanks for the for the talk um i was just curious about sort of the discussion of alternative explanations and the sovereignty motive that he talked about and it seems to me that many of the things you pointed out as evidence of they're not being that um don't quite i mean i you can make the opposite argument as well right um and so in terms of observable observable implications i don't necessarily see much of a difference between projected returns and sovereignty so just a question about how we'd actually separate this those out better because the fable argument doesn't quite support it either because his argument is that china compromises when it's domestically weak which is less and less the case now so we would expect it to actually his argument predicts what we see even on sovereignty grounds so thanks yeah great question um so yeah i actually i had to clarify the last time i gave this talk and i clearly need to be careful in the paper as well about what i'm talking about i think you know there's no question that china wants control of these you know and whether it's sovereignty or not because they need to have they need to hold on to these military office you know and and brandon's right that there is a debate about whether china these these military outposts are that important and that you know and then can can china really actually defend them and are they really that important uh but from a sovereignty perspective what i think that alternative explanation is really more about is the legal angles the international law angle so that yes from a from a from a control territorial and maritime control perspective yes china that th the argument is not that different where it differs is that uh you know if you were to say well china has a legitimate claim from lee from a legal perspective based on historic precedent historic title uh and and that's what this is about um i think that's where i would would come in and say i'm not so i'm a little suspicious of that and there you know there's a great book uh by tom and gia i think who persua provided the the chinese perspective after the arbitration uh they wrote it during the arbitration i think it was 2014 or 2015. and and i when i read that they they just kept trying and trying and trying to make china's legal case like over and over and it was like this hollow like is it really really about that i just don't buy it like it's just to me so i do think that um that it's really more about the legal international law perspective like i don't think china wants to play the unclosed game in other words that's i guess more of what i'm trying to say rather than they don't want sovereignty does that make sense so that's but but thank you for that for for helping me try to clarify that thanks christa okay we have about 10 minutes to go and so i'm going to get really efficient at this point um curie park has a question that will take us more into the uh the region so so i'd like her to have a chance to ask you this and then after curie i'm going to take hunter marston's first question just the first question hunter um and then perhaps you can address them together curie yeah uh yeah thank you for sharing your work and i just wanted to ask this question as a researcher who examines security cooperation in the asia pacific so in your work you primarily focus on strong and tough behavior that china demonstrate to project power and deter rivals and i wanted to get your thoughts on what evidence of cooperation in the south china sea between china and southeast asian countries nowadays would mean for your projected deterrent theory so despite the tension like china is increasingly uh engaging in security cooperation activities was the country gender region for instance in 2018 there there was the first joint maritime exercise between china and afghan countries to practice the code of uh the code for unplanned encounters at sea to reduce uncertainty and build trust so what would um this kind of evidence of cooperation increasing in the region would mean for your projected uh deterrent theory thank you yes thanks uh thank you krista for the brilliant presentation i heard a lot from that um my question sort of builds on uh kyrie's uh perhaps um i'm wondering with your the the way you framed the paper around china's projected deterrence uh being being um based on uh china's wanting to push back on uh the us and deter the united states primarily i'm wondering how do how do the individual bilateral disputes with uh south china sea maritime uh claimants uh factor in are they subsumed under this larger um geopolitical uh struggle competition with the united states and uh sort of pairing that with um gary's question um i guess i'm wondering if these smaller states are just pawns uh what's in it for them why do they continue to hedge and cooperate on things like the code of conduct and uh declaration on code of conduct with uh china and south china sea thanks great questions thank you both uh so yeah i've always been i have to admit a little suspicious of the code of conduct and the declaration of conduct uh efforts and i have talked extensively to field of philippine officials also vietnamese men foreign affairs people um and i a little bit uh i know bruno i shouldn't mention brunei actually has is a dispute and two i always forget about them and i actually talked to them as well uh and a little bit with malaysians too and i'm always a little when i hear people they take it so seriously and i think you're right gary that and hunter that there are these bilateral relations going on their security cooperation and their their all of those states have to hedge for and it's not just because of the they're trying to uh you know persuade china not to seize more you know to harass them in the south china sea but clearly for economic reasons right and china's rising in rising a rise as an economic power uh in the region and and clearly the dominant economic power over the u.s uh they have to do that right they have to hedge so to me i think that there's the i would say these are almost like parallel tracks that are happening simultaneously so yes i you know i'm probably exaggerating that these are just pawns you know mere pawns in this in this bigger game but i also think these states are aware that they're pawns they know you know these officials i talked to in the philippines are fully aware that this is a bigger a much bigger game for china you know and they know this is the us is the primary target but they also view it in the cons in the perspective of the philippines as a us ally so when i first wrote this paper i actually had a very different approach and that was uh that these disputants were targeted as at an ally and in the case of vietnam a strategic partner in the other states as well as strategic partners and that they were kind of being manipulated uh not that they made up this dispute it's not that they just said oh we're just going to have this dispute for for the u.s to target the u.s but it's because of of these relationships in in the u.s uh concern about these southeast asian states that the us was drawn into this region in the first place right so because of the asia pivot and and so it's all kind of you know combined together so i don't think that i think these bilateral relations are happening the hedging is happening the states have to hedge you know against the us and with against china and and try to get what they can uh duterte has done a great job of that to some degree some people would say uh for for uh the philippines um so i don't think that they're just pawns but and i don't think you know i think that these these you know um coc talks have to continue but we should also be aware that there is a broader strategy going on that china is you know thinking about in a different context against the u.s so there's only going to be so much push and pull with those with those uh security cooperations and that unfortunately you know that's that's as good as it's gonna get i think i don't i mean if they would have signed it a decade ago if they were gonna sign it so you know to me it's it's a a bit of a shell game just to kind of move around you know things the shells and you know keep them going um uh but i i probably am more of a a skeptic than with these security cooperations and than many others thanks christa um on on the south china sea and southeast asian sort of imperatives to do with that i guess again at the risk of being a boar i mean i remind everybody of the geography of this obviously i mean you know china is much more than simply an economic power for southeast asian countries obviously um it is the resident power in the region um so when we talk about southeast asian countries hedging they're really hedging against two things right one they're hedging against the being let down by the united states right but two importantly they're also hedging against the possibility of chinese preponderance in the region one of these great powers could go anywhere any moment at once the other one won't go anywhere so the geography the resident nature of the power is is i think the thing that casts the major shadow over southeast asian the limits of southeast asian choices when it comes to thinking about uh strategic approaches to china and again that geography part i think um sometimes gets lost in in the discussion i'm not saying anything that my other colleagues who work in southeast asia here don't know but um we we have a couple of minutes nicely and i wanted to turn finally to sophie um sophie if i can ask you just to ask the first part of your question i think that would be a nice way to just take this discussion a little bit and give krista a chance to project forward a bit sofi are you happy to ask the part one of your question yeah sure thank you professor thank you for uh the wonderful talk uh krista um so uh the reason the the chinese coast guard law was uh established uh you know published earlier this month uh which legalized the coast guard's right to use the police equipment and weapons including handheld weapons whether born or airborne weapons under several circumstances how would that reflect china's positions uh in the south china sea thank you sorry thank you uh okay so yes the chinese coast guard law this is to me this is a further signal uh you know that i don't think china is going to be seizing any future features anytime soon i mean there's some concern about that but i think that for now uh the focus china's focus is primarily on continuing the seed control and the denial that determines by denial of freedom of navigation and making sure that uh the dispute in states uh other fishing vessels fishing vessels other uh vessels uh of the disputing states their own navies coast guards et cetera are not um able to to have that freedom of navigation so worth so uh yeah i think this is just a strong signal a further strong signal of compellence to stop you know it's it's it's a threat to use force uh if they don't if they don't stop doing you know with in in terms of freedom and navigation so i think that to me that's just a furthering of the strategy of compellence and it just furthers to me that's a more evidence that the the china's taking more risks you know or they're being more aggressive and more assertive in in the region um thanks very much for um your really nice presentation a really substantive meaty discussion as well with with people who've come to this seminar um i'm very pleased that you made time to join us and i hope that you found some of this useful for taking the paper forward as i said we'll send you what's been sent in the chat in terms of what's been written up as questions as well um so it's it's my uh pleasure then to sort of ask everybody to thank christa in the usual way in spite of being online thank you very much thank you so much and to remind everyone also that we have um seven more no sorry five more of these um women in asia pacific security seminars coming up the next of which will take place on the 29th of april it is a round table on what's so special about asian security and looking at non-traditional security issues and non-state actors so we'll be sending out the invitations and advertising for that pretty soon um we've got a whole series of exciting talks uh coming up after that as well so please look at our website for details again a reminder that we've put the link up right at the top of the chat stream to questus events page which includes a short reading list as well thank you very much everybody it's been wonderful to see you and thank you krista and we look forward to keeping in touch and eventually to seeing your paper in print great thank you all so much for your comments and feedback
zMBLEjg86pw,Fu Kuen-chen - South China Sea: Conflict Or Cooperation?,"For an area with the tiniest of populations, the South China Sea certainly gets a lot of attention from world leaders, military strategists, shippers, energy and fisheries planners, and the general public. A number of countries lay claim to islands and rocks in the 1.4 million square mile region. Much of the oil that powers the economies of China, Japan, and South Korea passes through the area. So does a huge share of global trade. China’s built air strips, the Philippines has gone to court, Vietnam and China have sparred over oil exploration, the United States has sailed ships and flown planes near the disputed islands and rocks, and last month, Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-jeou visited an island controlled by Taiwan’s military, but claimed by three other governments. The region deserves the attention its getting.

Prof. Fu is dean of Xiamen University's South China Sea Institute, an institute which builds on the university's decades-long efforts to study the region and, particularly, maritime law. He is among the scholars recruited through China's ""Thousand Talents"" program (千人计划) and also heads the Center for Oceans Law and Policy at Shanghai Jiaotong University. Fu was educated at National Taiwan University and the University of Virginia and is a leading scholar of maritime law. He previously taught at National Taiwan University and other universities in Taiwan and Hong Kong and he has served as a member of Taiwan's legislature. He's written and edited dozens of books in English and Chinese. The first of these, published in 1981, focused on SCS resources and the most recent of which have looked at topics including cross-strait commercial law, the Cairo Declaration and Sino-Japanese ties, and U.S. Coast Guard maritime enforcement practices. Fu is also editor of China Oceans Law Review and the South China Sea Bulletin.",0,my topic here today is on the Chinese u-shaped line in the South China Sea briefly because I have limited time some history and legal issues will be brought up by me I have been teaching and working in Taiwan for many years and of course I've been doing a lot of other jobs in Hong Kong in Russia in mainland China or so this is the South China Sea as you can see that Gulf of Thailand is part of this semi-enclosed to see this is important very recently two weeks ago actually american scholar together with a Taiwanese Carter published the book in Taiwan and in English and they included in their book and map be marketed a line between Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea that's misleading Gulf of Thailand and gulf of tonkin Tonkin Bay up in the northern part of it are both scoffs of this semi close to Z and according to uncross United Nation convention law of the sea article 1 23 this is a community of enclosed semi-clothed see and littoral states around this water area have their rights and duties to coordinate with each other for the following subject matters environmental protection preservation of living resources marine scientific research and some other you know you know resource oriented matters but anyway this is the South China Sea and this is the map we have seen minimaps some we said this continued you know real blind circle the some ways dotted line you know somehow you know broken strange lines but these are all not the line realign published in 1947 by the Chinese government was like this pay to pay attention to two matters why is each section of this u-shaped line is not just a dash line is a line consists of dash parentheses thought dash parentheses start dash parentheses start and that way of lying was used and is still used in many other countries map as a national boundary line but it was discontinued notice this not a continued line pay attention number two is that the here you have a branch from this line separating the Philippines Palawan Island and East Malaysia Brunei so what does this line mean is very clear it's a national boundary line but if this continue exactly like those discontinued national boundaries on land in the 40s 50s and 60s in the previous decades we have found that all those unsettled land boundary line of China are settled today with only two exceptions why is part of this boundary between India and China the other is the boundary line between boudin and China the unsettle part is only 500 meters and nobody really want to settle it today so it was like that all the other long long land boundary lines settled are settled today by what by arbitration by any third party education no by negotiation the very basic diplomatic talks and here we have some difficulties it's not settled yet so legally speaking why is this you know gentlemen and ladies I've been teaching law of contract for years in China including Taiwan Hong Kong Shanghai and even in Beijing on some occasions also I have been teaching Anglo American law of contract so sometimes in rushing or in in Seattle I would have the chance to talk about the Chinese and comparative law of contract encounter a gesture like this does not constitute an offer because if it's a offer why's it is accepted immediately an agreement is reached and you will be binding for the offer so these kind of discontinued national boundary line offered in 1947 two years after the 1945 two men proclamations was intended as an invitation to negotiate in contract law we call the invitation to offer then you have a chance to negotiate so you could regard this as a kind of working line before any agreement can be reached for example in year two thousand and four between China and Vietnam in this gulf of tonkin or token Bay a boundary line was demarcated after negotiation but unfortunately this is the only maritime boundary line between China and its neighboring countries in this region okay other countries have not yet initiated or accepted the invitation by China to negotiate for the maritime boundary okay so what about water within this you supplies international water as the US naval people say no what is international water in one clause in the convention there is no such a term when they mention this international water they meant hi see that is the legal term used by the convention but is it hi-c obviously not because all these water areas within the u-shaped line was encircled by some countries exclusive economic zone and very seriously overlapping Lee claimed by this count is this you know what is territorial seas or contiguous oh of course not you know what some of them are but not everyone not all those you know what areas because territorial sea would be 12 nautical mile actually exactly speaking you should be within or not exceeding to have not commenced all these figures to have 24 not my contiguous zone 12 nautical miles or Z or 20 nautical mile SE are all series the maximum claim claimable claimable in distance you can claim from the baseline measure measuring the territorial sea but anyway it is easy of course not in you know within this you apply not all easy of China okay easy strictly defined hi-c strictly defined hi-c means the water area beyond 200 nautical miles coastal states it easy all these are answers for these questions are no no no and no so what is it a lot of people ask this question let me be honest to you there's no other answer you can find except historic water within a u-shaped line Chinese people have tons of historic evidence indicating that we have you know seriously managed the water area for security purpose for anti-piracy purpose for defending foreign invaders for marine scientific research and for measuring the shadows of the heavenly bodies completely in the UN dynasty more than roughly 600 years ago so you see we have all those are not to mention i forgot the most important fishery okay catching features so whenever I talk about South China Sea issues I'm I exist to mention three levels of them level number one is the all standing close to see according to a loan closed article provisions visual states enjoy those kind of rights and duties coordinate with each other so it's a community second level is the u-shaped line where the Chinese is with their evidences enjoyed their historical rights as to what kind of rice and what other items of this riot II can claim find it out from the history evidences if you don't have that evidence you don't enjoy that right for example drilling for oil and gas do we ever drill for oil and gas within the YouTube line in the previous hundreds if not two thousand years where Han Dynasty discovered and record it recording their navigation activities in South China Sea no there's no such right based on historical evidences then you some people say ah then Chinese cannot drill for oil and gas within a u-shaped line lenses no you're wrong of course they can drill for all your guests based on what baseball across the convention China as a contracting party state enjoys the right to drill for oil and gas from the land area extending for its territorial sea or easy or extended from the land into the seabed the submerged land mass of continental shaft which is actually today's scientific definition of continental margin which includes continental shop continental slope and continent to rice so you see it's a sort of complicated matter then this level number three would be the islands and 12 nautical mile territorial sea around it where the coastal state which is China enjoys sovereignty today the very basic issue we are facing here is who owns the islets because in United Nations Convention law of the sea enclose it has been a very clearly defined principle flaw that land controls the see if you don't enjoy the right of land you don't enjoy the right of the sea extended imagine from the pace line of it that's it so here we are facing a real core issue is it an artificial island China is building constructing in the spread islands for young soldier to PG are no these are not that if you hide it because they were idle already when we study the construction jobs what is the definition of island let me recite the provision for you a piece of land not your smaller surrounded by water and merged at height I either in the same article of article 121 paragraph 3 3 mentioned that rocks which cannot sustain is human is squid cannot sustain human habitation or its own economic life cannot enjoy to enjoy nautica myers or continental shelf period what does this mean it means rocks are islands in the same article of region of item this is only paragraph 10 paragraph 3 so these rocks are still islands if they are load higher elevations then they are not rocks but what is it definite uno de elevation Lhota and the visions are those land mass submerged under the sea even at low tide they could merge temporarily by the Hittite disappeared again that's not high elevation but even for lo de elevation sometimes it could still enjoy 200 miles of easy how come let me explain this to you it's complicated it's a matter of lawyers by definition if a load high elevation locates completely up actually within the territorial sea then from that point you can use it as a base point when you team arcade you straight baseline not normal baseline which is low tide baseline quality market your straight baseline that kind of point is legitimate point then from that point based one you can measure to engine optimize it easy so you see even load higher elevations are very important but if Filipinos are trying to cheat the arbitration tribunal saying that all these islands spread a lot higher elevations nonsense all those who are stationed you know who are having human habitation are only rocks not islands and they cannot claim for 200 nautical miles they want some explanation from the arbitrator's I've been doing arbitrations believe me it is the duty of any arbitrator any justice charges deciders to pierce the veil in companied off we have lawyers here today incoming though there is a so-called principle of piercing the corporate veil why the judge has to appear ah we have I'm only five minutes left so while you will be difficult for me to complete anything but anyway believe me it's the duty of arbitrators to find out the truth but they are not their only listening to love the Filipinos who say this and they want to make their money by doing the arbitration jobs and they will pay by our billable hours and okay so these are not artificial islands they are islands and okay let me skip this but why these islands are Chinese islands by occupation the Filipinos also mentioned that they by occupation preserve Africa they have these islands owned by themselves these are not correct let me say these mentioning three points textbooks croma brothers expiration stories and us request permission to visit the spread items in nineteen sixty some people say that when you say that you demarcated your night involved in 1947 UT market leadership blind and claim all items within these islands or Chinese territory we didn't even know you demarcated a line many people believed so because they really didn't know it but they were private individuals in other countries the countries realized very clearly in 1945 Chris President Truman issued two presidential proclamations one study the concept of easy you live within reasonable distance of my goals if you want to fish you get my permit first another presidential proclamation mention that well next to my coastline with the shadow water area with the average depth of no more than 200 meters the submerged land containers job on my area if you want drill for oil and gas you get my permit that kind of presidential proclamation were issued and then after that 1945 action many countries began to draw lines at see some 200 nautical miles some 300 nautical mile some 150 some 50 some 25 some 35 China with the help of the United States Naval office demarcated the u-shaped line in 1947 and issued in December these three cases would prove that people realize that in the 1940s and the previous and in the later years the uShip lines existed in 1940s and 50s these are some of books are discovered from the used book stamp in Jakarta when I was younger a visitor jakarta many times I once I you know crowd into the audience then they find out some dusty use the books and I bother them all and these are very interesting evidences this book of history published in nineteen forty million nineteen nineteen fifty ok and then approved by you know the Indonesian government for the overseas Chinese school in Indonesia to use and look at these records and you read them you'll find the recording and acknowledged the history and occupation of the South China Sea and then this book published in nineteen nineteen fifty-nine dream okay and this book mentioned also boundary of China and how the French tried to invade and occupy la small islands of China in asp ready and China expert them this kind of saw end here you have this u-shaped lined and area indicated of South China Sea and then this book published in nineteen fifty-five with this u-shaped line even gem show was demarcated as the southernmost point ok I have only one minutes then here in 1957 and published in Jakarta yearsin means Joe cada an approved pilot in the initial Ministry of Education and you have this I noticed they existed to deleted all those words of war from my country to China every word of my country had to be they were forced to be changed to China not my country because this is Indonesia not your country but all these books have this map & islands demarcated and this book also in 1957 approved with this map and this book also you know with this map this is the map 1947 so another case is Thomas chroma in the year of 1956 the chroma brothers and their students they sailed and discovered terra nullius nobody owned the land the so they call them freedom land hawaiian islands and then they invited this and reporting tool manila and two weeks later the filipino government proclaimed that we have discovered terra nullius and we have enclosed into our land us Clarence in 1956 g we did it two thousand years ago in 1953 discovered then what is important is that in the same year okay the whole story started from early 56 and ended in later 56 Mr Comber returned the map to the Chinese embassy in manila the map listo from E to ABBA type in town and everything and they apologized and these are the records of Chinese government all these evidences were included in a disk I gave you so you may find it interesting all these materials and this is something more interesting that before returning a map on the vessel of a Chinese naval office of Chinese Navy the the captain of the ship mr. coloma signed a letter of apology mentioning that they have been nicely treaty and nothing was moved from their board but they agreed not to return to the territory water of China and if they did they are willing to accept any treatment you know according to the ROC law or international law and this is the letter signed and then the last case is the u.s. request permission to visit in 1960 December 21 just take a look of this here 1960 December 21 and this is whom head quarter of the US Armed Forces in San Francisco they said that time they had a common defense treaty with Taiwan and other countries against the PRC the Communist PRC not today's PRC okay but anyway here they request permission to visit North danger synchro and spread the islands the request permission from the Chinese coming with all the names of beastie and a purpose of them activities they are also included in a city so enjoy it you know the legal status of the USA brain is very clear it's a very humble reasonably designed invitation to negotiate but misled by many people by filipinos Americans and Japanese they want to say that Chinese enclosed almost the whole area of South China Sea and China claimed all islands in a sergeant as the territory out of the UC blind believe me there are many many other better Islands very close to gem show there's in natuna island and very nice islands not one item paliku violent and natural resource reserved and the water in that i dint area equals to the total amount of natural gas on java in china never came so my conclusions like this some people create these tiny chinese and saying that your policies what is the mines my what is used to steal myers no you're wrong our principal repeatedly by tential peeing johnson me and my enjoying taiwan is like this what is my smile what is my bus stolen by you is to mine but we are still willing to share the resources that's all status but very much mislead and very much criticized and fairly so this is really unfortunate that Chinese people like America but America is pushing China behind a reverie line today people in men and China and Taiwan get more and more uneasy about United States government's policy in a South China Sea so let us think about it corporation or convict mr. Dube can have the conclusion for you thank you very much

© 2022 The B1M Limited",1,this is one of the world's biggest construction projects a 7.5 billion dollar feat of engineering that's going to transform travel across an entire continent and it's happening here on the quiet German island of female let me explain this is the scan-med corridor it's the northern access of the trans-european transport Network and it spans nearly 5 000 kilometers from Malta in the Mediterranean to finland's icy Tundra along the way it drills through Alpine mountains and crosses the sea but follow the route North and something strange happens instead of being able to go straight on to Sweden you have to take this 500 kilometer detour through Denmark and it's all because of this a stretch of water between Germany and Denmark called the female belt so let's just get this straight there's currently a 55 kilometer tunnel being dug through a mountain in Austria there's an epic bridge and tunnel Link in Denmark and Sweden there's another massive Bridge linking two Danish Islands but we can't get over this it might not look like much but this unassuming structure of water has thwarted the plans of the world's best Engineers for decades until now this is one of Europe's largest construction sites it will be the longest the most tunnel in the world no there's no instruction manual for building anything like this the fastest route between Scandinavia and Central I mean the rescue is that people never stop maybe they just pass through what are your concerns with this game they're just trying our nature we're building the Finland belt tunnel between Denmark and Germany you might not heard a female or a tunnel but this is one of the most technologically advanced Mega projects on the planet absolutely enormous like an aircraft hangar in here and it kind of epitomizes the power of construction and its ability to change our world oh wow this is absolutely incredible you get those moments of infrastructure where they nail both the engineering and the architecture and they kind of come together I saw it on the Elizabeth Knight did it really well lovely Railway get the same feeling here I am currently driving over the Harrison Bridge one of the world's most incredible fields of engineering probably one of its best infrastructure projects it's this structure that links to countries it links Denmark and Sweden this is where the whole story starts when this was being planned that Sweden had a big idea [Music] so right now to get from Sweden down into Central Europe we have to catch a train here at Malmo that takes you over the Arizona Crossing to Copenhagen where you have to change onto another train that eventually takes you over to Hamburg and down into Germany even on a high speed train that takes you five and a half hours and for freight trains it's even slower Germany is Sweden's second biggest export market so that's a huge deal the Swedish government saw a shortcut here at the female belts so they said to Denmark will help you build the Arizona bridge if you look into the possibility of a new fixed Link in the waters behind me fortunately that request wasn't as outrageous as you might think so here's Denmark and this is the German island of fimon which gives the femon belt its name now there's been talk of creating a railway between Hamburg and Copenhagen since the 19th century but nothing really happened until the 60s when a bridge was built here that route was then extended to a new ferry port at put Garden bringing trains right up to the water's edge amazingly the trains were then loaded onto ferries and carried over the female belts and on to Denmark the whole thing was pretty slow diesel trains weren't as fast as the ones we have today and the ferry itself took around 45 minutes for years people talked about the idea of a fixed link between these two countries a bridge or a tunnel but it wasn't until Sweden threw down the gauntlet that things got really serious it was way back in 2008 that the Danish and German governments first signed a treaty to start work on the female belt fixed link there was a lot at stake the idea was to replace the ferry with a new permanent Crossing it would have a four-lane Motorway and two Rail lines serving both Freights and high-speed passenger trains and the whole thing would be funded by Denmark who would also collect the 12th bears and run the onshore businesses separately Germany would upgrade the route from put Garden to Lubeck to allow for the new trains and traffic to pass through that would also involve building another much shorter tunnel to the German Mainland here at fiemann's sound it would be a once a generation upgrade of the transport Network the Hamburg to Copenhagen Corridor would be transformed into a high-speed rail and Road Route the swedes would get their shortcut to the continent a massive detour would be wiped off the scammed corridor and that in turn would transform The Wider trans-european transport Network the only thing that stood in the way was the water [Music] the most obvious solution was a bridge this is what they came up with a three kilometer long cable stayed Bridge sitting 65 meters above the water so that ships could still pass underneath it probably reminds you of the urasand bridge and it would have been similar but nearly three times as long and that's where the problems began you see the female belt is awkward from there to there is just under 20 kilometers and that's further than the earth and the bridge had to cross also the depth of the water out there in the Baltic Sea is just over 40 meters and the soil conditions aren't great for building on that all meant the bridge would have needed spans of over 700 meters and nothing like that has ever been built before for a combined Road and rail Bridge the plan was for three huge pylons each just under 300 meters tall the foundations of those would have to be built at Sea in depth for up to 25 meters throw in poor soil conditions and a busy shipping Lane and you have an engineer's idea of hell then as you'll have gathered from my trip on the ferry there's the wind now some of the world's biggest Bridges the errison bridge the Chinook lay bridge in turkey or the Epic Hong Kong Macau Crossing all share a common trait they all more or less run horizontally from east to west a bridge crossing the female would have had to go from north to south meaning that every train truck car and YouTube are trying to make a video would get battered by the prevailing winds blowing from west to east so after careful consideration of the risk to the cost overrun and the technical complexities of construction the bridge was firmly ruled out if you can't go over you've got to go under but it's okay because the theme on Belt is a pretty good place for a broad tunnel [Music] now there's a few reasons why boar tunnels are great first off they don't disturb anything above ground that's why they're usually used for underground Railways in cities but that's also great for a place like fimon which has a delicate ecosystem that could take years to recover from all the disruption caused by building a bridge they are expensive but they become more economical the further you go so the team Returns the possibility of a board tunnel under the female belt but that's who hit a snack board tunnels are dug by a tunnel boring machine or TBM the width depends on the TBM but something like London's new Elizabeth line used machines around 7 meters wide they're good for something like an underground Railway because you have one track per tunnel but FEMA needs a railway Motorway and an access tunnel that could mean boring five tunnels at five times the cost and that's not all [Applause] very little of a train's surface area actually sits on the track and because its wheels are made of steel or at least they are in real life there's very little traction on flat tracks that's great it's one of the reasons why trains are so fast and efficient but going uphill becomes a bit more challenging the average Mainline train can drive upwards by 2.5 percent or one in 40 meaning that for every 40 meters of track the train can move upwards by one meter the FEMA belt tunnel sits 40 meters deep any board tunnel would have to be 10 meters below that and Incredibly long in order for a train to travel into it pass under the ocean and then successfully climb out again the other side a shorter tunnel would create a train track that's incredibly steep and any train probably wouldn't make it so a bridge was too difficult a board tunnel was too expensive things weren't looking good thankfully there was one more option on the table the immersed tube tunnel now I know what you're thinking finally another shot of Fred bells on the beach a freezing cold beach in the Baltic the way this tunnel's built is actually pretty straightforward first of all you create your tunnel segments in a nice dry Factory on the land then instead of digging a deep tunnel underneath the Sleep bed you just dig a trench in the bottom of the seabed then you take your tunnel elements and lay them in one by one sing them together as you go then you cover the whole thing over thank you and hey Presto you've got a tunnel it's a great solution for a place like fimon you don't have to build a bridge where you're going to be subject to the wild weather and the ocean you'd have to dig a deep tunnel which wouldn't really work for a train and shipping lanes above stay open keep driving over the Earth bridge and you suddenly hit a man-made Island and then drop down under the ocean I'm driving under the walls right now this is very very cool this is the drogden tunnel which is itself on IMT this is like a preview of what's going to be built down in Fremont now some people have asked why go through the hassle of building a tunnel than a man-made Island and a bridge up here at the Arizona Crossing and it basically exists because of Copenhagen airport because the restrictions to do with height around that imts are usually used for Fairly short distances like rivers and harbors this is one of the longest imts in the world and it's only four kilometers the femon tunnel will be five times longer making it an immense feat of engineering so how the heck do you build something this big it starts here I'm currently standing in rugby Hound on the Danish side of the female belt and on one of the biggest construction sites in Europe it's all run by the Danish state-owned company theme on as and this place is so big that it's taken them two years just to build the work area the place is a hive of activity there's a village with 1300 workers a specially built Harbor for material deliveries and the northern portal where the tunnel across the surface but the star of the show is easily the massive building behind me this is the factory where the tunnel segments are going to be made it's one of the biggest factories ever built in Denmark altogether covering half a million square meters that's around 200 football pitches these buildings are vast because they need to be the 89 enormous concrete tunnel elements that will be constructed here will each be 220 meters long and 40 meters wide that's so they can fit two Railway tunnels two Motorway tunnels and a service route all side by side building an IMT tunnel under the ocean works like this initially the team constructed a new work Harbor on the coast so that materials could be brought to the site by sea that's enabling them to build these enormous tunnel Factory buildings that'll contain six production halls in total once fully up and running these factories will be on 24 hours a day seven days a week for three and a half years Aggregates and materials will be delivered to the work Harbor and then taken by conveyor belt to the factories in here each of the 89 tunnel elements will be cast but they're so big they're actually formed of nine segments actually it takes 36 hours to pass one segment it has a very very detailed plan like if you are baking in a gnome Advanced cake it has to be the right temperature before you go to the next layer next layer not too much not too cold not too hot not too wet not too dry and then it's in 36 hours they have made one segment and we have to make sure that the concrete are running for all 36 hours once a tunnel element is constructed it'll be rolled out of the factory and taken here to the upper Basin where huge doors will close behind it rather like a lock the Basin will then be flooded ballast tanks will enable the element to float and tugboats will move each element down to the lower Basin and then out to sea they're then taken out here where the trench they're going to sit in is currently being duck now that's the first challenge this project throws up imts normally sit 20 meters deep This is 40 meters once the trench is ready the next step of getting a 73 000 ton concrete tunnel element to the bottom of the ocean isn't too difficult its ballast tanks are simply flooded and gravity does the rest but getting each element into the right place is much harder along the entire 18 kilometer route they have to land within 15 millimeters of their targets to make the whole thing watertight the tunnel elements are fitted with something called a Gina gasket at one end once laid in the trench next to another segment the water is pumped out of the space between the two bulkheads creating a partial vacuum this pulls the two concrete elements together and the junior gasket gets squashed in between them creating a seal once all the elements are in place the trench is backfilled and the tunnel is covered in gravel to protect it at this point nature takes over and eventually covers the gravel bed with sand then there's just a small matter of fitting the whole thing out with lighting ventilation and Motorway and a railway before the whole thing opens in 2029 that's basically it easy right thank you [Music] wow it's absolutely epic the size of it is huge [Music] on paper the process seems logical and practical but seeing it up close you can't help but feel dwarfed by the immense scale of both its ambition and its engineering well this is production hobby which is one of free Productions Hall where we will be casting the tunnel elements for the filter built tunnel this is one is the furthest ahead of the three it's 98 completed the right now as we're entering they're just busy setting up the internal cranes the formworks and all the equipment we need for casting the elements absolutely enormous like an aircraft hangar in here it is you could easily Park a 747 or two in here wow this has actually been pretty fast we've been working on the factory side here what we call the PFA the production facility area for about a year so everything you see here is basically shot up out of nowhere over the last 12 months what keeps these Engineers awake at night is not whether they're foundations and calculations are correct but the sheer Logistics of getting all these tunnel segments built and out to sea in an orchestrated way there isn't anywhere big enough to store them so as soon as they're made they've got to be taken straight out to sea [Music] to make sure nothing stops the production schedule once it started Engineers have been practicing and honing nearly every step of the process I've now got the chance to get up close to a test segment that's been constructed this behind me is just one of the rail tunnels from one end of a tunnel segment and you can see when I'm standing in front of it the immense scale of this project well this is our test bed where we are testing our production method our forms our crews and of course the concrete that we're going to use to cast the tunnel elements what we're actually learning is not not even two real times not one and a half rail tunnel here the actual standard elements will be 42 meters wide but it's big enough for us to experience the scaling issues that are involved in building something like this though there's no instruction manual for building anything like this you know we are we are learning as we go and we've learned a lot about the importance of communication between our crews and the way our concrete behaves over the casting period and we're going to take all that know-how and make a few more minor scale casts before the real deal starts up at the end of the year what's being built here is proof of how construction is constantly learning and evolving 30 years ago when the urison bridge was being planned a tunnel like this wouldn't have been deemed feasible principles of this task construction are the same as any other tunnel from Sweden to Hong Kong but our Knowledge and Skills have now Advanced to a level where we can go deeper and further than ever before when this tunnel completes in 2029 thousands of cars and hundreds of trains are going to pass through it every day and that's going to be a game changer not just for Denmark and Germany but for the wider continents but it all costs a lot of money around 7.5 billion US dollars a half a billion of that is coming from EU subsidies and the rest is coming from a loan underwritten by the Danish State crucially Danish taxpayers won't have to spend a single penny now the cost of the tunnel is going to be repaid over time by the revenue that comes from tolls on cars it's likely the car is going to be charged about the same as the ferry about 100 euros to use the tunnel and it's projected that Denmark could receive around 4 billion US dollars in profits during the first 50 years of the tunnel's life so improving infrastructure creating green travel corridors and billions of dollars in profits what could possibly be the problem ah [Music] it's not just the theme on belt's geography that this construction team have had to battle campaigners on the German side of the sea have forged tooth and nail for the last decade to prevent the construction of a permanent Crossing I've been coming here as a child it's the most sunniest spot in Germany even if it's a little a little colder than in the in the South it's one of the most sunniest spot in Germany and up to now it's very silently you've got a landscape you've got the free ocean you can go swimming you can do water sports this is the downside of massive construction projects any new Mega scheme has to be built somewhere whether that's in a virgin forest in the middle of a city or on a quiet German Holiday Island whether you like it or not it's going to have a massive impact they're just trying our nature they're just trying the the foundation for our economics and that is trying the foundation for ecologics we have here some people worry about the impact this construction project will have on the unique ecosystem of the female belt the marine life in this area of the Baltic Sea thrives on clear water conditions and the concern is that digging the trench for the tunnel is going to disturb that Ecology of the female bird is very diverse the clouding in the female bed will reduce the growth of macrophytes of Plankton will have of course the repercussions on all living fauna and Marine Flora Simon as say sedimentation is one of the most closely monitored environmental impacts on this project they say they use special dredging machines to minimize The Spill and have Patrol boats and monitoring stations around the dredging site to collect data on water clouding this and other environmental data is published in real time on the Fremont as website in an attempt to improve transparency around the construction but it's not just the Marine environments that Hendrick and Isabel's organization is concerned about a big feature that's been touted with this new tunnel is its ability to kind of create a green link with the continent femon as say that because the distance between Hamburg and Copenhagen is being shortened thousands of vehicles will have to drive 150 kilometers less the new rail service will take cargo off of lorries and put it onto freight trains and the new Rail Link will make taking the train a more attractive option as well as wanting to improve Freight connections the swedes are also very keen to avoid something called flu strike is that right blue strike flu strike and pretty much want to make taking the train easier than flying as much as possible that idea is gaining Traction in April 2022 France banned all internal flights under two hours and other countries are considering doing the same if that's going to catch on then good High-Speed Rail links like this are essential but and this is a big but constructing something as ambitious as the Female Tunnel comes with a huge carbon footprint mostly from the vast amounts of concrete being produced only the fabrication of these concrete tunnel will produce 2 million tons of carbon dioxide female as say that the female belt tunnel is a generational investment in a Greener and climate-friendly transport Corridor in Europe once completed the tunnel will deliver a significant contribution to the green trans-european Traffic Corridor by creating a 160 kilometer shortcut creating a viable alternative to air traffic and shifting goods from trucks to electrified freight trains they added that they're making a concerted effort to reduce the CO2 footprint of construction but that it's not possible to build at this scale without causing some emissions just one of the initiatives Is our commitment to use 100 renewable energy sources for construction and operations of the tunnel Fremont is beautiful and you should keep it like that not changing it into a transport spot [Music] the structure comes into contact with the natural world how couldn't it that doesn't mean that concerns should just be brushed aside it also doesn't mean that we should never build infrastructure ever again what Isabelle expresses are legitimate anxieties from people living on the doorstep of one of Europe's biggest construction projects when there is a good cause for a new Mega project it's important that project teams listen to concerns and work to reduce the impact of their work on people's lives and the environments as far as possible that's something this project has set out to do from the start most of the construction activity is being done on the less populated Danish side of the water and new habitats are being built to compensate for land now occupied by the factory foreign [Music] critics of the fixed link say that the whole project is speculative and that there's no way of definitively confirming whether or not it was worth the money that's true and it's the case with almost every other infrastructure Mega project out there the same was said about the Eurozone bridge and it's now a revered structure that millions of people rely on tourism is a big part of this Island's economy and it could take a hit during construction but in the long run it could benefit from the improved connectivity over the next decade a new route will be tattooed onto this part of the map and for the people who use it its convenience will quickly erase any memory of the enormous effort that it took to make it happen [Music] the bridge behind me is 60 years old and links the other side of fear man with the German Mainland it was vehemently opposed when it was first constructed but now with the construction of another new tunnel under this stretch of water people are concerned for its future they're worried it might fall into disuse or even disrepair that for me is the story of modern infrastructure yes these products are difficult and controversial to realize when they're first constructed but they go on to have a defining impact on all of our lives the new tunnel under the female belt will impact millions of people across this continent over the decades to come any of the controversies around its construction will likely be forgotten and the extraordinary engineering that went in were taken for granted [Music] as always guys if you enjoyed this video and you want to get more from

Forbes covers the intersection of entrepreneurship, wealth, technology, business and lifestyle with a focus on people and success.",1,generative AI is in a sense the second wave of transformative AI that we've experienced over the past few decades and that first wave was really around ranking systems and so you're thinking here about Google search Facebook YouTube's recommendations Tick Tock all of this is around choosing sort of the ranking of information that was already created by people and this seems like a small thing it's just ranking a set of items but when you're ranking everything that Humanity has created that actually affects the incentives of politicians of entertainers of journalists you're now restructuring Society just by that simple Act of ranking because you're ranking for billions of people every day all the time the second wave is where we go beyond ranking to actually generating that content this second wave of transformative artificial intelligence we don't know fully what those implications are going to be the whole way in which we make information and the basis of communication across Society like that is all going to be rewired [Music] at its simplest generative AI refers to an AI tool that is generating or creating content that could be text audio or video you're taking a really large data set and you're inputting a prompt and then you're outputting something completely new that is learning from all that info and creating something to answer the prompts we've covered AI for some time at Forbes but on November 30th when openai launched chat GPT it's tool that allows you to you know ask for a recipe or a sauna in the form of Shakespeare or a script in the form of you know Alex as movie star which my boss did he also asked it to write an annual performance review for me which I did not appreciate well we saw everyone playing with these tools we thought okay AI is really breaking into the mainstream here it's not just something that the tech bubble cares about and it's time to ask questions about who's really gonna make money here how real is this hype and what will be the business impacts openai is a really interesting company it actually started as a non-profit it was backed by Sam aldman who used to run my combinator as well as the billionaires Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and it was formed with the idea of creating an artificial general intelligence this is a real kind of sci-fi AI one that is conscious self-learning that could theoretically rethink capitalism as Sam almond has said or could potentially outstrip human Control building that AGI was something that openai could not do as a non-profit it couldn't raise enough money to do this so it needed to create a for-profit entity openai does that in 2019 and that's when Sam Allman becomes CEO full-time and not long after we've seen the company become a key Allied to Microsoft which has reportedly invested 10 billion dollars recently at a 29 billion dollar valuation foreign this current wave that we're seeing this generative AI wave has been kind of building up for the last couple months now really hitting an inflection point probably summer of 2022 we were slowly seeing these different companies starting to tease out you know new releases like open AI launching Dolly 2 and beta and then stability AI announced stable diffusion this text to image generation model I think really it was the culmination of all these different models that reached a viral moment you know really got to the masses I would characterize the consensus as cautiously optimistic you know I think there's not so much pessimism around like AI as a technology anymore I think more than like optimism it's kind of gotten to a point where people are accepting that this is an inevitability now what do we do with this inevitability you know different folks have different levels of bullishness on where this technology can take us or what the potential harms and risks of it are but uh for the most part people seem to be optimistic that we still have time it's still kind of in our hands to kind of control the destiny that this new AI Paradigm Shift brings I think the way to look at this is if Steve Jobs said that you know the phone was a bicycle for the mind this technology is really a rocket ship for the mind the most exciting application I think of this generative AI is with what we're building allowing humans to communicate visually so you can take what's in your mind and create it almost instantly whereas before it would have taken days or months even for skilled individuals to do that via art or PowerPoint or whatever else I think we've also seen the impact of this also emerging other sectors such as education where students are now using it to help with their homework structuring or writing I think we'll see it across everything whereby again anything you can imagine you'll be able to create now stability or differential is that we are open source so we release our models so there's an amazing Community that's built around it if you look at popularity on the code base it's outstripped things like Bitcoin in ethereum in a few months what took them 10 years the types of applications that we're seeing are largely around basic creativity at the moment but now they are extending into combining these things to create video game assets to create artwork of various types to create new textures and things like that to extend the capabilities of creators and to make more people creators I think where it goes from here I think we'll see more and more business workflow use cases definitely expect to see these big tech companies like Microsoft and Google that are building some of these models and kind of working with companies like open AI on these models to start integrating them more deeply into some of the existing software we know so for example you could expect to see generative AI use cases in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Outlook Google Docs stuff like that I think one of the open questions remains are we going to see like an entirely new wave of uh AI native applications kind of become a whole new gen generation of software tools that people use or will it be kind of the existing options that are able to integrate this AI faster and stay ahead of the curve for example Adobe putting this AI into Photoshop versus entirely new like AI powered photo editor coming about speaking of Bill Gates about AI I was honestly a little surprised just how excited he was I asked him how does this compare to previous technological Cycles like the the rise of the PC or the PC with you know Graphics interfaces that allow us to play games and do a lot more you know graphically inclined things on computers or even the internet itself and Bill said that he thinks this is one of the four big technological changes of his lifetime and he said that he thinks AI will deservedly be the hottest topic of this year overall I would say Bill Gates was optimistic about the impact that these AI tools could have particularly in the developing world where he spends a lot of his thoughts with his foundation he was thinking about how in Africa some people may not have access to human doctors you can do a lot as a foundation to try to get doctors to that place or train new doctors but an AI tool that could answer some basic medical questions could fill a need without challenging doctors professions similarly he was thinking in you know lower income neighborhoods here at home in the U.S there might be some math tutoring or basic homework support or teaching support but a tool like this could use for students who don't have access to human Tutors or don't have a lot of time with a teacher so with AI you can do existing use cases better than before right so you can improve search for example you can improve moderation in social networks you can improve communication by adding uh virtual backgrounds for example to to this video you can also create completely new use cases that were just not possible before right you can generate image Club text you can generate 3D context you can like recognize voice and translate that you can create better conversational AI so it really opens up a new range of possibilities the same way the previous generation of Technology creates the ability for machines to calculate better or to retrieve information better with search engine there's a whole range of new use cases that weren't possible before that are now made possible by Machine learning uh the hype that we're seeing now is just to catch up on the previous wave of usage this is very different for example than crypto where you had a lot of pipe but very little usage I think it's quite sustainable and as we see more use cases more usage more companies investing on the topic in 2023 hopefully it's gonna going to become more and more for mainstream topic and more and more Central topic what we want is for everyone to understand AI understand what it can do what it can't do some of the challenges associated with it for example biases are a big challenge for AI systems today we want everyone to you know understand that so that they can you know help us mitigate some of the risk uh and and make sure it doesn't create more challenges so there are a number of issues that fall into different categories that still need to be resolved with this AI as uh flashy and exciting as some of this new technology is it's still prone to errors and mistakes AI practitioners call it like hallucination where you might ask open AI is a chat gbt a basic math problem and it will very confidently give you an answer but it turns out the answer is completely wrong that could you know in a business capacity hurt a business if they're kind of using inaccurate information taking it at face value beyond that there are kind of more deeper ethical concerns that have not been addressed one of them being the copyright and IP around this new AI the way that this generative AI is possible is these companies have trained their AI models on this massive massive quantities of data and a lot of that data is pulled from the internet you know so take an example like stable diffusion which is trained on millions and millions and millions of images around the internet stability AI which is one of the companies that we write about in in our coverage and is behind stable diffusion they've been sued recently by Getty Images which is alleging that they used millions of Getty's photos to allegedly train the models without paying Getty a dime for their work there's also a lawsuit going on against openai Microsoft and GitHub which is owned by Microsoft from programmers who believe that the code that you can get which is usable it's not perfect but it can actually save time for some programmers today but that code comes from programmers who similarly were not compensated for their work foreign [Music] the rate of change that I expect that we're going to be seeing over the next few years it makes me concerned that we are not going to be ready for what's coming next and yes we're better at the issues from 10 years ago but we still haven't even solved the problems that have been caused by the the old transformation where ranking systems sort of reshape our society right now there's two main sort of camps within the tech World in terms of how we're going to govern this technology and one is we're just gonna give everyone the power as an individual to do whatever they want with it and the other is that the tech companies themselves will decide what you can do and both of those don't seem really great like yes it's nice for us to have individual power but if everyone has the power to mess with democracy everyone has the power to harass others to extort others to generate scams quickly on demand like that maybe isn't really good for the world there's a question of what else is there right and then that is what democracy tries to do it's it's can we take that question of how this technology should impact society and bring it to a process where those decisions are being really considered in terms of their impacts but the challenge is that our current Democratic systems are frankly too slow and the AI advances are both incredibly quick and they're global one of the most terrifying and in many ways exciting applications of generative AI is to copy our voices that's incredibly useful for translating across languages so you can have you just speaking in any language and it really sounds like you but the downside there is someone can use that same technology to just copy your voice saying anything they want we had companies in the space that were really responsible as well as one couldn't be and they they had a lot of safeguards to make it so that you really it was really hard to copy someone's voice about their consent but that all changed very recently when a number of companies just came out without doing that it's sort of like you're lowering the bar for responsibility because these new entrants are coming in because it's cheaper to not build in that extra Tech and it makes it easier to use and so we can't live in a world where people keep undercutting those responsibility practices there is real risk that we are moving toward a world where people just don't have any sense of what is real and they just sort of give up on that and we've already seen that obviously in many parts of the world the sort of what I'm calling reality apathy that is not the ingredient that we need if we want to have functional Society functional democracy like Society is built on trust economics is built on on trust politics is built on trust and we get into a really dark place when we don't know what we can believe I think there it's very difficult to see where this AI will not impact anywhere that a human and a computer interface from better chat Bots to the whole of the media industry changing to create faster better output and even areas like education and Healthcare augmenting human potential in these areas it's hard keeping up to date with what giant Fai look likes next week let alone one year or five years but I think in the next few years we're going to see video we're going to see audio 3D the ability to really create any world you can imagine and I think that will be amazing I think we'll see it in areas like education and Healthcare and others really helping and enhancing our ability to Aid people and I think that's going to be great to see because it can integrate into existing systems unlike other things like maybe the metaverse or web 3 that always created their own systems and there was never really immediate value for a couple things that have shocked me about AI as I've gotten to know this space one is that I feel like we're not all as unique as we think we are these tools are pretty good at predicting what an email to reject a PR pitch looks like or right back at me you know the kind of way to send a PR pitch to someone like Alex the reporter that kind of communication is actually pretty well predicted and so I think that we're going to see these AI tools you know being useful there much earlier than I would have guessed Sam Walden declined to be photographed for our Forbes story we did photograph Greg Brockman and a couple other leading entrepreneurs in this space but for Sam we thought it would be really fitting to use his own tools to generate an image of himself so he put into a prompt in open ai's image generating tool called dolly that said Sam Alden on the cover of Forbes we got some weird ones back including a cover of sort of a blurry faced uncanny valley Sam almond-like person holding a cover of a magazine like Forbes with the same image of blurry Sam Altman we've already seen some media companies starting to explore how to use these AI tools themselves some elegantly some actually getting in trouble for publishing stories written by an AI tool and not disclosing it right away I think this is a debate that's going to happen across the media landscape for someone like me I'm actually not concerned I do believe that just like using an iPhone or a transcription tool or other pieces of technology in my job I'll be using AI to do my work better if the AI can replace my work then I don't think I'm doing a good job thank you I think her sense talking to these Founders these investors is that uh a lot of the coolest applications that are going to come out of this you know AI wave haven't even been invented yet maybe haven't even been imagined yet that said it seems like for the most part starting out where this AI is going to be applied is in some of the more boring places some of the more busy workplaces how do we integrate this AI into our basic business workflow so I think you're starting to see kind of consumer behaviors change students for example are already kind of using chat gbt to generate essays for them some artists are using models like stable diffusion mid-journey or open ai's Dolly to help them create works of art I think because machine learning is such a different Paradigm as a typical software there's going to be like a flock like a wave of AI ml native startups that are going to do things build products 100 times better than the inconvenience who have not been able to deal with machine learning the the same way so this is very exciting because I think we really have the opportunity to change the Paradigm completely and make a merge a whole group of newcomers uh and and new companies that are going to be able to do things differently what we can do is you can use sort of new forms of democratic processes and this is what what I've been calling sort of platform democracy or AI democracy to ask a sort of Representative selection of the global population like how should this technology be used how should it be deployed it sounds crazy to to say this but there already are pilots of of this sort of global process and the reason why you need it to be Global is because this technology affects everyone it creates legitimacy it makes it really really hard for companies to then be like oh we're democratizing this technology when really what they mean is we're giving everyone the ability to just like mess with everything that isn't what a democratic process that isn't what considered deliberation would have led to if you had the people who were being impacted by that technology in the room we need our AI systems to not just be optimizing for engagement as we've seen with things like Facebook and Tick Tock and YouTube but for the sort of the human values that actually support society and support democracy and a big part of that is sort of not optimizing for division which is what comes naturally out of those algorithms in many cases and so a lot of my work recently has been around how can we instead optimize for bridging divides making conflict productive as opposed to destructive so that I think that is absolutely core to bake in from the beginning because we've seen what happens to society when systems that billions of people are using every day are really optimizing for division and it isn't pretty in my opinion Ai and machine learning is becoming the new paradigm to build all technology in my opinion Ai and machine learning is becoming the new paradigm to build old technology

#chatgpt #openai #programming",1,[Music] in this tutorial you're going to learn all about what chat GPT is how it works and most importantly how you can use it to boost your productivity as a software developer as a seasoned developer and teacher let me tell you chat GPT is a game changer you don't want to miss out on don't take my word for it just watch this video and see for yourself [Music] my name is mosh hamadani and I'm super excited to be bringing you this tutorial on chat GPT I've helped millions of people learn to code and become professional software Engineers through this Channel and my online school codewithmash.com if you are new here make sure to subscribe so you never miss a video so what exactly is chat GPT and how does it work chat jpt is a Cutting Edge AI tool created by open AI it was released in November 2022 and gained 1 million users in just 5 days in comparison it took Netflix three and a half years and Instagram two and a half months to get the same number of users chat gbt is an advanced language model that can understand and generate text you can use it to create content for your website write articles emails tweets cover letters and so on you can also use it to generate code in a number of different programming languages like python JavaScript HTML CSS and much much more you can use it to generate dummy data write unit tests translate text or code from one language to another you can use it to explain code for example if there is a piece of code you don't understand you can ask it and it will explain to you like a patient teacher but I have to be honest sometimes it explains too much chat GPT can also help you learn and remember things faster for example you can give it some text and have it ask you a bunch of questions it can also prepare you for job interviews you can have it improve your resume write a cover letter for you and also interview you like an interviewer now do you think chat GPT is going to take your job let me know in the comments below the reality is whether you like it or not chat GPT is here to stay in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to use it to get more creative and get things done a lot faster I'll be showing you various examples for different programming languages both for beginners and experienced developers but before we dive into that let's take a moment and understand how chat gbt works chat GPT uses a type of artificial intelligence called a language model a language model is a type of software that is designed to understand and generate human language it does this by looking at a large amount of Text data and learning the patterns and rules of a language for example if the language model is trained on a lot of English texts it will learn about the grammar and structure of English as well as the meanings of words and how they are used in different contexts once the language model has learned about a language it can then be used to generate text in that language now chat GPT provides different language models for different purposes gpt3 models which are designed to understand and generate natural language like English and codecs which are specifically trained to understand and generate code these models are trained on billions of lines of code publicly available on GitHub they're mostly capable in Python but they're also pretty good in a bunch of other languages like HTML CSS says JavaScript typescript Ruby SQL and more now before we look at specific examples remember shot GPT like any tool has limitations it might sometimes generate incorrect harmful or biased information so don't take whatever it tells you as a silver bullet don't use it to learn to code because the code that is generated is not guaranteed to be right it might be functional but it might not be the best way to code so in a nutshell chatgpt is a powerful tool that can help you be more creative and efficient but it's not a substitute for human expertise and judgment so that's the theory part now let's move on and see chat GPT in action so head over to chat.openai.com if you don't have an account sign up it takes only a minute once you have logged in you're going to see the main screen with an input box to talk to chat GPT there is also a Chrome extension and a desktop application available if you don't want to use the web interface I'll put the links down below this video alright now let's get to the fun part going forward I'll be showing you various use cases for different programming languages we'll start off with some general purpose questions that apply to anyone regardless of the programming languages and tools they use you will see how you can use chat GPT to learn new things write shell scripts get commands start a business write legal documents and so on once we cover the basics then we'll dive into specific examples for front-end back-end and database development I will show you examples using HTML CSS JavaScript typescript python SQL and more now here's my first question what are the top three books for learning Java all right as you can see chat GPT has given us a very comprehensive and detailed answer now here we can ask more detailed questions for example we can ask questions about the first book so we can ask what are the key takeaways from head first Java all right another comprehensive answer you can see that this book teaches you about object-oriented programming Java fundamentals threading and concurrency GUI programming and so on now we can also ask more general questions like how do I become a front-end developer so now chat GPT is saying that to become a front-end developer you need to know the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript you should practice building websites then you should learn a front-end framework like react angular View and so on you should also know about Version Control Systems like git GitHub and Swap this is pretty much the same answer you will find on every website that gives you a roadmap to become a front-end developer now let's look at more specific examples we can ask chatgpt to write a shell command for us for example we can say write a bash command to find the name of all JPEG files in the directory and write them all to a text file take a look I love this answer so if you're not good with Linux commands you can easily find the final instruction you should use to solve that problem but what is beautiful about chatgpt is that it also explains how this command Works line by line piece by piece we can also have chat GPT red git commands for us for example we can ask how do I know how many lines of code I've committed to a git Repository we can also use chat GPT to get creative for example let's say you want to start a business you can have chat GPT generate app or website names for you for example we can say I want to make a revolutionary online shopping app give me some good app names so chatgpt is suggesting names like shop is Swift cart streamline and so on I think this list is pretty damn good now these are just some example prompt you don't need to use the exact same wording to talk to chat GPT you can ask any questions you want in your own way now if you have used this tool before let us know in the comments below the interesting questions you have asked so we can all learn and Inspire each other we can also ask chat GPT to write contracts for us here's an example I want to hire a graphic designer to design a website we have agreed that they will deliver the first draft in two weeks and offer three iterations free of charge any iteration after will be charged at fifty dollars an hour write a contract for us so the more details we give to chat GPT the better response we'll get all right take a look this is a pretty damn good contract to start with of course you don't want to take this as is and use it in the real world without first passing it by a real lawyer that's why earlier I told you that chat CPT is not a replacement for humans at least none at the moment it's just a way to increase your productivity and get things done in less time now if you're applying for a job there are a number of ways chat GPT can help you for example you can have it write a resume for you hear me can say I have three years of experience coding in HTML CSS and JavaScript write a resume for me of course we can give it more details we can explain our education level our past projects and so on but look at what we get with this simple prompt all right take a look so chat GPT created a basic layout that includes our name address phone number email some objective summary technical skills and it has already listed all the related web Technologies so we have HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery bootstrap we didn't mention any of this but it assumed that we have these skills it also included a section about professional experience including past projects as well as education certifications and so on again it's a great starting point now let's say you're applying for a front-end developer role you can ask chatgpt to write a cover letter for you that you can email to that company so we can say applying for a front and engineer role at some company write a cover letter for me all right take a look we have a comprehensive cover letter beautifully written in perfect English how good is that now let me show you another fun one you can have chat GPT ask you interview questions we can say act as a technical interviewer and ask me five questions about JavaScript take a look all right so here we have five questions that are often asked in technical interviews now let's say you don't know the answer to the first question you can ask a follow-up question so the beauty of chat GPT is that it remembers everything you have told it in this conversation thread so here we can say what is the answer to the first question again we get a very comprehensive detailed answer you can also ask chat GPT to help you write emails for example we can say write an email to my boss asking for a raise I've worked at this company for two years and successfully delivered several projects on time seriously if I wanted to write this myself it would take me 10 to 15 minutes if not longer I got the answer in just two seconds all right now let's look at a few examples involving code we'll start with using python for writing a command line tool we can say write a python function for generating a random password so as you can see we get a piece of code beautifully highlighted with explanation of how it works now if there's a part of this code that you don't understand you can always ask follow-up questions for example we can ask what this expression does in this code so we can ask what does 4 in I range of length 2 in this code take a look really really useful couldn't be better now we can also ask computer science questions like what is the time complexity of this function now if you're not familiar with this concept time complexity is a way to explain how large inputs impact the performance of an algorithm it's really beyond the scope of this tutorial I've covered it in detail in my data structures course in case you're interested so let's see what we get so chat GPT is saying that this function's time complexity is linear now let's take this to the next level we can ask chatgpt to write unit tests for this function so write unit tests for this function seriously how good is this if I wanted to write all this unit tests by hand it would take me probably 20 to 30 minutes if not longer of course we should always use our own judgment to make sure that the tests are correct but I think this code is a great starting point and it really saves us a lot of time we can also ask chat GPT for ideas to improve our code for example here on w3schools.com we have this piece of python code where we use a for Loop to iterate over a list of fruits if the fruit has a in it then we add it to a new list I'm going to copy this code and give it to chat GPT to see how we can improve this code so take a look how can I improve this code now here we should hold shift and then press enter so we go to the next line now we paste our code and then press enter to submit the question all right look a lot of details absolutely amazing one thing I love here is that chat apt is suggesting to use a list comprehension which is a one-liner for implementing the same logic of course there are more ways to improve this code we are not going to get into details here we can also ask chat jpt to convert our code from one language to another for example we can say convert this python code to JavaScript foreign just a few seconds our code was converted to JavaScript and down below we have all the details about how this code works we can also use chat CPT to generate dummy data for example we can say generate dummy data for a table called customers each customer should have an ID first name last name and City now in this case chat GPT gave us a python script for generating dummy data but what if we want the actual data not a python script we can say I don't need a python script just give me the data so now we get a list of 10 people represented using the Json format now we can take this to the next level and say create a python class for storing these objects foreign look we get an example of a python class called customer along with how we can use this class to store a bunch of customer objects inside the list absolutely beautiful now if you're a front-end developer you can ask chat jpt to generate some HTML markup for you and this is where examples get more and more interesting for example we can say write the HTML and CSS code for displaying a card foreign take a look we have the markup here we have a div with the class of card inside the div we have an image then we have the card content inside this div we have the card title and cart description really really good and right below that we have all the CSS we need to display a beautiful card of course we probably need to customize this but again this is a great starting point now we can stop here or we can customize this further for example we can say add a button below the card content foreign look what happened so now we have a new markup right under the card description we have a new div with the class of card action and inside this div we have a button beautiful now we also have more styles for this button we have the plane Styles as well as the styles for the hover effect now let's take this to the next level we can say when I hover my mouse over the card I want the card to slightly slide up so charge if it is suggesting that we should use the hover sudo class and the translate function Translate Y to slide the card up beautiful I love it it's also suggesting an alternative solution using box Shadow so it's pretty up to speed with CSS features now let me show you something really cool we can ask chat GPT to rewrite this code using Tailwind CSS if you're not familiar with Tailwind it's a CSS library that has gained a lot of popularity lately so here we can say can you rewrite this code using Tailwind CSS foreign there you go now we have the same markup but with the utilityclasses that come with Tailwind CSS so we don't have to create CSS classes anymore now here we can get more creative and see what other UI libraries are supported next we can bring some JavaScript to the mix and make this interactive so we can say when I click on the button send an HTTP request to slash API slash products foreign let's look at the generated code so chat GPT is suggesting to use the fetch API that is supported in pretty much most modern browsers but I personally don't like to use the fetch API so I'm going to customize this further and say instead of the fetch API use axis which is a library for sending HTTP requests now take a look all right now we have the instructions for installing axios using npm or yarn as well as a modified example using axis beautiful we can also ask chat GPT to help us with compile time or runtime errors here is an example let's say as part of writing some JavaScript code we got an error saying uncut type error cannot read property let's say bar of undefined anyone who has written a little bit of JavaScript code has probably come across this error so we can copy paste the error message here now chat GPT explains exactly what this error is and how we can potentially solve it so going forward I think a lot of people will start to use chat GPT instead of Google now we can also throw react here and make the example more interesting so we can say create a react component for displaying a card all right let's see what's happening here so up here we have an example of a function component for displaying a card now I personally don't like to have a parameter called props it would be nicer to destructure this parameter and grab individual properties like title description and so on so if you're not familiar with this concept don't worry just continue watching we're not going to do a lot of fancy JavaScript stuff in this video this is just to open your eyes to the possibilities so let's take this to the next level and say this structure the props parameter so the beautiful thing about chat GPT is that it remembers our conversations so let's go ahead foreign we have a new implementation of the card component with the props parameter destructured all right now let's move on and look at a few examples involving back-end development for example we can ask chat jpt to build an API for us with node and express so here we can say I need an API built with express.js to return the list of products each product should have attributes like ID title description price and image URL thank you all right look at this implementation in this implementation we have an area of products stored in memory and we have an API endpoint exposed at this URL I don't want to have an area of products in memory I want this product to be stored in a mongodb database so here we can say modify the code and retrieve the products from a mongodb or a MySQL or a postgres whatever database now we get a new implementation where products are retrieved from a mongodb database using the Mongoose Library here it is now in this implementation the type of these parameters is not clear because this code is just plain JavaScript now we can improve this implementation and use typescript so we can say use typescript in this code now we have a new implementation of the same web server implemented using typescript now let's say you're a python developer you don't want to use JavaScript so here we can say generate this API using Python and fast API which is another library for building apis using python so all right now we have a new implementation but in this implementation our products are stored in memory again we can talk to chat GPT and customize this further all right now let's look at a few examples involving databases this one is pretty interesting so I'm going to say write a SQL query to generate a table called products with four columns note that I'm not specifying the column names and types here I'm just saying I want a product table with four columns see what happens now look chat GPT is smart enough to know that quite often products have attributes like ID title description and price if this is not what you want you can always specify the name and type of each column for example we can say write a SQL query to generate a table called products with these columns now here we press shift and enter so we go to the next line and on each line we can list a column we can say ID of type integer title of type string category of type integer unit price of type float and image URL of type string and you don't necessarily have to put a type in parenthesis you can type a colon and right after that we can specify the type so chat GPT doesn't have a particular syntax you have to follow because it can understand human language all right now in the products table we have columns like ID title category unit price and so on we can also use chat GPT to write queries for retrieving or updating data for example here we can say write a query to retrieve the top five customers in Manhattan note that we don't currently have a table called customers so we're just asking chatgpt to write a query to retrieve the top five customers in Manhattan take a look alright in this example chatgpt has assumed that we have a table called customers with these columns ID name address and City if our customers table has a different schema we need to specify that ahead of time so we specify the name and type of each column then we ask chat GPT to write a query to retrieve the top five customers now look at this query in this query we're simply selecting customers who are located in Manhattan so in this query the customers are sorted by their ID in descending order and the top five are returned this is not what we really want what we want is the top customers who have spent the most so we need to be more specific with our prompt so we need to tell chat CPT to do a join with the orders table to find out how much each customer has spent then it should grab the top 5 customers who have spent the most so we can say revise this query and join the customers table with the orders table to find out how much each customer has spent then pick the top five who have spent the most and again here we can specify the schema of the orders table as well so let's go ahead all right look now chat GPT is assuming that we have two tables customers with these columns and orders with these other columns and based on this schema it has revised our query to retrieve the top five customers who have spent the most so that's it guys there are endless ways to get creative and use chat GPT I hope you found this video helpful if you enjoyed it please give it a like And subscribe for more videos like this also let me know in the comment section what interesting questions you have asked chat GPT I would love to hear from you so thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video
a8ii0TvcfY0,Scunthorpe steel plant shuts coking ovens threatening up to 260 jobs,"British Steel has blamed high energy bills and the cost of decarbonising its business for its decision to shut its coking ovens in Scunthorpe, meaning the loss of up to 260 jobs.

But unions fear the decision could undermine the viability of the entire plant, where most of British Steel's 4,000 workers are based, and say they will oppose the move.

 -----------------------  
Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News",1,sign says British steel but the Chinese owner jinye is firmly in charge of the giant scunthorpe site in a statement this morning the company's chief executive Chi Feng Han confirmed plans to close the coking ovens here with the loss of 260 jobs with talks ongoing with the treasury over a support package worth hundreds of millions of pounds the decision to go ahead and cut jobs was condemned by the local MP and met with concern from workers well used to uncertainty according to unions have just been really Union statement uh there's still a bit of hope so we are we are open obviously for younger younger younger end as well probably just for um older and so I'm coming to what ending we're working life anyway we know what we're coming so it's a matter of time it can't be over so it'll devastate this town if we do lose it you're not what I mean but I don't think we will not not for a while can it keep going without the coke uh well yeah yeah to do electric art furnaces and uh get gas in we will be you know what I mean we'll be okay but it's up to the Chinese isn't it really I'm absolutely devastated obviously this is a lot of people's lives you know and obviously I've got kids obviously I work at a cold covers as well so obviously it's not it's not brilliant news is it British steel declined to give interviews today but the firm blamed exceptional energy costs and carbon pricing bills which jumped by over 190 million pounds last year it's said it's invested hundreds of millions of pounds in the works and claims the closure of the ovens will support its journey to Net Zero unions say it's a case of broken promises we don't see how there can be any more Cuts as I say we're already at low levels dangerous levels of money to go any lower we we think we we'd be putting lives at risk and at a time of trade tensions and diplomatic sensitivities unions say the government cannot afford to risk two of only four remaining British blast furnaces closing entirely the government has to step forward and make a decisive decision on whether the want to steal industry in this country or the dog wants a steel industry because then we have to impart all the coke that we need to run our processes so that basically that holds us to Ransom to other countries and then he had one of them should we get in a conflict any one of them can shut that Supply off over 1400 people work here supporting thousands of others in the supply chain and there are now fears more jobs could be at risk in the months to come the local conservative Council and MP say affected staff are being offered help residents here are determined a town forged on steel must have it at its heart in the future we're joining me now is Henry Morrison Who's chief executive of the northern Powerhouse partnership um Henry Museum just give us your assessment of the impact of what's happened today what might happen in the weeks to come on the the scunthorpe itself but also the region as a whole my concern is firstly with the workers affected and obviously whatever can be done to keep those jobs in whatever form is important I think in terms of The Wider economic impact you have to remember the many thousands of jobs that depend on the onward process so the supply chain but also those industries that rely on it for example at the local port in immingham so I am concerned about the wider trajectory of the The Wider steel works and we do have to make that transition to start as was said in the film to work towards electric art pharmacies because actually in the end blast furnaces are old technology as a country we're not transitioning fast enough to those more sustainable ways of producing the steel we need well I'll come back to that transition a minute but the business secretary said that it wasn't a given that the UK needed steel industry does she have a point that actually you need to invest in a whole Greener economy away from steel I think the problem is that we would be unique amongst industrialized nations to not have our own steel industry and is a sovereign capability whether it be for our defense work or for important parts of the transition to that zero sort of growing Industries like a nuclear we do need access to Steel what do you mean by Sovereign capability then well we need to be able to control the steel we make not just for commercial uses but also for many of our military projects so we're building nuclear submarines across in Barrow I think we'd have a lot of concern about not being able to produce our own steel for projects like that in particular right well you talked about these electric Arc furnaces and the kind of new technology and the government's looking at a support package for that 300 million pounds has been discussed but shouldn't the Chinese employer foot the bill given that they've already had what nearly a billion of public sport I think it is on existing businesses that own steel works in the UK to take responsibility to invest in their own future but it isn't unusual for governments to support businesses across Europe in the steel industry to make this transition to create the right conditions in the right environment and it is about the onward jobs and the growth that comes from that so my point is that it's not just about the steel Works itself it's about its place in an ecosystem and so we need a steel industry because otherwise we'll be importing steel maybe more dependent than we are now and still that we import from Europe even made by traditional processes like through through the kind of traditional types of work that we've got at scunthorpe it's twice as bad in carbon terms to bring steel from Europe much worse if you bring it from India or China so it would be completely sort of the wrong the wrong direction particularly when we're doing projects about getting us to Net Zero to rely on steel that hadn't been made in the UK it's the right thing to create jobs here as part of these transitions that we're making to Net Zero and jobs in the steel industry are a critical part of that so where does all this leave leveling up I think it leaves the government with some real questions to answer we should have made that transition already to towards Greener steel and to be able to create jobs in those Supply chains already and I think it's it's dependent on the new secretary of state or Grant chaps to really grab the bill by the horns clearly this is about the owners of this particular plug probably sending the government a message sending the treasury message that they are going to demand support from government if they're going to be prepared to make this a going concern I'm I'm afraid it's sad it's come to that because actually government needs to send a clear message whether it be to new entrance or to existing companies here in the UK but we are going to make this a place where you can make steel and I think the business secretary and others need to get on board with that messaging otherwise we're not going to be sending the clear message we need to to Global markets and to those businesses already here but we are open for business when it comes to keeping steel production here in the UK Henry Merson thank you very much for joining us

snow and rain to California and that lead forecaster at the weather prediction center of course forecasters across the country are watching this but we're happy to have Brian Hurley joining us this evening on this record-breaking we'll call it perhaps this winter weather Wallop Brian good afternoon to you so regarding these blizzard warnings I think that's the Talk of the Town we know we're going to get a lot of rain in California but just how rare is it I mean it's been about 33 years right in some areas since we've had these blizzard warnings but even down closer to San Diego though San Bernardino County mountains too under blizzard warnings good afternoon Steve and Marissa greetings to you all and I tell you you guys talked touched on how weird this winter has been 81 degrees here in the DC area broke a record at DTA that was lasted for 149 years so what a wild winter even here in the East but yes uh these blizzard warnings that were issued for the Los Angeles Santa Barbara Ventura counties and uh from the Los Angeles National Weather Service forecast office first time since 1989. so you really have to go back you know 34 years now to get an analog from this kind of event as far as the San Bernardino Mountains uh that blizzard warning issued by the San Diego National Weather Service Office that's the first time that weather office has issued a blizzard warning I mean just so it's incredible stuff yeah it is I've been actually texting I'm actually texting currently with one of my friends who lives in the LA area because she also wasn't aware at first what was about to happen and I just got a video she said ice is falling in L.A right I was like you guys you got sleep but it this is this is you know just not so typical especially when you're talking about the Golden State so yeah how many areas across California are going to be getting that weather that that they just don't typically see I mean even some areas that are going to be seeing snowfall at those lower elevations absolutely Eureka had some snow today uh there were some light accumulations even down the sea level you know we're expecting in Northern California near sea level uh maybe a trades well we already had a trace maybe as much as one to two inches near sea level but as you get into Central and Southern California even the cities like you said Los Angeles they may see some ice uh some little ice pellets mixing in but you really still have to get into the elevations uh not far though those Hills over 1500 feet maybe 2 000 feet when you start to get several inches of snow and some of those locations there's a lot of towns in California that are nestled between two and three thousand feet you've got for example you've got the Placerville Grass Grass Valley uh um Pollock Pines these areas are going to get several inches of snow maybe for areas over 3000 feet a couple you know maybe 12 inches or so those blizzards warnings those those elevations between four and six thousand feet we're looking at between one and three feet of snow and those Peaks above six thousand feet which would include uh big bear um you're looking at um three to five maybe locally seven feet of snow seven feet it's a lot of snow just with a couple of systems too right we have one that's working right now and then and Brian speaking about the blizzards of course it's winds those are a big component right but we also have the other factor and those are the cold temperatures so let's talk about both of them we have wind advisories we even have freeze warnings in some spots of California too because of these bitterly cold temperatures that's that's a concern too so the wind is going to be a big concern as far especially with the energy with the power grid right the trees and power lines yeah that's a great picture by the way because a lot of the snow is going to be heavy wet snow for a lot of areas so snow load is going to be a problem but I think the wind will help with that but the problem is the wind will also hurt because of it's a it's it's a hazard in in of itself so that's going to be a big concern you're looking at wins I think I wrote These down even at the past levels and that the lower elevations 30 to 50 mile an hour sustained winds you get higher up into the mountains it's 60 to 75 miles an hour so obviously travel is going to be highly discouraged if not impossible the thing about the snow when you bring it to the lower elevations you're going to get a lot of people like me who are going to be very curious who want to maybe drive up there um and that's that's going to be discouraged certainly within weather like this and as far as the cold yeah easily 10 to 20 degrees below normal for a lot of the areas record low temperatures certainly expected even Into The Valleys like you said with those Frost warnings or maybe or Frost advisories and freeze warnings record low minimum temperatures really today and tomorrow for a lot of those areas not the time to be going to California to warm up totally no not the case and it makes sense as those snow levels are going to be low also very cold Brian we know you'll be watching it appreciate Brian Hurley you joining us this evening here on Fox Weather lead forecaster at the National Weather Service the prediction center I guess enjoy that forecasting it's going to be a storm to remember thank you all right you guys have a good night I'm Amy Freeze welcome to Fox weather's YouTube page we have more great videos on the way so make sure to subscribe to stay updated on all

""fascism"" or ""fascist"" today, they're usually
using it in a derogatory way to refer to a group, a regime,
or even an individual that is overly aggressive, and
controlling, and totalitarian. But its roots, actually,
lie with Benito Mussolini, who was in power in Italy
during the 1920s, and 1930s, and through World War II. And they proudly call themselves
the Fascists and their ideology as fascism. And the root of
fascist and fascism come from the Italian
word ""fascio,"" which literally
refers to a bundle. It comes out of this idea
that a bundle of things will be stronger together
than individually. And this is actually
the symbol for fascism. And this symbol of this bundle,
this sheath of sticks, this actually predates Mussolini
by thousands of years. It goes back to Roman times. And even, based on some
of the things I've read, even predates Roman
times as a symbol of unity, a symbol
of official strength. And even before
Mussolini came around, the term was used by many,
many, many groups that viewed themselves as a
league of revolutionaries. A group of people somehow
fighting for change. And Mussolini was no different. When in the end of 1914
and then in early 1915, he establishes the Fasci
d'Azione Rivoluzionaria. And I'm, once again, so
sorry for my butchering of an Italian word. But this literally translates
to group action revolutionary, or you could say the
revolutionary action group, founded by
Mussolini in 1915. And it was really a splinter
of the Socialist Party. Well, there's an irony there
because Mussolini and fascism, in particular, is associated
with strongly anti-socialist ideology. But as Europe was entering
into World War I in 1914, some of the mainstream of
the Italian Socialist Party was against Italy
entering the war. They wanted Italy to
maintain their neutrality. But you had splinter groups,
more nationalist groups, that said, hey, look,
this is Italy's chance to claim its right. It should join the war on
the side of the Entente. And Mussolini was one
of these individuals. And because of his
strong pro-war stance, he was actually
kicked out of his-- he was head of a
socialist paper in 1914. And then he eventually, by 1915,
establishes the Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria. And by the end of World
War I, as we get into 1919, it regroups under the name
Fasci Italiani di Combattimento. So this literally translates
as, you could view Fasci as a group, or league,
or revolutionary league of Italians of Combatants. Or the Combatant Italian
Revolutionary Group-- I guess is one way
to think about it-- or the Group of
Italian Combatants, is another way to
think about it. And their ideology--
and their ideology wasn't well established
right when they set up. It was just really
around this idea of being super
pro-nationalist-- but it began to develop over the course
of the '20s and the 1930s. The core idea, and I've
already said it multiple times, is an extreme nationalism. And when we talk about extreme
nationalism, or nationalism in general, it's talking
about the interests of one nation, of one
group, above all others. About putting the state
above all other things. Oftentimes, fascism is
viewed as a right-wing group. But in its purest form, it's
neither left- or right-wing. At the left end of
the spectrum, you could imagine
communist or socialism. I'll write communism,
which you could view as an extreme
form of socialism. Communism. And at the extreme
right, you could imagine just
complete free-market. Complete, unfettered,
free-market. Ultra small government. And fascists and
extreme nationalists, they didn't view themselves
as either end of the spectrum. They kind of viewed
themselves as a separate way where everything
was subordinate. The economy itself was
subordinate to the state. Now with that said, they
tended to align themselves more with folks on the right. So even though they
weren't completely free-market
capitalists, they were staunchly anti-communist
and anti-socialist, which caused them to form
alliances a little bit more with the right. But from their point
of view, it wasn't one of these extreme
right-wing ideologies that the government should be
subordinate to the economy, that the government should
be as small as possible. It was much more that
the economy was there to serve national interests. Some of the other ideologies
that the fascists began to hold is this idea that force was a
legitimate part of politics. So force in politics. And you would see this when
Benito Mussolini's fascists, through the use of
the Black Shirts, which was their
paramilitary group, which allowed them to eventually
take political control and enforce political control. And we later see it with
other groups like the Nazis. Who are also tended to be
associated with fascism. And their storm troopers
and their storm battalions, their paramilitary forces,
that are used to, essentially, take political control. The other aspect of
them-- and, as you could imagine, when we're
talking about either Mussolini or the Nazis-- is that
they weren't really fans of democracy. Not only did they
think that everything should be subordinate
to the state, but that the state should
have absolute control. So it's not about democracy. It's about having a
strong leader at the top. A strong one party at the top. And in the case of Mussolini
it was the fascists. In the case of Hitler it
ends up being the Nazis. So totalitarian. Completely totalitarian. And then, they
also-- and these all gel together-- this idea of
aggressive foreign policy. And this aggressive
foreign policy is really rooted in this
belief of cultural superiority. And, if you take the
case of the Nazis, this belief in extreme
racial superiority, cultural superiority. And I'm making a
slight distinction there because in
Mussolini's eyes, he was actually
quite disparaging. Even though Hitler
looked to Mussolini as something of a role model
when Mussolini took power in 1922, it inspired
Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch. Mussolini did not
think much of Hitler through much of the 1920s
and even early 1930s. He thought Hitler's
ideas of racial purity were really an illusion. That there was no
racially pure race. He didn't really appreciate
Hitler calling the Italians a mongrel race. But Mussolini himself did
think that the Italians were culturally superior. And that would be
their justification for an aggressive
foreign policy. For them taking over
other territory in Europe and in Africa. And as we'll see,
because they shared so much in common
ideologically, the Nazis were, you could kind of
view as a more extreme form. And the fascists themselves
were quite extreme. But the Nazis were
a more extreme form of the same ideology. They will, even though in
the '20s and early '30s Mussolini is more
eager to align himself with some of the other
powers in Europe, in particular Great
Britain and France. As we go into the
second half of 1930s, Mussolini and Hitler
find themselves to be kindred spirits. They both want to be aggressive
in their foreign policy. They both want to
secure other territory. They both have
this idea that they need space for their
superior populations, to their culturally superior,
and in the case of the Nazis, racially superior populations
to grow and thrive. And so as we enter
into the second half of the 1930s and
World War II, you have Mussolini and
the fascists become close allies of
Hitler and the Nazis."

are just starting to learn about the
history of China in the first half
of the 20th century, it can be a little
bit confusing. So the goal of this video is
really to give you an overview, to give you a scaffold, of
the history of the first half of the 20th century in China. So as we go into
the early 1900s, you have the end of imperial
dynastic rule in China. This is a big deal. China has been ruled
by various dynasties for multiple thousands of years. But as you get into the
1900s, the dynastic rule, in particular the Qing Dynasty,
was getting weaker and weaker. It had suffered at the
hands of the Japanese during the first Sino-Japanese
War at the end of the 1800s. There was growing discontent
amongst the opposition that the dynasty,
that the emperors, were not modernizing
China enough. Remember, this is
the early 1900s. The rest of the world was
becoming a very, very modern place. China in the 1800s had suffered
at the hands of Western powers who were essentially exerting
their own imperial influence in China. Many people felt that this
was because China was not as modernized
economically, politically, technologically as
it needed to be. And so you fast-forward to 1911. You have what is known as
the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the overthrow
of the Qing dynasty. By 1912, a Republic of China
was established in Nanjing. So Nanjing right over here
was where it was established. Beijing was, of course, the
seat of dynastic rule in China. And the first
provisional president of the Republic of China was Dr.
Sun Yat-sen, right over here. And he actually did not
directly participate in this final
uprising that finally led to the overthrow
of the Qing dynasty. He was actually in Denver at
the time, Denver, Colorado. But he was a leading or one of
the leading figures in the run up to this uprising, one
of the leading figures who was providing
opposition and had tried multiple times to
overthrow the dynasty. Now along with Sun Yat-sen,
he was essentially in cahoots with Yuan Shikai, who was a
general in the old dynasty. And he has his own
fascinating history. And Sun Yat-sen struck
a deal with Yuan Shikai, who was very
politically ambitious. Yuan Shikai said, hey, if I
can get the emperor Puyi, who was the last emperor of China,
if I can get him to officially abdicate, I want to
become the president. So Sun Yat-sen agrees to this. So Yuan Shikai
becomes the president of the Republic of China. But that wasn't enough for him. He declares himself
emperor in 1915, which you could imagine did
not make many people happy because they were tired
of having emperors. And by 1916, he abdicates
and he passes away, actually. And this actually
begins a period of extremely fragmented
rule for China. Even under imperial rule,
the Chinese military was not one consolidated body. The military was controlled
by various warlords in various regions that all
had allegiance to the emperor. Once you have Yuan Shikai
abdicating and then dying in 1916, and even
prior to that, when he declared himself
emperor, people did not want to pledge
allegiance to Yuan Shikai. And so you had what is known
as the beginning of the Warlord Era in China. And this is a fragmented
period where you did not have any centralized leadership. This map over here shows
kind of the rough picture of what the Warlord
Era looked like. Each of these regions
were controlled by a different warlord
who was in charge of a different military. When this was going on
during the Warlord Era, especially as we go back
to the early '20s, in 1921 in particular, Sun
Yat-sen hasn't given up. He goes to the
south in Guangzhou and sets up, essentially,
a revolutionary government, essentially a desire
from there to try to consolidate power in
China again and reestablish the Republic of China. So he goes there. But unfortunately he passes
away in 1925 from cancer. And the hands or the power of
the movement that he started, which is now being referred
to as the Kuomintang-- Let me write that down. Essentially, the
power there passes on to Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek. And Chiang Kai-shek,
the reason why we say the power
essentially goes to him is because he was in
control of the major part of the military forces
of the Kuomintang. And this is essentially the
very nascent early stages of what would essentially
be the Chinese Civil War because in the period from
1921 until Sun Yat-sen's death, you actually had a
lot of collaboration between the Chinese
nationalists, the Kuomintang, and the Soviet Union, and
the Chinese Communist Party. They were trying to
collaborate in order to think about how
China would unify. But then once Sun Yat-sen dies
and the power of the Kuomintang essentially goes into the
hands of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, he starts
to consolidate power. And right from the
get-go, he doesn't antagonize the communists. But by 1927, he's
starting to consolidate, he's starting to merge
these various factions in the rest of China. So he's able to
consolidate power. But he also starts to
go after the communists. So Chiang Kai-shek,
by '27, also starts to go after the communists. And the communists
are saying, hey, we are the ones that really
represent the spirit of what Sun Yat-sen represented,
while the Kuomintang under the leadership of Chiang
Kai-shek said, no, no, no. We represent what Sun Yat-sen
represented when he first established the
Republic of China. And so in 1927, you have the
beginning of the Chinese Civil War. This is when the Kuomintang,
as part of its efforts to consolidate
power, not only tries to consolidate power
of the warlords, but also goes after
the Communist Party. Now while all of
this is happening, as we get into the early
1930s, Japan once again is trying to exert its
imperial, its military, might on the Chinese mainland. They had already
captured Formosa, which is now known
as Taiwan, and Korea during the first Sino-Japanese
War at the end of the 1800s. And then in 1931, the Japanese
start to encroach on Manchuria. And this would essentially
become a multi-year occupation and infiltration of
Japan into China. And this continues all
the way until 1937, when it becomes an
official all-out war between the Japanese
and the Chinese. And I have a map
here that shows kind of the maximum Japanese
control over this period. And so in east Asia between
the Chinese and the Japanese, World War II was really just
part of the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese had
already encroached on the mainland of China
well before World War II had officially begun. Now while all this
is happening, Japan is encroaching into Manchuria,
in 1934, you have to remember, the Kuomintang, the Nationalist
Party under Chiang Kai-shek is going after the communists. And in 1934, he almost
has them, or he does. The communists are
nearly defeated. They're surrounded by
the Nationalist Party. And this becomes what
is a fairly famous event in Chinese history, the
famous Long March, where the Chinese Communist
Party, their military, is marched through
extremely tough terrain all the way to the
northwest of China. So this right over here is
a map of the Long March. The Chinese Communist Party
seemed to be on the ropes here in 1934. And it was during
this Long March that Mao Zedong really started
to exert and show leadership. The leadership during
this Long March, during this retreat to
the northwest of China, is really what allowed Mao
Zedong to eventually take control of the Chinese
Communist Party. Now as we fast forward, we know
that the Sino-Japanese War-- you could view this as one
theater, eventually, of World War II-- eventually the
US goes in on the side of the Allies against
Japan after Pearl Harbor. And then in 1945,
you have the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
with atomic weapons, which essentially ends
the Pacific theater. It's defeat for Japan, and
Japan has lost World War II. And at this point,
full-scale civil war between the two parties
break out again. The Civil War started in 1927,
and then it kept continuing. But then once there was a common
enemy in Japan that was clearly aggressively trying to take
over more and more of China's people, resources, exert
its imperial influence, then you had the two parties
kind of go into a low-grade war and say, hey, we need
to fight these Japanese. But once World War
II ended in 1945, once the Japanese were
defeated, then you had full-scale
civil war break out again between the
Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. And this is probably one of the
biggest comebacks in history. This was the Chinese Communist
Party that in 1934 and 1935 looked like they
were on the ropes. They were forced into,
essentially, retreat. They were able to come back. And in 1949-- and
there's a lot of theories as to why they were
able to pull this off. That they were able to get
much more of the support from the rural population. They were more savvy about
getting support generally than the Kuomintang. But we could talk about
that in a future video. But by 1949, they
were able to defeat Chiang Kai-shek
and the Kuomintang, force the Kuomintang
to retreat to Taiwan, establish government in Taiwan. And ever since then, you
had the establishment by the Chinese
Communist Party in 1949 of the People's
Republic of China."
k7dTDjRnBqU,"Democracy, Authoritarian Capitalism, and China: Crash Course World History 230","In which John Green teaches you about the end of World History, and the end of the world as we know it, kind of. For the last hundred years or so, it seemed that one important ingredient for running an economically successful country was a western-style democratic government. All evidence pointed to the idea that capitalist representative democracies made for the best economic outcomes. It turns out that isn't the only way to succeed. In the last 40 years or so, authoritarian capitalism as it's practiced in places like China and Singapore has been working really, really well. John is going to look at these systems and talk about why they work, and he's even going to make a few predictions about the future. Also, thanks for watching this series. It has been amazingly fun to create, and we appreciate all of you.

Anthony ""Fishbot Engineer"" M.",1,"Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History and today in our final episode of this World History series we're going to return to some of our favorite themes, like the rise of the state; maybe the idea of ""The West""; and also we're going to speculate a little bit about the future. Mr. Green! Mr. Green! No, no, no...I-I thought you were from the future. Nope! I'm from your future, Me From the Past, so I know that NSYNC doesn't stay together, but I'm from my present. Although, now I'm from my past. No, present again. That's the problem with the future, me from the past. It keeps briefly becoming present and then becoming past. And then of course people watching the videos will be watching them in their present, which will be my ever more distant past. And they could be watching them in ten years, the things that I have predicted will have come true or not come true, and I will look like a genius or an idiot. Ahhh I'm freakin' out Stan! Just roll the intro. [Theme Music] Man, I'm glad that intro pulled me out of that logic loop. I could have been stuck in there forever, which reminds me that forever itself is a very weird concept. I think the only thing we can say about forever is that the future is forever. So Americans are pretty proud of their democratic government and its history, but in world historical terms, democracy has not been the norm. Like the 20th century was the high tide for democracy worldwide with the number of democratic governments increasing dramatically, but the 2000's so far have seen something of a anti-democratic renaissance with the number of democracies that shouldn't actually be called democracies, doubling between 2006 and 2009. Like the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, despite having democratic in the name, not particularly democratic... I'm sorry for saying that Kim Jong-un, but it's true... He's behind me, isn't he Stan? You'll be gone in 20 years, that's my first prediction. Also, while democracy can sound great, no countries have ever actually practiced pure democracy. Unless you count Ancient Athens which a) was not a country, it was a city state and b) it excluded women and slaves from the political process so it wasn't really a pure democracy. Because you know, like, most people didn't get to participate in the government. What we call democracies today are actually the result of a number of revolutions in political thought that happened mostly in the west between
the 17th and 20th centuries. Like, we've talked a lot about the first of these revolutions in political thought which happened in the 17th century with the creation of the centralized nation state in Europe. And then there was the political breakthrough put forth by John Stuart Mill, who envisioned a night watchmen state that was like too small to infringe on individuals' freedoms but efficient enough to be functional and useful as a government. Then in the late 19th and early 20th century, the west developed the idea of the modern welfare state, enshrining the belief that the state should provide things like education, health and unemployment insurance to enable citizens to lead fulfilling lives. The welfare state relies on government planning and bureaucrats who get their jobs not based on high birth but on merits and also data-driven answers
to problems. And so we saw the rise of technocrats and intellectuals influencing government policy. To quote the book called ""The Fourth Revolution,"" there were two things new about this welfare state. ""The taxation of the entire population to provide benefits for the unfortunate and the removal of the 'poor law' stigma from social welfare. The poor were now victims, not layabouts."" So, in contemporary Europe and the United States, everyone pays taxes, right. Whether it's consumption taxes or property taxes or
income taxes or whatever. And we don't view poverty merely as personal failing but as a problem that needs to be addressed. And although imperialism certainly made it problematic for these ideas to spread completely throughout the world, the ideas did prove very powerful, like India adopted a heavily top down welfare state based on British principles once it became independent. And even when the liberal democratic state came under ideological attack from fascists and communists, it was able to triumph by mustering the resources to win World War II and meet the Soviet Challenge during the Cold War. And for most of the 20th century, western democracies have been on the whole, pretty successful in providing peace and stability and prosperity to their own citizens. And yet, many parts of the world are turning away from these ideas now. Why? Well, one of the reasons democracy may be falling out of favor is that many of the most successful countries in the world, at least in terms of economic growth are not democratic. There are democracies experiencing tremendous economic growth like Brazil and India. But then of course there's China. And China along with countries like Singapore have looked to the west for guidance on how to create capitalism but they've been much less interested in adopting Western models of governance. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So Singapore might only have 5.2 million inhabitants but it has very effective government. The architect of its success, Lee Kuan Yew, has argued that cultural values are the explanation and that Asians are quote, ""More focused on the family, more devoted to education and saving; and more willing to put faith in a Mandarin elite than the West."" But it's probably more due to Singapore's being more authoritarian, more interventionist, and more bossy in following Lee's Hobbesian view that, ""Human beings, regrettable though it may be, are inherently vicious and have to be restrained from their viciousness."" Although Singapore isn't technically a one party state it's also very far from a traditional democracy. Like in 2011 Lee's People's Action Party won 60% of the vote and 93% of the seats in Congress. That may sound terrible but it has an upside. Knowing that their party will win elections allows Singapore's politicians to focus on something else. Namely long-term planning. If any of the particularly ""Asian"" traditions cited by Lee have fueled Singapore's success it's that Mandarin ideal of choosing and promoting skilled bureaucrats based on merit. The most interesting thing about Singapore's government is that, at least by Western standards, it's remarkably small, with like, for instance a world class education system that consumes only 3.3% of Gross Domestic Product. They also have a required retirement fund in which Singaporeans contribute 20% of their paycheck and their employers kick in another 15.5%. AND as you'll already know if you watch our show Healthcare Triage, Singapore has one of the most efficient and fascinating health care systems in the world. Thanks Thought Bubble. And then there's China with its gleaming skyscrapers, enormous number of billionaires, and what is now the second largest economy in the world. Now, of course, there's also the air pollution, the growing income disparity, the terrible working conditions, but hundreds of millions of people in China have emerged from poverty in the last 50 years. And this was all accomplished by a very repressive state, so repressive, in fact, that they can't see this video. The Chinese model of governance has often been called authoritarian capitalism and its architect was Deng Xiaoping. He was very impressed by Singapore and sought to copy them, and in many ways, the Chinese Communist party has been very successful at that. Despite some official corruption, the Chinese state is very efficient and has presided over an incredible economic and social transformation in the past 30 years. So we expect, like, rigid central planning from Communist parties, right? But in China, rather than setting goals for every facet of the economy, the party makes sure that it's represented in most big companies, private and state-owned. And the biggest companies owned by the government dominate strategic industries like energy and transportation and telecommunications. The Communist Party’s Organization Department appoints all senior corporate figures in China. And in general they‘ve done a good job of promoting good managers that help the companies to grow. And China certainly wants this model to go global, since its state owwned companies have funded 80% of China’s direct foreign investment in the last 30 years, which allows commerce to advance Chinese diplomacy, extending the nation’s so-called “soft power.” So who knows if this will actually work, but when Chinese state companies are able to build the new African Union headquarters in Ethiopia, for instance, it sends a powerful signal to African nations that this is a system where people can get things done. Meanwhile, in the United States and much of Europe... a little bit of a struggle to get things done. So Chinese state capitalism may sound like the wave of the future, or at least the wave of the present. But maybe not. It has some serious drawbacks. First, the close ties between business and politics opens the system up to massive corruption. Fortunately, here in the United States, we don’t have any ties between business and politics, so you won’t see any corruption here! But there are also other drawbacks to authoritarian capitalism, like state-run industries tend not to be responsive to investors, which limits private investment. And in the long-term, that may limit the money available to them to keep growing. Also, with a lot of these state-owned industries, it’s not actually clear that they’re productive or profitable because they rely so heavily on government subsidies. And finally state-owned industries don’t to a great job of encouraging the freedom of expression that fuels a lot of, like, cultural and intellectual industries like, for instance Hollywood. Which is more cultural than intellectual. The Fourth Revolution quotes one Chinese commenter as saying: “We have [kung-fu] and we have pandas, but we could not make a film like Kung-fu Panda.” Also, this kind of state-run industrial policy is very effective sometimes, but it’s not clear that it’s going to be effective all the time. Like it may work better for building roads and cell towers than for creating software, for instance. So it seems to work for less developed nations that need to build infrastructure and industry; it’s much less clear that it will be effective when they need to move over to being service economies. And what I find fascinating is that China
has created this new path to economic growth in part by looking to its ancient past to revitalize its government. Because they've created a new education-based meritocracy, which is a modern version of the Han examination system. It’s sort of like a state run version of Plato’s Republic, and polls indicate that most Chinese people are pretty comfortable with it. I mean, things ARE getting better in China. Like philanthropist Nicolas Berggruen argues that ""Chinese-style meritocracy is good at focusing on long-term problems and bringing in independent experts."" That said, China’s government isn’t always as meritocratic and effective as some might want to believe. I mean, the Chinese version of twitter is a litany of complaints about poor schools and dirty hospitals and inept local officials. And in the wake of the Sichuan earthquake, when many children died because of poorly built schools, there was widespread outrage over the government's inability to like, get things built well. All that noted, it’s important to be aware that China embodies a challenge to the idea that the West has all the answers in terms of economics and government. Particularly after the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese were the ones lecturing about government and fiscal policy and claiming that the American political system was rewarding  mediocrity over talent. And lots of Americans would agree with these Chinese critics. I mean, we can’t even get a long-term highway bill passed, let alone like, long-term planning for the overall economy. In a representative democracy, the best way to get elected is to make promises, usually for lower taxes or for more or bigger benefits. Or my favorite -- for both. Also, democratic governments are very susceptible to interest groups extracting benefits for themselves. Just as autocratic governments are very susceptible to, you know, autocrats extracting benefits for themselves. And the problems of democracy can be a bit of a vicious cycle. Like in the United States at least, we're incredibly dissatisfied with our government, especially Congress, and this is partly because we’ve come to expect so much from government that they constantly let us down. Also, for the last 35 years or so, because people are so dissatisfied with government, one of the main strategies for winning political office is to talk bad about the government and to say that government is the problem. But of course, if we have too much government, that’s a problem that can only be fixed… by the government. So where does this leave us? Well, maybe we have reached the end of “the rise of the west?” that began with the nation state. But it’s really hard to predict the future! Like when I was in high school I wouldn’t have predicted that so many people would be learning about history and science from YouTube videos, much less that China would become the world’s second largest economy. If you’d asked me if 500 million people would emerge from absolute poverty between the time I graduated from high school and the time I started hosting Crash Course World History, I would have been like, no way! But I wouldn’t have said that. I would have cursed in class because I was a surly, terrible student. But here are my predictions -- I think that China will continue to be a one party state, and a very successful one, as long as that combination of state and industry continues to provide a rising standard of living. But I don’t think it’s going to happen in the U.S. or Europe, even if it would lead to more efficiency. The major differences between these two models of governance is that unlike communism and western style capitalism, they aren’t in direct conflict. Like, they can coexist. And I think authoritarian capitalism and western style capitalism WILL coexist, but I also think that probably in that process Western style democracies will find that over time, they have money to do less. And I think we may have a lot to learn from countries like Singapore, especially as new technologies enable greater efficiencies in providing services, thereby making a lot of jobs obsolete. Possibly including mine. I mean, these days robots are writing some reasonably good short stories, and Stan now has enough tape of my voice that he could make an excellent artificial me. One of the reasons we focused so much in this world history series on the factors that go into making a nation state is that while lots of people think that nation states are about to go away, I don’t. Yes, corporations are becoming more powerful and multi-national, but in many ways China’s rise to power was the result of a nationalistic desire to amass wealth and power that has its roots going back at least to the 19th century, if not earlier. But I want to make two observations here at the end -- first, whatever you think will happen in the future, whatever you think is happening now, even what you think happened in the past, really depends on what information you choose to focus on. So this year we’ve tried to look at really big-picture history and approaches to the study of history and how we learn about it, because there are choices involved. For instance, we focused a lot on the rise of the nation state and trade, but we could have focused on the changing role of the family or the impact of technology on lifespan or changes and continuities in religious practice or any number of other things. The other thing I want to say about history and the future is that neither is actually determined. 30 years from now, of course we’ll know a lot about what happens in the next 30 years, but we’ll also be looking at the past differently from how we look at it now. And YOU are a part of that. The choices that you make over the course of your life will shape history both in the future AND in the past. In short, we ask you to think about history and how to study it because we are counting on you. But history encompasses a lot and there is more than one history of the world. I hope you've enjoyed some of the versions that we’ve presented. Thank you so much for watching. Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio and it’s made possible by our Patreon supporters, including Charlie Shread and Scott Delea who are our cosponsors of today’s video.

ONE YEAR ON, AFTER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES LOST, STRONG UKRAINIAN RESISTANCE, AND THE U.S.LED COALITION FUNNELING BILLIONS IN AID TO UKRAINE WHERE DOES THE WAR STAND? WENDY SHERMAN IS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE. AND SHE JOINS ME NOW. DEPUTY SECRETARY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ONE OF THE CHIEF CRITICISMS OF THE U.S. AND WESTERN RESPONSE TO THE WAR IN UKRAINE HAS BEEN TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. THEY RESISTED SENDING THINGS LIKE STINGERS AND TANKS OUT OF FEAR OF ESCALATION ONLY TO PROVIDE THEM LATER ON ANYWAY. WE KNOW PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IS REQUESTING THESE LONG-RANGE MISSILES. EVERY EXPERT WE HAVE SPOKEN TO SAYS THIS WOULD LET HIM HIT FURTHER AWAY RUSSIAN TARGETS, KEEPING UKRAINIANS SAFER. WHY IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HOLDING THIS REQUEST UP? >> IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON AND TALK WITH YOU AND TALK WITH YOUR VIEWERS. PRESIDENT BIDEN AT EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY HAS LISTENED VERY CLOSELY TO WHAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAS ASKED FOR. NO DOUBT, IF I WAS PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, I WOULD ASK FOR EVERYTHING I COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF BECAUSE THIS IS VERY EXISTENTIAL FOR UKRAINE. THESE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS. WE LOOK AT OUR OWN READINESS. WE LOOK AT OUR OWN STOCKPILES. WE LUCKED OUT WHAT THE BATTLEFIELD IS AND WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE AND AT EVERY POINT ALONG THE WAY, ONE HAS TO THINK ABOUT ESCALATION, NOT TAKING US TO A PLACE -- I DON'T THINK UKRAINE OR ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO BE. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE INCREDIBLY LIES AND STEADY DECISIONS. I THINK HIS TRIP TO KYIV, HIS SPEECH IN POLAND MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD, FOR THAT MATTER, 141 COUNTRIES STOOD WITH UKRAINE. >> ON THE FEAR OF ESCALATION THAT HAS BEEN THERE, AND ALL OF THESE WEAPONS SYSTEMS WERE PROVIDED ANYWAY SO WHAT IS THE RUSSIAN RESPONSE YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID AT THIS POINT? HAVE ALREADY BOMBED CIVILIAN TARGETS IN HOSPITALS AND SO ON. >> WITHOUT A DOUBT, WHEN VLADIMIR PUTIN WASN'T WINNING OR ISN'T WINNING ON THE BATTLEFIELD, HE'S DECIDED TO TRY TO FREEZE PEOPLE TO DEATH TO ADOPT CHILDREN AND TAKE THEM TO RUSSIA AND TRY TO REEDUCATE THEM AS RUSSIANS. HORRIFYING ACTS I THINK EVERYONE LISTENING IS JUST ASTOUNDED AT THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE. SO MANY ECHOES OF HISTORY THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY HORRIBLE. THE UNITED STATES HAS PROVIDED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS HELD BACK FROM TAKING THE MOST HORRIBLE STEPS THAT HE CAN TAKE EVEN BEYOND THE HORRIBLE STEPS HE'S ALREADY TAKEN. >> THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD ALSO BE INVADING OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL, BELIEVING THAT THEY BELONG TO SOME FANTASY OF WHAT A RUSSIAN EMPIRE SHOULD LOOK LIKE UNDER VLADIMIR PUTIN. THEY DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS OVER MANY YEARS. EVERY SINGLE KIND OF NUCLEAR WEAPON, EVEN IF IT IS ""LOW THRESHOLD"" IS A VERY, VERY GREAT RISK TO THE WORLD SECURITY. AMNA: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE RECENT WARNINGS TO CHINA AGAINST PROVIDING LEGAL AID TO RUSSIA THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM U.S. OFFICIALS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT CONSTITUTES LEGAL AID THAT CHINA IS -- LETHAL AID THAT CHINA IS CONSIDERING PROVIDING? WENDY: WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT IT MEANS DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE WEAPONS. TO RUSSIA. THEY HAVE TOLD THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA DIRECTLY THAT IF THEY DO PROVIDE LETHAL AGE TO RUSSIA THAT THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. THE PRC UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT MEANS. >> WOULD THAT BE AN ESCALATION THAT WARRANTS A STRONGER U.S. RESPONSE? >> IT CERTAINLY WILL IF THEY PROVIDE SUCH LEGAL AID. VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS BEEN AN AGGRESSOR NATION. UKRAINE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM HERE. THE PRC SHOULD BE STANDING WITH UKRAINE. WHICH IS TRYING TO UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLES OF THE U.N. CHARTER THAT XI JINPING SAYS IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM. AMNA: DEPUTY SECRETARY, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AS A NATION. WE HAVE NEW POLL NUMBERS THAT SHOWS NEARLY ONE THIRD OF AMERICANS THINK WE ARE PROVIDING TOO MUCH SUPPORT TO UKRAINE. THAT IS A STRONGER SENTIMENT AMONG REPUBLICANS, 47% OF WHOM THINK IT IS TOO MUCH. DOES IT MAKE IT HARDER TO CONTINUE TO FUND UKRAINE? WENDY: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE THIRD OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE SAID THEY THINK PERHAPS WE ARE GIVING TOO MUCH. NEARLY TWO THIRDS THINK WE SHOULD STAND WITH UKRAINE. I THINK THAT IS A PROFOUND STATEMENT ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SOLIDARITY WITH UKRAINE IN THIS. EVERYBODY WANTS THIS TO BE OVER. NO MORE SO THAN THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. WHO ARE BEING FROZEN OUT OF THEIR HOMES, DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY, CIVILIANS BEING KILLED BY IRANIAN DRONES THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN OR SOLD TO RUSSIA. AMNA: I WANT TO ASK ABOUT IRAN BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY HAS SAID THAT THEY DETECTED IRAN HAS ENRICHED URANIUM TO 84% PURITY THAT IS WEAPONS GRADE. WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD FOR THE U.S. TO ACT IN PLACE NEW SANCTIONS OR TAKE ANY OTHER KIND OF ACTION? WENDY: I HAVE NOT SEEN THE FINAL ASSESSMENT BY THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE DETAILS OF THE ASSESSMENT THAT I KNOW THEY ARE CURRENTLY MAKING AND THE BASIS OF IT IS. AND THEN I AM SURE THAT WE WILL HAVE CONSULTATIONS WITH EUROPE AND OTHERS. BEFORE DECIDING HOW TO PROCEED. IF INDEED THEY HAVE ENRICHED, AS A MATTER OF POLICY TO 84%, THAT IS EXTREMELY CONCERNING. AMNA: WOULD THAT TRIGGER ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS OR SOMETHING ELSE? WENDY: INDEED, WE WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHAT CONSEQUENCES ARE APPROPRIATE. AMNA: THAT IS DEPUTY SECRETARY WENDI SHERMAN JOINING US TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WENDY: THANK YOU. TAKE CARE."

sTWO3Ddebzs,US Testing Weapon Worth Millions to Destroy Drones,"The US Marine Corps employs an impressive anti-drone device known as the Drone Buster, a five-pound Ray gun-like device that can jam drones. The gun has a three-hour endurance and continuous jamming capability in radio frequency detection mode. Its effective range varies depending on the distance between the drone and the controller, but a typical range is about 300 percent of the distance between the drone and the controller. As a result, the Drone Buster is a cutting-edge handheld anti-drone solution for countering foreign drone surveillance or interference and protecting critical areas. Unlike traditional portable anti-drone jammers, which rely on humans visually searching for drones, this new small-sized counter-drone technology detects threats easily and is capable of using radio frequency energy to overpower the drone's control frequency, causing it to stop hovering or returning to its operator without the need for human intervention.

tactical methods of operating drone Busters with immersive Solutions using virtual reality to train soldiers has proven to be an efficient way of providing the crew with the ability to experience real-life scenarios right in the training center this expensive anti-drone testing is worth every dollar spent on keeping the airspace safe aside from handheld Counter UAV devices there are numerous devices held in a stationary configuration they can be mounted on a vehicle or fixed on site these Technologies combined with capabilities of a single end-to-end Solution by employing a radar and multi-sensory system to detect multiple threats from afar in all weather conditions one of these Technologies employs an electro-optical sensor to lock on the detected Target while a video motion detector tracks it using machine learning technology and a large library of drone flight paths the system can assist in classifying the object they are simple to use and a single operator can interact with multiple sensors while correlating real-time data from various distributed sensors to provide complete situational Awareness on a map some of these Technologies are managed by a central Hub which allows for real-time monitoring and adjustments as needed the high energy laser system is also an effective weapon against surveillance drones the combat laser weapon combines a series of smaller individual lasers broken down into their component wavelengths into one massively powerful beam of drone blasting light in most cases these laser weapons result in the physical thermal destruction of targets during contact or simply neutralizing their threats rather than burning them off the Marine Corps laser weapon system which can be mounted on a vehicle has a beam length of more than 30 kilowatts these Technologies rely on a large number of modular fiber lasers they're easily scalable to different levels of power allowing the laser weapon system to have an infinite amount of Firepower so lasers are excellent choices because they are difficult for the enemy to detect hit the target quickly at the speed of light and have been shown to have a low cost per shot when compared to Conventional Weapons despite the fact that the Marine Corps employs anti-drone Technologies they also use drones to make their mission more convenient the main crew consists of the sensor operator

3V07UjhGAkI,How Strong are the Puma Infantry Fighting Vehicle,"The Puma Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle (AIFV) is a tracked vehicle produced for the German Army by Projekt System & Management (PSM), a joint venture of Rheinmetall Landsysteme and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), under a program authorized by the German Federal Parliament in 2002. It has been in service with German Army since 2015. However, as of August 2021, 350 units of the vehicle had been delivered in total. Previously, the Puma program was known as the Igel and the Neuer Schuetzenpanzer (NsPz).

The Puma was developed as a fully tracked transport vehicle that offers highly modern protection components and high firepower, making it one of the most advanced and most protected IFVs on the market. Puma was designed with three levels of protection to meet the operational needs. The vehicle weight varies, including 29.4 tons, 31.45 tons, and 43 tons. There are other IFVs that are heavier and possibly more protected than the Puma such as the German Lynx KF-41 and the Russian Armata heavy IFV. However, both of these IFVs are still in development and have received no production orders, whereas the Puma is a fully operational vehicle that has been built in large numbers.

most protected tracked Vehicles currently available Puma infantry fighting vehicle welded with armor Hull equipped with modular armor add-ons Puma has three different levels of protection to meet operational needs so how did the Puma become so powerful while also being highly protected if you're curious about the answer don't go anywhere and stay tuned [Music] foreign armored infantry fighting vehicle is a tracked vehicle produced for the German Army by project system and management a joint venture of rain metal land system and cross Mafi Wegman under a program authorized by the German Federal parliament in 2002 it has been in service with German Army since 2015. however as of August 2021 350 units of the vehicle had been delivered in total previously the Puma program was known as The Angel and the newer shuits and Panzer Puma was developed as a fully tracked transport vehicle that offers highly moderate protection components and high Firepower making it one of the most advanced and most protected infantry fighting vehicles on the market Puma was designed with three levels of protection to meet the operational needs the vehicle weight varies including 29.4 tons 31.45 tons and 43 tons there are other infantry fighting vehicles that are heavier and possibly more protected than the Puma such as the German lynx kf-41 and the Russian Armada heavy infantry fighting vehicle however both of these infantry fighting vehicles are still in development and have received no production orders whereas the Puma is a fully operational vehicle that has been built in large numbers [Music] with a length of 7.33 meters width of 3.43 meters and height of 3 meters Puma has a newly designed Hull not a modification of an older system its chassis development and design were undertaken by rainmetal an increase to the significantly more extensive protection level C or combat is carried out in the area of operation using easily attachable additional equipment and additional protection these armored modules are attached to the vehicle's flanks and hinged ensuring rail loading capability even with maximum level seat protection these protection modules are capable of protecting the crew against handheld anti-tank weapons 14.5 millimeter as well as 30 millimeter machine guns and other threats besides that mine protection of puma is extremely effective against both blast and projectile mines it appears that the most protected variant of the Puma can withstand 120 and 125 millimeter projectiles over the front Arc while the mine blasts it is resistant to his equivalent to 10 kilograms of TNT it is also important to note that through the simple disassembly of the flank protection modules on the Puma the weight of the military Airbus a400m is reduced to 31.45 tons [Music] on the other hand the Puma ifv also has a sophisticated threat warning system for self-protection and survivability in August 2006 Eads defense Electronics was awarded a contract for the multifunctional self-protection system or must for the Puma Vehicles the Moss is made up of three major components ultraviolet sensors which include a laser Warner and a missile Warner that incoming projectiles a computer and electronic or pyro Technic countermeasures it can handle four threats at once and operates in 360 Degrees Azimuth and 70 degrees elevation besides that the Puma is outfitted with two octronic image displays four rear-mounted cameras and one reversing camera two Vision blocks and one road remounted one image intensifier and an open hatch view sliding hatch and partially opened rear ramp a fire suppression system is also installed in the crew compartment while a fire extinguishing system is installed in the engine compartment additionally the Puma ape has a combined nuclear biological and chemical protection system air conditioning night vision and Main ointment stabilization as standard this infantry fighting vehicle has a three-man crew consisting of Commander Gunner and drive her along with up to eight equipped troops in the rear troop compartment passengers enter and exit the vehicle via a power operated ramp in the back the Puma vehicle is powered by MTU new high power density 892 series diesel engine or also called a V10 MTU mt892 ka-501 turbocharged diesel engine it also generates 1019 horsepower therefore this Puma engine is more powerful than the engines in some major battle tanks for example the original t-72 tank had a 720 horsepower engine whereas the current Russian t90a main battle tank has a 1000 HP engine thus the Puma can reach a speed of 43.5 miles per hour at an effective range of 404 miles moreover each side's suspension consists of five dual rubber tired road wheels with the dry sprocket and idler at the front armor plates protect the upper part of the suspension [Music] in terms of Weaponry the Puma is outfitted with a remotely controlled Weapon Station built by cross Mafia Wegman it is mainly armed with one dual feet 30 millimeter Mk 30 Cannon this cannon is mounted on Austrian Ulen and Spanish Bizarro infantry fighting vehicles and has a fire rate of 700 rounds per minute at an effective range of

be a game changer for battlefields in the future the kf-51 panther on the other hand taking place on the 12th of October in 2022 during the ausa exhibition in Washington D.C General Dynamics land systems or glds also revealed its new generation of main battle tank with greater Firepower protection and Mobility to confront all new threats in the modern combat zone the Abrams X both mbts are the latest members in their own tracked vehicle family and in this video we'll discuss the comparison between the k-51 Panther and the Abrams X the k-51 panther Pioneers a completely new MBT concept that was developed from the ground up utilizing the most current technology setting new standards in lethality protection networking reconnaissance and Mobility similarly the Abrams X is designed as a concept of the latest generation MBT of the Abrams rather than the extension of the Abrams tank family the k-51 is armed with a rein-metal future gun system fgs and optimized sensor-to-shooter links this fgs is equipped with a 130 millimeter smoothbore gun and a fully automated ammunition handling system delivering Superior Firepower against all current and future mechanized targets the fgs on the kf-51 can fire kinetic energy rounds programmable air burst ammunition as well as corresponding practice rounds Furthermore with additional Armament choices such as the 12.7 millimeter coaxial machine gun and hero 120 loitering munition the panther offers precise Firepower for long range strikes and against numerous targets in contrast the Abrams xmbt is outfitted with a new xm360 120 millimeter cannon as its primary weapon however the xm360 like the smoothbore gun on the kf-51 was designed as fgs it can fire new mid-range Munitions Advanced multi-purpose explosives and advanced knowledge explosives or Advanced kinetic energy the Canon incorporates a Pepper Pot style muzzle break at the muzzle to help reduce recoil while the entire gun system uses composite materials and titanium to reduce gun system weight and total vehicle weight besides that the Abrams X is also fitted with a coaxial machine gun and at the top of the turret an xm914 30 millimeter chain gun is installed the xm914 is outfitted with a remotely controlled gun system that allows the crew to fire from within the hull while using a thermal imaging system to aim at night and through smoke the Abrams X includes a redesigned armor package on the hull and turret for excellent protection it also has an active protection system APS that can intercept anti-tank guided missiles and other modern contemporary projectiles by deploying and triggering a small Warhead at a safe distance from the shielded platform to defeat the dangers using a Shockwave effect in terms of protection the kf-51 panther has an incredible integrated survivability concept it features on and off platform sensors combined with active reactive and passive protection as well as a dedicated top attack protection system or taps the Taps deflects attacks from above while the rosy smoke obscurion devices keep the kf-51 from enemy sight in addition to the Panthers digital NATO generic vehicle architecture ngva allow it to develop extra sensors for detecting launch signatures and can be operated in a contested electromagnetic environment talking about reconnaissance and situational awareness the kf-51 is equipped with a panoramic seo-s-s Optical sensor and EMES main combat aiming device allowing the crew to observe and engage targets independently day and night using a stabilized daylight and infrared optic with integrated laser range finder a monitor in the combat compartment also provides the crew with a 360 round-the-clock view of the vehicle's surroundings integrated unmanned aerial reconnaissance systems adds the crew's situational awareness and crowded locations and near to the vehicle with this the crew can perform reconnaissance while wearing armor and exchange the results with other vehicles and weapon systems over a network on the contrary the Abrams X's most remarkable capability is its aperture camera systems or dos on the turret it has several armored Electro Optical on the Tank's Hull providing the crew with 360 degree sight for a significant gain of situational awareness the Abrams X also has radar sensors which are pointed upward towards the rear of the tank this makes Abrams X capable of detecting and neutralizing the threats from Top attack weapons moreover the advanced silent watch a novel feature on the Abrams X allows the tank to use its power hungry thermal sights without having to switch on the loud and thermally visible gas turbine engine thanks to the Tank's new Hybrid engine the Abrams X is powered by dl570p3 tracks which were specially designed for the Abrams diesel model and our development of the 570 po the new Hybrid Power track on Abrams X features a bigger battery pack which significantly improves fuel efficiency the new hybrid powertrain can decrease the vehicle's weight as well as fuel consumption by 50 percent while increasing and motorizing the sensors for extended periods of time as a result not only does the hybrid electric Drive complement better watch capabilities and some silent mobility of the Abrams ax but it also supports the US Army's climate and electrification initiatives in comparison the kf-51 panther Builds on the leopard 2's Mobility concept it has a maximum operating range of roughly 500 kilometers and a weight of only 59 tons making it significantly more mobile than the existing systems this puts the tank in a battle-winning weight category and it also fits the tunnel profile amovp4l without preparation something no other recent MBT upgrade can achieve as a result the panther excels in tactical as well as strategic Mobility however the Abrams is also as tactical as the kf-51 as the Next Generation MBT but with lower weight and increased mobility and transportability it is said to be lighter than the 55-ton Abrams m1a2 and its family therefore the Abrams X is believed to be the most mobile tank in the world the panther offers a revolutionary operational Concept in terms of controllability and networking by sitting three-person crew in the turret the commander Gunner and driver with an extra operator station whereas the Abrams X has three crew hatches at the front of the vehicle the Abram Zach's turret has been refurbished to have a reduced profile and is completely uncrewed it also uses automatic load the redesigned crew configuration allows all three crew members to sit side by side rather than at separate stations with the Gunner and Commander having panoramic sights while the Abrams X already has an unmanned turret the kf-51 panther is still planning it for a future variant with a totally remote controlled vehicle turret or perhaps capability for human machine teaming in conclusion both kf-51 Panther and Abrams X represent a new generation of combat vehicles behind Metal's kf-51 was designed to do more than just to upgrade the existing MBT Concepts the platform was completely rebuilt from the ground up future Innovation will soon enable this tank to operate for better autonomation and combat Effectiveness optimization the Abrams X on the other hand is more than simply a tank for the 21st century features like top attack active protection and a 30 millimeter chain gun are inspired by the crisis in Ukraine the Abrams ax with its reduced crew and autonomous capabilities can be a critical component in Lethal combat Networks so which tank do you believe will dominate in future battles well you decide that's all for today thanks for watching
6tjx0escmHg,M270 MLRS: The Incredible Rocket Launch System That Continues to See Combat,"In today’s episode, we are going to take a look at a highly mobile rocket artillery system the M270. Manufactured by the United States’ Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, the multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) M270 is a self-propelled, armoured, multiple rocket launcher formerly known as the General Support Rocket System (GSRS). It is proven in battlefield and known for its high mobility. The MLRS has been operational with several armed forces around the world, including Bahrain, Finland, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Turkey, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the US as well as the UK. The system is also reportedly built in Europe by a global consortium of companies from the likes of Germany, Italy, France and the UK.

rocket system mlrs m270 is a self-propelled armored multiple rocket launcher formerly known as the general support rocket system gsrs it is proven in Battlefield and known for its high Mobility the mlrs has been operational with several Armed Forces around the world including Bahrain Finland Egypt France Germany Greece Israel Italy South Korea turkey Japan Saudi Arabia and the U.S as well as the UK the system is also reportedly built in Europe by a global Consortium of companies from the likes of Germany Italy France and the UK in order to supply a large volume of Firepower in a relatively short span of time and also against the time-sensitive targets mlrs has been designed to support Canon weapons fielded by the U.S army Division and core Commander all free flight basic and extended range Rockets as well as the Army tactical missile system atacum's block 1 missiles can be supported and delivered by the mlrs the system is capable of employing the shoot and Scoot principle to restrict vulnerability against counter battery fire not only does it boast the M77 Dual Purpose submunition with 644 high explosive grenades for anti-personnel and light vehicle standoffs the m270 can also hand over the West german-developed at2 shatterable mine Warhead and own the potential for dispatching other Warheads let's now see how the m270 mlrs were made throughout history in terms of Rocket artillery the Soviet Union held a distinct advantage over U.S and NATO forces in the early 1970s the bm-21 and other Soviet truck mounted multiple rocket launchers mrls would flood a Target area with thousands of missiles assuring that some would hit specific targets while also having a psychological effect in contrast U.S artillerists preferred Canon artillery over Area fire Rockets because of its relative accuracy and ammo conservation and as a result only a tiny amount of World War II era rocket artillery remained following the 1973 Yom Kippur War due to high loss rates particularly from rear area Weaponry like surface-to-air missiles this thinking began to shift in March 1974 the U.S army issued a need for a new rocket launcher known as the general support rocket system based on the awareness that such an incident might occur on a bigger scale in the case of a conflict in Europe it would be deployed to fight enemy air defenses and give counter battery fire freeing up artillery units to provide close ground assistance NATO Partners such as the United Kingdom France and West Germany were consulted on the project and because they had already been planning to build a comparable system on their own the term General support rocket system gsrs was changed to multiple launch rocket system mlrs Boeing and Vaught Aerospace began development in September 1977 and the first production versions were delivered in August 1982. in March 1983 the first operational m270 battery was created and the first unit was transported to West Germany in September of that year a battery originally comprised of three platoons each with three launchers for a total of nine launchers per battery by 1987 there were 25 mlrs batteries in service in the 1990s a battery was reduced to six launchers now let's move to the design of the m270 mlrs the unit of mlrs launcher contains the m270 launcher loaded with 12 Rockets packed in two six rocket pods the launcher which is a highly automated self-loading and self-aiming system Hoards the computised Fire Control that unify the vehicle and Rocket launching operations without the need to go out from the cab the crew of the driver Gunner and section chief can launch fire up to 12 mlrs rockets in less than a minute the mlrs computerized Fire Control System enables the launcher to be loaded and unloaded by a small crew or even a single soldier the fire control computer also enables either manual or automatic execution of firing missions meanwhile the Rockets can be launched individually or in groups of 2 to 12. because the computer re-aims the launcher between rounds accuracy is maintained in all firing modes for its Mobility the m270 mlrs is easily transportable to the area of operations for example by C5 transporter aircraft or train the mlrs has excellent cross-country mobility and a top speed of 64 kilometers per hour the basic mlrs tactical rocket Warhead contains 644 M77 Munitions that are launched above the Target in midair during Free Fall the Dual Purpose bomblets are armed and a simple drag ribbon orients the bomblets for impact had ranges of more than 32 kilometers each mlrs launcher can deliver nearly 8 000 Munitions in less than 60 Seconds what about the operational history of m270 the sixth battalion 27th field artillery deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield on September 2nd 1990. the unit was assigned to the 18th Airborne Corps artillery and played an important role in Saudi Arabia's early defense the Battalion was the first U.S field artillery unit to fire into Iraq as Desert Shield became Desert Storm throughout the war the sixth Battalion 27 field artillery provided both U.S core with timely and accurate rocket and missile fires either in the theater or also for other division of the army in August 1990 the 92nd field artillery battery mlrs was deployed to the Gulf War in support of Operation Desert Shield and a month later in September 1990 the a-21st field artillery mlrs first Cavalry division artillery deployed in support of Operation Desert Shield in 2003 the mlrs was deployed in support of operation Iraqi Freedom since then the mlrs has been used in a number of military operations the British Ministry of Defense decided in March 2007 to send a troop of mlrs to support ongoing operations in Afghanistan's Southern province of helmond using newly developed guided munitions in February 2011 the U.S army fielded the upgraded m270a1 launchers and the new Army tactical missile system atacum's quick reaction unitary missile after placing a 22.1 million dollar order for m270 launcher upgrade kits that's all for today thank you for watching and see you in the next episode [Applause] [Music]
4YPFGRkI4XQ,Rare look at China's artificial island-building project,"The U.S. says China is reclaiming land in the South China Sea. Artificial islands under construction could become military bases. China denied CBS News access, but Seth Doane got as close as any Westerner might.",1,we continue our look this morning on what China does not want you to see the United States says the superpower is reclaiming land in the South China Sea artificial islands under construction could become military bases China has not granted CBS News access but Seth Doane got as close as any Westerner might and he is in back in Beijing this morning Seth good morning good morning those territorial claims can be so scattered they almost appear like a game of Chinese checkers with different countries claiming different bits of land China will not let foreign journalists visit those Islands in the South China Sea so we traveled to the Philippines to try to find our own way to see that the patchwork of territorial claims may be best understood from the air a wreath belonging to China is close to an atoll claimed by Vietnam and not far from a shoal belonging to the Philippines we landed on PAGASA claimed by China inhabited by Filipinos and just 13 miles from subi reef one of the islands the Chinese have been creating okay so just hop in here there we hired some Filipino fishermen to take us as close as we could get thank you very much thank you one of the reasons the South China Sea is so valuable is that it has seven billion barrels of proven oil reserves that's the oil consumption of the entire United States for a year there are also the fisheries that provide these men with a living and busy shipping lanes that see five times more oil tanker traffic than the Panama Canal as we were first approaching subi reef here you could just see one crane now as we get closer you can see a number of cranes up and down the length of this island satellite images from early June reveal the pace of growth the landfill has expanded dramatically overall China is adding to its islands at the rate of at least three and a half acres a day it almost looks like a city in the middle of the sea there's enough space for an airstrip through the haze we could see the faint outline of heavy equipment and then a warning signal they've now flashed several warning signals at us our captain is starting to get nervous he tells us it's time to get out of here in calmer water our captain ramu lobar koma told us he felt it was too dangerous to get closer worried about being detained by the Chinese what was that signal that you saw why did you tell us we needed to turn back right away there's a nice pickle it was a warning for us not to go any further he said so I turned the engine down so we didn't look like we were moving closer gradually Suzuki back in Beijing we went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask why our requests to see China's Island building have not been granted do you believe it's a possibility that we could visit these islands but is China hiding anything on these islands so far no one has been able to visit well without their needs have on the yard I can tell you for sure spokeswoman hua chunying said that the Chinese government has nothing to hide from the international community it was hard to see that warning light on the camera but through the haze we made it out sought at least five times flashing there this week China said it had stopped expanding some of the islands in the South China Sea but Charlie it would not stop building on that Seth thank you so much good reporting very good I think I would have stopped there too oh yeah when the captain says the Connie said far enough yeah I think about the implications of China building those acre those islands there three lot very significance the military significance yeah this is a big story

#60MinutesAustralia",1,"there's trouble in paradise nations in the South Pacific are sick of us simply thinking of them as sunny playgrounds for postcard holidays many have significant problems which threaten their very existence in the last few months Scott Morrison has been trying to convince leaders around the Pacific that Australia is looking out for them and wants to help but the Prime Minister isn't receiving much thanks in return and that's because China is on the march and seems prepared to splash more of its cash in the region how it's doing that though as we discovered is alarming at times sinister right now in the Pacific seeing red has a lot of people seeing red two months ago the Pacific nation of Carabas switched its allegiance from Taiwan to communist China so this is very clearly somebody talen ism we're not being paranoid now as the first foreign journalists to try to report his sense we're under surveillance then house arrest three and a half thousand kilometres west in the Solomon Islands a glimpse of how China might by its alliances in the Pacific so they rang you and said we've got a million dollars for you if you come to the hotel and accept the switch to China yes and just to the north in war-torn Bougainville with its legendary gold mine we reveal a Chinese master plan you would be quite happy to do business with China oh yes how do you describe China's actions in the Pacific one word expansionist captain Jim Finnell was the intelligence chief of the US Navy's Pacific Fleet watching China's moves there on a daily basis now he's warning Pacific nations swaying to China's influence to be where China has told all these Pacific countries that it just wants to be their partner who wants to be involved economically do you not believe them well we have evidence that shows that when they say they want to be your economic partner the end result is they become your economic master China demands no country in its diplomatic sphere can recognize Taiwan and there's no doubt the communist superpower has a grand strategic plan in the Pacific extending its alliances further and further south and with those alliances massive infrastructure like this gigantic Wharf in Vanuatu that the country doesn't need but could dock an aircraft carrier with recent back-to-back recognition of China by the Solomon Islands and Carabas and possibly the soon to be independent Bougainville we asked Jim Finnell to join us on a Pacific mission to report on China's intentions they're interested in this area because it's essentially the lifeline or the the choke point between America and Australia and New Zealand China has built the Navy that people said they were never going to build China has deployed their fleet to places they said they were never going to deploy they believe that they're supposed to be the the rightful leaders of this new global order you know the British century the American Century now we're going to have the Chinese century that's their vision in September Menace Isayev are a prime minister of the Solomon Islands announced his country was ditching recognition of Taiwan chosen to be on the right side of history the Communist China a move deputy opposition leader Peter Ken alehrer says was more a dash for cash than considered diplomacy are you happy that your country has switched allegiances from a democracy to a communist state for me personally I'm not we should have taken our time and not be dictated and marching to the beats of a more dominant country is really China first not Solomon's first and here in the Solomons we found direct evidence the China's influence could have a sinister side so they rang you and said we've got a million dollars for you if you come to the hotel and accept the switch to China yes Daniel Sudan II is the premier of the Solomons largest island Malita he says he was offered a million dollar bribe to back his country switch to China you're suggesting that there are a lot of corrupt politicians in your government yes [Music] but a million dollars just to be pro-chinese I mean that's a hell of a way to do business oh it is it is a new way of doing things it's really dangerous you think there's one bag of money it's got to be more oh yeah yeah they don't come an old single weeks ahead of our visit we requested an interview with the Solomons Prime Minister about his sudden recognition of China while we're here we try again in person also wanting to ask him about his refusal to investigate the bribery allegations made by premier sue Danny as we're waiting a high-level Chinese delegation leaves the Prime Minister's office then hot on their heels Menace a saga VAR a himself hurries out head down and clearly in no mood to talk mr. Prime Minister 60 minutes Australia sir we just like to ask you a couple of questions about China mr. prime minister mr. prime minister can we ask you about the bribery money please amid all the claims of bribery corruption and kickbacks it appears the Chinese have another novel approach to increasing their presence here like leasing this entire island of Tuilagi for the next 75 years old ten square kilometers of it including the deepwater port oil and gas rights fishing rights forestry rights and tourism rights the Chinese want all of it and the locals are not impressed when I heard about it I thought that China is a communist country and we the Solomon Islands is a democratic country Margaret Manu is an unlikely enemy for China to make but here on Tuilagi where land ownership is matrilineal she's the voice of her people and the people here didn't want to be owned by the Chinese 60 minutes has obtained a copy of the lease document which is almost comical if it wasn't so sinister the agreement was signed by two ladies provincial leader who locals say hasn't been seen here since and luckily for Margaret and her people it was ruled unlawful when it became public so there was no consultation so the Chinese company just came in here and tried to have the agreement signed by one person and that was it that's what happened without that people knowing what's going on and what we're seeing now from our visits to the islands here is that the Chinese are coming in with soft power in lots of cash to buy out local officials to gain access to ports and airfields and resources that give them controlling monopoly in the islands and thus give them control over this vital sea lane coming up not welcome in paradise we're being followed by a government car why the government of pure of us there's something to do with the kinds of money that's being brought in doesn't like nosy reporters that's next of 60 minutes there's something both threatening and absurd about being tailed by a mysterious black sedan in a country that essentially has only one road it's mid-morning on our first day in Carabas the latest Pacific island nation to recognize Communist China and dump Taiwan we're being followed by a government car now whether that's curvas government or whether that's somebody from the government operating under Chinese instruction who knows very very strange thing to happen in a place like this with us is Captain Jim Finnell former intelligence chief of the US Navy's Pacific Fleet and someone who's witnessed firsthand how China does business in the Pacific it could be that the Chinese have said as part of this deal you're gonna have to pay more restrict attention to who's here and what they're doing few foreign journalists come here none since the country's abrupt switch of allegiance to China one reason is that Carabas requires a draconian film permit that journalists working in the region say is almost never granted and gives the government the right to completely censor any news reports we know we may meet trouble but have come anyway a move we'll soon find is supported by very senior figures in Pyramus is basically house arrest on arrival at our hotel were immediately placed under house arrest and threatened with imprisonment his pupils transmitted to self we are the sensitivities are running high here because Pyramus is critically important to China's Pacific master plan the immense swathe of Ocean Territory controlled by this tiny island nation is smack in the middle of a secure sea lane China wants to establish all the way to the Antarctic which it calls the blue economic passage so you think this blue economic passage as China puts it is is just the cover story it's just the start of what they want to do it's the start of a comprehensive plan that they have to dominate the region and at first it's with economic development but it will be followed by fishing fleets and maritime law enforcement and then eventually naval forces back at our hotel two very high-level visitors have demanded access to us despite the government agents guarding the entrance these guys have told us if we do anything they've made it quite clear today that if we leave the front door of this hotel will be put into a cell my target is the president the man on the right is Pyramus as founding father and first president sir era meyer to buy one of the most respected men in the south pacific with him his Carabas opposition leader tissa boo to Bonnie in this interview secretly filmed with their permission these senior figures told us we were right to come here without a permit also telling us there's media repression in their countries which has become more hardline since the current government's recognition of China I'm not surprised you know this is the action of a communist country no Genting us-bound sir era Maya and mr. t Bonnie also told us the Chinese doled out two hundred and fifty thousand dollars cash around these islands within weeks of Kira buses recognition of Beijing what sort of democratic country spies on journalists and puts them under house arrest we embarrassed to be part of that night will you be able to come to our aid if we get chucked in them so well it'll at least there's a little bit of democracy left on care of us perhaps safeguarded by the presence of these two men we were merely deported from Cubist's back to the Solomon Islands the following day why do you think the cure of US government is so paranoid about media crews telling the story of what's going on there well I think it's pretty clear that there's something to do with the kinds of money that's being brought in how that money's being distributed obviously would be something that they would probably not want people to know about or hear about [Music] and on the very day we arrived back in the Solomons an immense deal is announced for Chinese control of the country's only gold mine high above Honiara this is the goldrich mine it's an old gold mine that's been resurrected in the first major deal the Solomon Islands has done with China since it switched allegiances to the communist country incredibly China describes the 825 million dollar purchase and all the infrastructure it intends to build here as an early harvest and if you need evidence of advance Chinese planning we're told by a mine insider that the security guards uniforms complete with communist China's flag were ordered six months ago even though the diplomatic recognition that opened the way to this deal was only two months ago the Chinese will not only reap the direct profits from this gold mine but everything they build to service it roads railways and port facilities will remain in China's hands forever but just across the water there's potentially an even more glittering prize coming up that is truly enormous reasons when the biggest man-made hits in the world that Chinese want this piece of Bougainville China is now taking control of the South Pacific and why Australia is the big loser hysteria is making enemy other Bougainville that's next on 60 minutes on our tour of the Pacific we'd find conclusive proof of China's long-term planning for our region we're in Bougainville still part of Papua New Guinea but not for long next week it votes in a referendum on its independence Bougainville was one of the Forgotten campaigns of World War two but 516 Australians died here during the war 516 put that in context for me well that's comparable to Vietnam but veteran journalist Benbow Haines covered a far bloodier conflict here the Bougainville civil war where a rebel army fought New Guinea for independence and control of the fabulously wealthy Panguna gold mine over 10,000 people died between 1988 and 1998 they're given a small population here safe to say virtually every single family would have been affected one way or the other in small places like this every family was touched by the war one of the commanders of the Bougainville rebel army was general Sam : fully patient they they make war and we play the war now Benbow hain and I are headed to meet the general at his headquarters in the south of Bougainville main island it's hard to imagine fighting a war in this terrain harder still to imagine the infrastructure required to bring this place into the 21st century once it achieves independence but if it does general Kona is one of the leading contenders to become its first president supported by his formidable wife Jo see the general how confident are you that Bougainville will become independent I am sure I've seen if I'm going around the island north or south scene and have people expressing their feelings their views you've been campaigning relentlessly haven't you oh yes oh yes to make sure that they vote for independence but central to any hope Bergen Vil has of becoming a self-sustaining nation lies deep inland it's golden heart the mine called Panguna Benbow hain and i are being given rare access to this legendary place however look at that that is truly enormous one of the biggest man-made pits in the world it's estimated Panguna still holds nearly 60 billion dollars worth of gold and copper so that's what the war was all about and the future here too I guess yeah this is the mine that triggered the war and may well be key to the future of Bougainville it's an eerie place a frozen moment of the aftermath of water we make the Panguna rebel commander moses poppy ro who shows us the massive safe where the mines gold was once store now welded shut it contains the weapons his men laid down for peace how many weapons but if Bougainville is denied its independence by Papua New Guinea which has to ratify the referendum vote Moses as a Samba warning Moses is there any way in which those weapons would be used again when you see maybe boys coming again or we don't know in truth it's unthinkable but war will revisit this devastated place but restoring it to production seems almost equally impossible this mine is set to be the beating heart of a new Bougainville Republic and the blood pumping through it is destined to be foreign sourced the big question is will China win this - bogan will know is starting on a clean slate we will be looking at all our news what about China China inclusive yes China is the superpower in the world we are free Bougainville is free to be choosing whichever countries that we can have the best deal with on the eve of the independence vote an extraordinary revelation by general Konev a detailed plan for the complete infrastructure rebuild of the island and the plan is Chinese the first OVA has come from China this year with us we are still waiting for Australian Oprah USA offer over how they could support Bougainville roads ports and Airport all to be built by China but the general is adamant it's only because Australia and the US have offered nothing of the sort Australia even refused the general a visa an almost unforgivable insult you're saying if Australia is truly genuine you want an apology and you want us to do more now that's why I feel Australia is making an enemy out of sin Australia is making enemy out of Bougainville when they give me the treatment observing this with us is Captain Jim Finnell the former intelligence commander of the US Pacific Fleet who's been with us on this trip there's been no previous inkling that China has such a long term master plan for Bougainville and as our last stop it's alarming news for this experienced China watcher if Bougainville becomes the world's newest country that's quite a prize for China as now yes it is and it sets up but with the the flip that Kier Abbas and the flip in the Solomons and what they're doing in Vanuatu what they're doing in Fiji you start to see a trend line here which is that China is now taking control of the South Pacific and so I think that's why you're starting to see some change in the United States for instance and even in your own government in Australia where people are starting to say if we don't stand up and check China's expansionism we will be ruled by them in another 25 or 30 years hello I'm Liam Bartlet thanks for watching so keep up with the latest from 60 minutes Australia make sure you subscribe to our channel you can also download the 9 now

In this history documentary we explore the history of the US Navy. We begin in the colonial period of British rule where most of the coastal defenses were undertaken by jerry-rigged sloops and schooners while the Royal Navy handled the larger engagements. With the outbreak of the American Revolution however the Continental Congress was forced to create its own Continental Navy. This was composed of a small number of small frigates while the bulk of the American fleet actually consisted of privateers. The US fleet managed to score some wins at sea but it was the assistance of the French Navy which helped turn the tides of war. After the revolution, the new but bankrupt United States was forced to disband its navy. This had the effect of leaving it incredibly vulnerable. Over the following decades, the US Navy would slowly invest in rebuilding its fleet to combat threats from the Barbary Pirates and others who preyed on American shipping. The War of 1812 with the British saw the US score some early wins but saw it be utterly dominated at sea when the Royal Navy sailed in with a strong fleet that had just recently won the Battle of Trafalgar. The US Navy was expanded as a result of this embarrassment but it would be the conflict of the US Civil War which truly brought about a renaissance for American Fleet. During the conflict, the northern strategy at sea involved a blockade of the south which prompted an arms race between the Union Navy and the Confederate Navy. Ironclads and steam ships emerged from this evolutionary process and came dominate the waves. By the end of the war, the US Navy was the second largest in the world after the Royal Navy. The post war years however saw a decline in the Navy that would only be turned around with renewed conflict during the Spanish-American war. From this point on, the United States Navy was recognized as being critical to United States foreign policy. President Roosevelt would overseen it's renovation with the construction of the Great White Fleet which sailed around the world. However new technologies like the HMS Dreadnought risked making all contemporary warships obsolete. World War 1 came soon after and poured gasoline on the fire of innovation. Now the battle at sea extended to the air above the waves and the depths below it with the deployment of planes and submarines. Coming out of the First World War, the US Navy was recognized as an equal to the Royal Navy. The interwar years saw more funds poured into the American Fleet including the construction of new aircraft carriers. Word War 2 would see a massive overhaul of the US Navy as it battled the Imperial Japanese Navy across the Pacific. This conflict and the Cold War that followed solidified the power of the US Fleet and led it to become the force it is today.

I hope you enjoyed this documentary on US Navy history!

additional details the US Navy traces its origins back to the colonial period in these early days the 13 colonies belonged to the British Empire and worth us associated with its Royal Navy this fleet was one of the strongest of its time with the force of several hundred ships that campaigned across the world the Royal Navy would operate in the American theater to maintain its dominions with large scale deployments during the war of Jenkins ear against the Spanish in the 1740s and during the Seven Years War against the French in the 1750s however due to the great distances between the old world and the new most of the time the ships in operation in the Americas were of local make the colonies boasted a large number of commercial vessels for fishing and trade which were jerry-rigged into lightly armed schooners and sloops for naval operations when the need arose the captains of such vessels were often American privateers who had obtained letters of marque and reprisal from the to prey upon the enemies of Great Britain in times of war it is this early maritime tradition that would ultimately give rise to the US Navy the official creation of the US Navy is tied to the American Revolution of 1775 while preparations were being made to fight the British on land a similar scramble was taking place to combat them at sea to this end the colonies turned to their ragtag force of privateers over 2,000 Commission's would be put out calling on captains to answer the call to battle local governments also cobbled together their own small forces like the Massachusetts naval militia meanwhile the Continental Congress discussed the formation of an official navy to serve all thirteen colonies for over five months however they drag their heels in heated debate proponents argued that a navy was necessary for the war effort and to win over allies while detractors argued that it was a foolish diversion of precious resources that was doomed to fail eventually on October 13th 1775 the Continental Congress passed the resolution creating the Continental fleet and a seven member naval committee over the following months a series of warships were bought retrofitted or constructed the Continental Navy would remain small with the maximum strength of 34 ships whose size ranged between eight to thirty guns by comparison the Royal Navy had several hundred ships at its disposal which included many first-rate ships of the line carrying more than 100 cannons on board this incredible imbalance in power was partially made up by the colonial privateers which fielded several hundred of their own small ships the naval component of the American Revolution saw a few traditional pitched battles in these rare cases were Lions of colonial and British ships faced off the Royal Navy showed its supremacy as is demonstrated at the Battle of Valcour Island most of the action instead consisted of smaller encounters and raids on shipping lines or ports here the Continental Navy and in particular the privateers actually proved quite effective and took a pretty serious toll on the already strained British supply lines colonial forces didn't just operate along their own Shores instead they frequently sailed out into the Atlantic in 1776 for instance colonial forces launched an amphibious assault on the south in the Caribbean targeting a munitions depot in 1777 famed Captain John Paul Jones would sell the eighteen gun Ranger to attack the British coast and even land troops on enemy soil whilst in the European theater he would gain even more renown by winning a tactical duel with a superior Royal Navy frigate in which he was told to surrender by the enemy commander only to shout back I have not yet begun to fight despite scoring some symbolic victories the plucky colonial fleet had a rather checkered performance in the war it was only in 1778 that the balance of power at sea would favour the revolution when France officially joined the war against the British Franco American squadrons now tore into British shipping lines while the big guns of the French fleet entered the fight in the American theater this aid would prove critical to the war effort the French managed to defeat the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Chesapeake which allowed the British forces of Lord Cornwallis to be surrounded besieged and forced to surrender at Yorktown these victories proved to be turning points which soon brought about the end of the war with the cessation of hostilities came a drawdown in naval activities Congress were called all of its privateers and official frigates only a handful of which had survived the war by 1785 the Continental Navy was officially disbanded and its remaining ships auctioned off over the following decade the newly formed United States would find itself incredibly vulnerable at sea almost immediately American merchant shipping lines fell prey to attacks Corsairs from the Barbary States of North Africa in particular made a habit of seizing American ships and holding their cruise for ransom however the bankrupted Congress was hard-pressed to raise a fleet in defense or even to simply pay the ransom pressure continued to mount finally the naval Act of 1794 was passed or during the construction of six frigates of which only three were completed meanwhile tensions were escalating with European powers the French monarchy had just been overthrown in the midst of revolution and was now back to fighting the British the United States was caught in the middle and became the target of privateers from both sides a quasi war even developed with France when Congress refused to pay its debt to the new Revolutionary Government for two years American and French forces would joust across the Atlantic this had the effect of forcing the United States to finally take the Navy more seriously in preparation for the action ahead on April 30th 1798 Congress authorized the creation of the Department of the Navy and the office of the Secretary of the Navy at the start of the conflict the US Navy boasted 25 vessels which patrolled the coast and set off to hunt down French privateers in the Caribbean this new force was far superior to the ragtag force of the Continental Navy its ships now carried more firepower with over 40 guns apiece and its crews were far better trained in action this proved decisive by the end of the conflict in 1800 the French had lost two frigates and several dozen privateers at the cost of just one American warship though it should be noted that most of France's attention in this time was distracted elsewhere next the newly expanded US fleet would be turned to deal with the Barbary war in 1801 the engagement here was one of blockade with peace being settled by 1805 when Marines invaded the shores of Tripoli in these Affairs the Navy had proved it's worth but was once again forced to reduce in size for budgetary reasons once victory was achieved however this drawdown would only last a short time due to the outbreak of renewed conflict with the British in the war of 1812 the US Navy at this time had a fleet of just 12 frigates and 14 smaller ships which were once again supplemented by a large body of about 500 privateers the opening stages of the war saw ships like the USS Constitution the USS Wasp and the USS United States best their opponents repeatedly in one-on-one combat however when the main British fleet arrived towards the end of 1812 with 11 ships of the line 34 frigates and 55 smaller craft the balance of power swung decisively towards the Royal Navy the US Navy still managed to pull off some victories such as the Battle of Lake Erie but by-and-large command of the Seas was yielded to the crown after all the Royal Navy was still one of the most powerful forces in the world that had won great battles like Trafalgar just a few years earlier naval superiority allowed the British forces to blockade or raid coastal towns and support the action of the Royal Army which dealt the Americans several humiliating defeats including the burning of Washington DC ultimately the conflict drew to a close by 1814 when neither side could gain a decisive advantage and grew weary of the rapidly escalating costs as peace was concluded the US Navy would avoid being disbanded as it happened in 1785 and instead took its place as a permanent feature of the American armed forces the following decades would be a time of great expansion for the United States as its territory rapidly spread across the continent this was by no means a bloodless affair as many wars would be fought to defeat the native tribes that stood in the way a war was even fought with Mexico in 1846 to ensure that Texas would be included in the manifest destiny of America during this time the US Navy would be sub to the rising tide of an expanding American military agenda Congress recognized the importance of a long-term naval buildup and allocated funds to build six new seventy-four gunships of war and 1248 gun frigates the largest amongst these the USS Pennsylvania actually boasted 120 guns and would be the largest sailing ship ever to serve in the US Navy however without a war with any major naval power construction on these new vessels was rather slow this all coincided with the advent of new technology coming out of the Industrial Revolution the end was fast approaching for the age of sale and one wondered if the current generation of ships being built wouldn't just be obsolete by the time they hit the water the u.s. naval department recognized this dilemma and was sure to begin experimentation with the latest in steam-powered ships the first of these new vessels would be the demo logos warship that launched in 1814 though slow and unwieldy it served as an important indicator of things to come over the following years methods of propulsion were improved paddle wheels helped provide auxiliary power to the primary sail before eventually being capable of replacing it outright however these outboard wheels were susceptible to enemy fire and thus new screw driven propellers were adopted to move the propulsion system within the body of the ship but the 1840s virtually all new warships were outfitted with some form of this new steam-powered technology but while the scientists and engineers were busy preparing for the future the US fleet had hard work to do in the here-and-now its first priority was to protect America's expanding maritime commerce anti-pirate campaigns were launched across the Caribbean the West Indies the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Mexico naval squadron sailed up rivers to support army activities against inland Indian tribes and also conducted important blockade and amphibious assault operations during the Mexican War the US Navy yet further expanded its reach by sending expert across the world in the hip new trend that was gunboat diplomacy the most famous amongst these was Admiral Perry's visit to Japan which resulted in the strong-armed opening of the country to foreign trade but while the US Navy could bully less developed nations its fleet was still far smaller and less technologically advanced than the leading powers of the day as we shall see though upcoming war would serve to Alba catalyze the next wave of naval development outward expansion had not come without cost for the United States they were no longer so United especially when it came to the issue of slavery this and many other contributing factors led to the outbreak of civil war in 1860 with the country split there would now be two navies each would have its own strategy for winning the war the Union which controlled most of the industrial and shipping centers sought to leverage its numerically superior fleet to suffocate the south into submission with what was referred to as the Anaconda plan this strategy called for a strict blockade of the enemy's ports which was to be followed up by a drive down the Mississippi to split the rebellion in half to this end Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles purchased or leased any ship that would float and armed it for duty his efforts would rapidly increase the size of the US fleet from 90 to 260 ships within the first year of the war with hundreds more to come the Confederacy on the other hand lacked the resources to mount a similar blockade their efforts instead were aimed at blockade running capabilities and creating a small but powerful fleet of advanced ironclads they were not starting completely from scratch since roughly half of the US Navy's officer Corps had defected and a trove of Union ships and equipment was captured at Norfolk when it was seized by the Virginia militia blockade running efforts were mostly conducted by fast steamer ships operating out of England and manned by British sailors who had an interest in not only making a profit from the flicked but also finding a way to knock the u.s. down a peg as for the Confederacy's goal of a small but powerful fleet this would fall into the hands of the Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stefan Mallory he said about arming and purchasing a fast steamer squadron to assist in blockade busting and to prey on the Union merchant fleet out at sea closer to home Mallory would launch an ironclad program aimed at building ships so tough it would render the enemy's vessels useless the basic idea being to load up a steam-powered ship with as much armor as possible to withstand incoming shots while also boasting strong cannons and even ramming capabilities the first ship would be the CSS Virginia which was actually a retrofitted build of the USS Merrimack that had been captured at Norfolk it was a casemate design which basically just means at a giant armored shell with fixed cannon holes in it this is to be contrasted with the USS Monitor which featured a revolving turret that was being rushed through construction once news got out of the Confederates plan opponent's completion the monitor sped south to intercept the Virginia which had already taken out three Union frigates blockading Hampton Roads what resulted was a nearly three hour duel between ironclads though neither side could inflict significant damage on one another and ultimately parted ways the brief clash gained worldwide attention and had immediate effects on navies around the world it was clear to all that naval Wars of tomorrow would be won by this new class of warship the battleship had been born for the rest of the Civil War the Union and the Confederacy would compete in the development of iron clads this arms race also involved the development of other naval technologies like torpedoes mines and submarines overall however the south was unable to match the union's investment in resources and manpower by 1865 the Union had taken control of the Mississippi and New Orleans while the blockade had gotten significantly stronger such that the success rate of blockade runners dropped from 90% to less than 30% the Confederacy was slowly succumbing to the anacondas coils but the South would not go down without a fight at sea and on the rivers ironclads played an ever increasing role in naval warfare over the course of the war the Union would field over 50 of these ships while the Confederacy boasted 33 the Battle of Mobile Bay proved just how dominating they could be on the battlefield when it took about a dozen Union warships to take down the mighty CSS Tennessee eventually thanks in part to u.s. naval actions the Confederacy would ultimately be defeated and forced to surrender on April 9th 1865 the Civil War had raised the u.s. Navy - never before seen levels of development at its height in 1865 it had nearly 50 1000 men in uniform almost 700 ships afloat and roughly 60 ironclads altogether this made it the second largest in the world after the Royal Navy however the exorbitant costs could not be maintained and the post-war years saw a huge drawdown in naval strength within a decade the US Navy would only have a fleet of about 50 operational ships crewed by around 6,000 men the deterioration would continue as American priorities turn to other matters by the late 1870s most of the ironclads were laid up in dock yards that were ill-equipped and maintained in world standings the US Navy had dropped to 12th place however foreign danger would once again prompt action in 1873 an uptick in tensions with Spain coupled with the presence of a Spanish ironclad in the New York Harbor freaked out the Navy so much that it ordered the repair of several of its old ironclads while issuing contracts for the construction of five new battleships four of these were the m48 class monitors which should be starting to look quite familiar to us while these would have been impressive bastions of modernity much of the rest of the fleet was still composed of outdated wooden vessels in 1882 the Secretary of the Navy William hunt requested funds for the construction of new ships five new protected cruisers were built along with the very first battleships the USS Texas and the USS Maine with more to follow in the years to come in keeping with the latest in a military thinking they carried armored protection along their sides and around vital equipment while sporting guns with ever-increasing range yet further attention was brought to the Navy with the 1890s release of Alfred Thayer Maine's influential book on sea power clearly if the US were to be taken seriously as a world player in the upcoming century it had to be prepared to dominate the waves the truth of this lesson was driven home with the outbreak of the spanish-american war in April of 1898 fighting would largely be fought at sea around the territorial possessions of the Caribbean and the Philippines out west the United States Asiatic squadron under Commodore George Dewey would engage the Spanish Pacific Fleet at the Battle of Manila Bay the Spanish squadron was composed of outdated and inferior ships which were out ranged and outgunned by their American counterparts the result was one of the most decisive naval battles in history where an enemy fleet was crushed at the cost of only one slightly damaged vessel and a single death due to heat stroke u.s. naval power proved similarly decisive in the Caribbean theater and the war was brought to a swift conclusion in just over two months in this new world clearly those who failed to keep up with the technological evolutionary race would not survive coming off the back of its victory in the spanish-american war the United States had lofty Imperial aspirations in the 20th century in this regard President Theodore Roosevelt would lead the charge with his famous motto speak softly but carry a big stick this meant a huge investment in the Navy that would see it jump back up to being the second largest in the world as a way of celebrating Roosevelt would parade the new wait fleet around the world for all to see consisting of 16 battleships and numerous escorts it was a formidable show of power the epic 14 month journey also served as a training exercise for the Navy and taught it much about the logistics behind operating at such a large scale with World War 1 just around the corner this sort of experience would be invaluable however by the time the famed Great White Fleet was done showing off it was already at risk of being rendered obsolete the Royal Navy had just rolled out with its new revolutionary ship the HMS dreadnought what was so important about this ship was that in the past naval designers had always had to find a compromise with regards to speed versus armor and armament battleships were slow but powerful while cruisers were fast but weak the dread-nots managed to combine the two by producing a ship that was both fast and powerful it did so by introducing a brand-new type of steam turbine engine in addition the HMS dreadnought featured uniform main batteries for the first time which were controlled by an advanced fire control system immediately navies around the world raced to retrofit their fleets with the new design whilst engaging in a feverish dreadnought arms race America would start work on its own ships in 1909 called the USS Michigan South Carolina Delaware and North Dakota but it wasn't just on this front that the Navy would have to play catch-up the battle at sea now expanded to include the space above and below the waves in 1903 the Wright brothers had flown the world's first plane by 1910 the US would be experimenting with launching biplanes from its ship decks and in 1911 awarded its first contract for receiving aircraft meanwhile underwater submarines were also being deployed the US Navy acquired its first modern one with the commissioning of the USS Holland in 1900 it's descendants would become the plunger class sub five of which formed the first u.s. submarine fleet more would be produced but it would be the German u-boat that really led the pack in submarine technology the first world war broke out in 1914 but the United States under President Woodrow Wilson remained neutral with the general policy of appeasement however as Germany's submarine warfare took a greater and greater toll at sea including killing 128 Americans with the sinking of the Lusitania Wilson began to seriously plan for war the following year Congress passed the naval Act of 1916 which was to fund the construction of ten battleships six battle cruisers thirty submarines fifty destroyers and other support craft this would do much to catch up to the other major powers of the day which had just fought the massive naval Battle of Jutland however when the u.s. finally entered the war in 1917 it would not go on to partake in any pitched battles at sea rather the US Navy mostly focused on safely moving troops and material through u-boat infested waters the production of battleships thus quickly gave way to the mass production of two hundred and seventy-three destroyers and four hundred submarine chasers for convoy protection and u-boat suppression activities the new Navy Air Corps also got it in on the action when it came to flying reconnaissance and hunting submarines when the First World War ended on November 11th 1918 the US Navy's sixth battle squadron would join the Royal Navy as it watched the German fleet sail across the North Sea to formally surrender many of the ships in attendance on both sides would soon be decommissioned as the post-war years saw nations reduce their military budgets and the international community attempted to impose arms limitations the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 in particular prescribed a specific ratio of capital ships between treaty nations as a testament to how far the United States Navy had come it was recognized as co-equal to the Royal Navy with an allowance for up to five hundred twenty-five thousand tons of capital ships and 135 thousand tons of the emerging aircraft carrier type but only a couple decades would pass before the world erupted and to another globe conflict for the United States Navy this was a scenario that was the constant source of discussion and war plans would be developed to handle this eventually one of these the famous war plan orange looked across the Pacific towards a showdown with Japan which had in recent years been building itself up as a regional powerhouse to be reckoned with the Great Depression risked deteriorating the Navy's preparedness but President Roosevelt an old Navy man earmarked 238 million dollars from the National Industrial Recovery Act to build 32 new ships included in this count were two new aircraft carriers the USS Yorktown and the enterprise these would join the four carriers already in the US fleet as a growing recognition of the importance of air dominance in naval combat in the ensuing years leading up to World War two the US would build two more carriers six battleships three heavy cruisers thirteen light cruisers 83 destroyers and 38 submarines when world war ii broke out in Europe the United States was once again faced with the dilemma of whether or not to become involved but as Axis forces overran Western Europe and threatened eastern asia the u.s. was forced to consider the very real possibility that it would soon face a two-front war in response Congress passed the - ocean Navy bill in 1940 which pledged two billion dollars to double the size of the combat fleet by adding 257 ships and 15,000 naval aircraft the vast industrial capabilities of the United States now begin to turn official US involvement in the war would be kicked off upon the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941 which triggered declarations of war with Japan and Germany in these matters u.s. naval efforts would first be directed towards Japan initially the Imperial Japanese Navy began with a stronger force in the Pacific but by the end of the war would be absolutely dwarfed by the immense numbers of ships pouring out of American factories and dock yards to illustrate this point I'll refer you to a fantastic video produced by military history last suffice to say the Second World War was a truly transformative time for the u.s. Navy which propelled it to becoming the strongest in the world many new technological and doctrinal advancements would take place that were further developed over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries for now this is where we will conclude our video on the cusp of the final great leap of the US Navy but so far I hope we've been able to shed light on the many steps which led up to this critical moment in history stay tuned for more exciting content on this front and again a special thanks to all of our sponsors our researchers our writers and our editors if you like this video be sure to LIKE and subscribe for more content and check out the rest of our videos on the channel thanks for watching"
luTPMHC7zHY,Why China is building islands in the South China Sea,"China claims they aren't military bases, but their actions say otherwise. 

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It’s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world’s fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world’s shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It’s an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country’s EEZ belong to that country; they’re its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it’s shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN’s EEZ laws — except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line’s boundaries and rejecting other countries’ claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They’ve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries’ islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It’s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.

There's a 10,000 foot airstrip, an advanced radar station, a missile defense system, and about 200 troops. But the strangest thing about Fiery Cross Island is that two years ago, it didn't exist. And neither did the six other Chinese military bases that have been built on man-made islands in the South China Sea. If you look at this satellite image from 2014, you can see huge Chinese ships collecting around remote reefs in the Spratly Islands. An archipelago in the South China Sea. In this image, these ships are rapidly pumping sand and rock up onto the reef. They're building islands. And less than a year later, the Chinese had seaports air bases and buildings on their new islands and the world had taken notice. We continue our look this morning on what China does not want you to see the superpower is reclaiming land in seven spots in the South China Sea adding on average more than three-and-a-half acres everyday. With these islands times trying to lay claim to one of the most important areas of ocean in the world the South China Sea. The South China Sea is incredibly rich in natural resources 11 billion barrels of oil, 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and ten percent of the world's fisheries. Most importantly though, 30% of the world's shipping trade flows through here to the booming population centers and economic markets of Southeast Asia. It's an extremely important body of water and right now five countries lay claim to some part of it. Now, most countries base their claim off the UN Law of the Seas, which says a country's territorial waters extend 200 miles off their shore. An area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Countries have exclusive rights to all the resources and trade in there EEZ. It's their sovereign territory. So for example, any oil that's found within 200 miles off the coast of Vietnam belongs exclusively to Vietnam. But any area that isn't in an EEZ is regarded as international waters and it falls under UN maritime law which means everybody shares it. Now, every country in the South China Sea region uses this 200-mile EEZ threshold to determine its claims. All except China. China argued they have a historical claim to the South China Sea dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. And they mark it using a really confusing border called the nine-dash line. Following World War II, Japan who had dominated the entire region, lost all control of its surrounding seas. China used the moment to claim the South China Sea by drawing this imprecise line on the map that encompassed ninety percent of the South China Sea. It became known as the nine-dash line. When the UN established the 200-mile EEZ in 1973 China stuck to its own line, refusing to clarify its boundaries and ignoring claims by other countries. Now that brings us to the Spratly Islands. It's a remote barely inhabited cluster of islands currently claimed by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The Spratlys are both geographically and symbolically at the heart of South China Sea. That's because any country that can claim the Spratly islands can extend their EEZs to include them and gain exclusive rights to the surrounding territory. But it's really hard to legitimately claim uninhabited piles of sand so a few nations have built small buildings and ports on their claimed islands and even stuck a few people there. But China believes all the Spratly Islands belong to them which brings us back to why they're building islands there. Installing military bases on these new artificial islands took the dispute to a whole new level showing how China's potentially willing to defend its claims with force. Now this is about when the United States took notice. While the US has no claim in the South China Sea, it is the world's lone superpower and uses its massive Navy to defend international waters. China sees the US presence in the area as an encroachment in their backyard. When a US destroyer ship sailed just 12 miles off the shore of one of China's man-made islands and the Spratlys China sent out their own destroyer and a patrol boat as a warning. China is building these islands in order to increase control around the surrounding waters. Using a strategy that they've deemed ""The Cabbage Strategy"". Where they surround a contested island with as many ships as possible. In May of 2013 China sent several ships to Ayungin shoal, which is just 105 nautical miles off the coast of the Philippines, well within that 200 mile EEZ. The Philippines has eight soldiers stationed there. Like wrapping leaves around a cabbage the Chinese sealed off the Philippines access to Ayungin Shoal with fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers creating blockade so that the Filipinos can't receive shipments of food and supplies. By building their own man-made Islands China's essentially building naval bases. The more Islands they have the more ships they can support and more territory they can slowly take control of. And the Chinese cautiously use the cabbage strategy in the Spratly islands, taking over contested territory but in small steps avoiding the possibility of igniting a bigger conflict. But the disputes are intensifying. Countries are now actively arresting trespassers in waters that they claim and China could go a step further. Since 2015 they've threatened to declare an air identification zone above the South China Sea, declaring that all aircraft that fly through it would need Chinese permission. Now, publicly China insists that their intentions are not militaristic but their actions say otherwise and it's heightening tensions in the region Steve Bannon who sits on the US National Security Council and who is one of President Trump's closest advisors is almost certain that the US will go to war in the South China Sea. ""We're going to war in the South China Sea, I was a sailor there, a naval officer, we're going to war the South China Sea in five to ten years aren't we?"" ""there's no doubt about it"" But for now the disputes remain only in the legal and diplomatic realms that only occasionally break into minor clashes. In July 2016 the international court at the Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines who charged China with invading their rightful territory in the South China Sea. China dismissed the ruling and enforcement of the law doesn't seem likely. Even from the US who released a vague statement urging the two countries to ""clarify their claims"" and ""work together to resolve their disputes"" which is another way of saying ""we don't really want to deal with this"". In fact, as the conflict escalates and international courts get involved, the US is stuck in a tricky position. On one hand, they do not want to risk provoking a conflict with China. But on the other they want China to stop bullying their allies in the region. Up until now the US has managed the situation by continuing to patrol through the South China Sea. It's also likely that the US would fly fighter jets above the sea if China actually does declare an air identification zone. These are symbolic but effective ways of keeping Chine in check while not getting too involved in the details of the conflict. So far the disputes in the South China Sea have not become violent but countries are starting to defend their claims by increasing troop numbers, weaponizing their territory and provoking each other. It's a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention for better or for worse."

Viktor Józsa, Ron Hochsprung",1,"[Music] the fairchild republic a-10 lightning-bolt or simply the hog is one of the most iconic planes in the US Air Force a plane developed in the middle of the Cold War with a specific type of warfare in mind if the Cold War turned hot one area was destined to become a battleground a 50 kilometer corridor of lowland Valley's called the Fulda gap where any invading troops would be channeled on their march from East Germany to West Germany it was the shortest route to France Frankfurt and the strategically important Rhine River if war broke out this corridor would be a vital region to secure and each side of the Fulda gap was defended by armoured divisions to cope with this threat environment the u.s. developed an operational doctrine called air land battle and the a-10 was developed as a vital component of this strategy a low-flying tank killer which would work closely with the troops on the ground to break up enemy formations at the front while high-flying bombers harassed the supply lines at the rear the a-10 was a plane designed specifically for the role of close air support close air support is exactly that close close to friendly forces and close to unfriendly forces it requires a plane to be capable of absorbing a great deal of damage as they come under fire and to be incredibly accurate where its weapons to avoid friendly fire a plane with this role needs some unique qualities it needs to be available at a moment's notice in an ever-evolving battlefield troops could need support without warning and because of this the plane needs to be nearby and ready to go this means working from forward bases that may not necessarily have all the infrastructure and equipment that other planes need to operate it's survivability needs to be in class flying this close to the ground is going to result in every man with weapon taking potshots at the plane as a result the plane needs to be capable of dealing with small arms machine guns anti-aircraft guns and even missiles a tense frequently limp back to their base would damage so severe that they would have downed another plane with parts of their wings ripped off with an engine taken out and hydraulics on operational and coming with this the plane needs to be simple and cheap to manufacture the air force made it clear from the beginning in a battle of cost versus performance cost would be prioritized in an all-out war with the Soviets quantity and ease of manufacturing was going to be a huge factor like the Sherman and the t-34 tanks which were so influential in world war ii a future war between the Soviets and the US was expected to be won by whoever could out manufacture and maintain their equipment this plane was intended to be a cheap and rugged warhorse it needed to be made with readily available off-the-shelf parts so maintenance crews could easily interchange parts to repair damage quickly and at a low cost contractors bidding for the manufacturing contract needed to consider all of these factors and designed the entire plane around the primary urnament which was chosen before the design process started the General Electric gau-8/a a gun whose sound is so recognizable it has become a meme the gun takes up a significant portion of the plane's internal volume at nearly 6 metres long fitting snugly below the pilot the largest part of the gun is the ammo drum which typically holds 1,150 30 millimeter rounds the rounds are delivered to the 7 rotating barrels along a linkless shoot system which also pulls the shell casings back into the ammo drum after firing to prevent the expanded shells from damaging the plane the belt system and the rotating cam firing system of the barrels are both driven by a hydraulic motor which is powered by two independent hydraulic systems onboard there are two separate hydraulic systems to ensure redundant see in operation and both run the gun the left and right hydraulic systems are pressurized by two identical engine driven pumps on the left and right engine if an engine is lost or one of the hydraulic lines is broken than the controls powered by those hydraulics ceased to work however the plane has been designed to allow it to continue flying on only one hydraulic system as both elevators both ailerons and one rudder have hydraulic power after loss of either hydraulic lines ensuring powered control of pitch roll and yaw even after the loss of a single hydraulic system if both are lost the plane can switch to a manual reversion flight control system where the controls can be operated without power assists which is difficult to say the least but it can allow the pilot to land the plane safely or at the very least allow them to get into safe airspace to eject this kind of redundancy can be found in every component of the a10 to increase survivability the landing gear is retracted by the LES system only but it can be extended by both and in the event neither system is available the wing mounted landing gear doesn't actually retract all the way into the pharynx which allows the plane to land with landing gear retracted with only moderate damage to the plane protecting the control mechanisms through redundancy is just one component of increasing survivability the fuel tanks are self-sealing on the lower portions and are filled with foam to prevent explosions the a-10 like all planes can fly with significant armor covering every portion of the plane so they just protect the most vital component on the plane the stick operator otherwise known as the pilot who sits inside a titanium tub which is reported to be capable of absorbing direct hits from armor-piercing rounds up to 23 millimeters the canopy is also made from ballistic glass capable of taking hits from small-arms but this isn't the type of plane to be flying upside down over the battlefield this is more for shrapnel from anti-aircraft fire and missiles the a-10 also carries more chaff and flares than any US air legacy fighter chaff is radar reflective material which confuses radar controlled missiles while flares confuse heat-seeking missiles with four dispensers located in the landing gear pods and another four on the outer wing tips for a total of sixteen across both wings which can be triggered automatically by radar and laser detection systems on the nose and wingtips of the plane or simply fired manually by the pilot one of the most striking features of the a-10 is its strange engine placement and tail configuration and this too was a design feature to thwart enemies with heat-seeking missiles the engines and tail were arranged like this to mask the infrared signature of the hot exhaust of the plane which could be used to lock on to the plane by IR missiles on the ground the tail would look more at home on a world war two bomber which were designed to be stable stability was an important part of the a tense design the large vertical stabilizers helped keep the plane on target as it fires its insanely powerful gun the gun is mounted directly on the centerline of the plane to minimize the effect of the recoil pushing the plane off target the recoil force at 40 4.5 kilonewtons is so powerful that it effectively halves the planes for thrust as each of the eight ends General Electric t-34 engines produces just 41 kilonewtons of thrust but the plane fires in such short bursts typically one to two seconds that the pilot doesn't need to worry about Salling the high engines mounted behind the wings also reduced the amount of dirt and dust that can enter the engines from forward-operating base runways which can be just dirt runways a lot of design choices were made to allow the plane to operate from remote airfields like this smaller military planes like this don't typically have auxilary power units which are small secondary engines that large planes like airliners have you can see the exhaust of these little hidden engines in the tails of airliners these engines allow the plane to start its main engines without external help and help run functions like electricity generation and hydraulic fluid pumps but it's a necessary weight for most small aircraft and they usually use some other way to get the engine spinning sometimes this results in the plane relying on ground equipment which the a-10 cannot depend on and so an AP was installed between the two potted engines you can see the exhaust of the APU just underneath the nacelle x' here some of the most interesting design challenges arose from the sheer power of the aircraft's gun the gun spits out so much burnt anon burnt propellant that they actually lost an early model in 1978 after exhaust gas from the gun ignited and starved the engines of oxygen to deal with this some design changes were made first a small gas scoop was placed underneath the barrels to suck in some of that exhaust the chemical mixture of the round propellant was changed to increase the flashes of present levels this in turn caused secondary problems as the new chemical mixture caused residue to build up on the cockpit windows and a canopy washer was needed which simply sprayed the washing fluid onto the canopy and the slipstream did the rest of the work circuitry was also added to force the engine ignition system to continually fire while the gun trigger was being pulled so that in the event a flame out occurred the engine could rekindle its flame immediately the gau-8 avenger is a monstrous machine designed to wreak havoc on those Soviet tanks attempting to push through allied lines to do this they need heavy armor-piercing rounds the rounds are truly massive at 30 millimetres and sprinkled throughout these rounds are rounds made of aluminium with a depleted uranium core uranium is insanely dense at nineteen point one g/cm^3 lead in comparison is eleven point three grams per centimeter cubed and iron is 7.9 this density gives the round more kinetic energy for armor-piercing the depleted uranium also ablates material in a way that self sharpens the projector while tungsten which is slightly denser than uranium tends to mushroom out and doles itself upon impact there is currently 700 thousand metric tons of depleted uranium stored as uranium hexafluoride in huge storage cylinders across America costing uranium enrichment facilities a great amount in maintenance they are simply delighted when someone gets it off their hands and fires it at high speed into a country thousands of miles away it's a cheap and freely available resource and has the perfect material properties for armor-piercing but the efficacy of using depleted uranium is obviously not good many war-torn regions have blamed its use for elevated cases of cancer the a-10 has been under constant threat of retirement detractors have pushed from the very start that the plane is not needed first it was the f-16 which should take over its job and now it's the f-35 and both sides of the argument have valid points the f-16 and a10 can carry similar amounts of ordnance into the battlefield if needed both have 11 hard points where the carrying capacity over 7.2 tonnes but attaching heavy equipments to its wings negates the biggest advantage of the f-16 its maneuverability and ability to conserve kinetic energy in dogfights the f-16 was designed to be a multi-role fighter while the a-10 was designed for one job and one job only getting down and dirty and taken some punches like Rocky while modern planes like the f-35 were designed to be more like Muhammad Ali bobbing weaving illusive striking and moving out of the enemy's range before they can react the two planes were designed in completely different eras with completely different military doctrine in mind and trying to compare the two without acknowledging that is silly the f-35 is designed to carry a small payload of weapons in its internal weapons Bay while stealth is a high priority but it can carry just as much as the f-16 when air superiority is established it's a multi-role fighter designed for the modern battlefield ultimately the a-10 found a role in wars like Iraq and Afghanistan where the threat level and sophistication of enemy weaponry was relatively low like the battles expected in the folder gap in the 1980s the a-10 persists today because it excels in its role as a close air support vehicle and it's low cost of running compared to other military planes has kept it competitive allowing us to be in the vanguard for military operations today he planed the infantry can see coming over the horizon like Gandalf arriving into helms deep to lift the siege it's become an iconic aircraft among the soldiers on the ground a bond has formed between us and the infantry it protects but just as the a-10 was created in preparation for an anticipated next-generation war the f-35 was created with future Wars in mind where the threat environment will be so dense that simply being able to take a punch won't save us the nature of close air support has continually evolved over the past century in world war ii tactical air forces were created specifically for providing close air support to the troops landing in Normandy on d-day range for these fighters was a major tactical issue and within 24 hours of the first men landing in Normandy three new emergency landing strips had been created off the beaches which would allow the Allies to extend their fighter bomber range and prevent a fierce counter-attack by the Germans from overwhelming the small toehold the Allies managed to carve out in Normandy I explored these vital logistical challenges in a future episode of the logistics of d-day that will be out next month these airfields were primarily built to extend the reach of Allied aerial support as ground troops push forward however as the front line progressed many were converted to supply depots emergency evacuation posts and heavy bomber airfields others were simply abandoned and allowed to return to farmland over time there are hidden traces of these remains littered all over Normandy you can learn more about them and get access to the entire logistics of d-day

dRlWSke4vYk,"LIVE: U.N. General Assembly to vote on a Ukraine resolution, marking nearly one year of war","The United Nations will vote on a resolution on Ukraine on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion. The United States declared that the vote by the 193-member body will ""go down in history.""

#Reuters #live #news #Ukraine #UN #UNGA #GeneralAssembly #war #UkraineRussia",1,one year ago we are doing it again today there can be no fatigue when it comes to violations of the charter and and other fundamental breaches of the international order this is the reason why Djibouti will vote in favor in favor of the draft resolution before us today thank you for your attention thank the distinguished representative of Djibouti Mercy mission now I give the flow to the distinguished representative of Nigeria Mr President the global Community has evolution in the recent past and do what many disasters the most accurate ones being in Ukraine Pakistan turkey and Syria the courses and remedies vary yet all have been accompanied by loss of thousands of lives properties and displacement many countries entities individuals have stepped up in support of human beings who found themselves in these conditions this is the kind of similarity the United Nations advocates for provide and organizes Nigeria continues to express concerns over the ongoing war against Ukraine and regrets the inability of the International Community to broker peace between the Russian Federation and Ukraine both of whom are members of this assembly the humanitarian crisis is worsening and cities and towns in Ukraine are being destroyed even Beyond Ukraine hardly can we point a country unaffected by the consequences of the war Nigeria is committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international law it it upholds violations of the uncharter despite continuation of aggression against Ukraine Mr President member to this organization must prioritize and in this world thereafter working towards sustainable the Russian Federation and Ukraine Nigeria commands efforts of the Secretary General and the Republic of Turkey in history ensuring supplies of Grants to countries that needed them most and ensuring humanitarian access we should deepen this approach by focusing on stopping the preventing further loss of life and destruction of towns and cities causing terrible displacement countries and entities that have influenced on the two countries need to work with the United Nations to achieve this objective we all have sounded Society in this it is Nigeria's firm belief that the cause of peace in our world will be eminently enhanced if among other things we overcome the will to embed and occupy and the tendency to assume it right that some countries are merely security zones or zones of control by others has guided us for so long even with some of his social structural limitations of all the elements of the charter of our organization the most important ones are the principles of respect of possibility of states and the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes while Nigeria strongly believes in the need to hold all parties accountable for the crimes committed we register our reservation about op9 of the tax in the draft L7 principles of the charter of the United Nations underline a comprehensive just and Lasting peace in Ukraine the most urgent accountability is for us to see whatever resources other than violence at our disposal we can use whatever resources at a disposal to guarantee that this was stops Nigeria will not is not fully sure that op9 is really helpful in stopping the war it may Harden positions and make getting a solution more difficult in addition not only the mechanism for the investigation and prosecution is unclear in the text is also not difficult to see how the assembly would be broke down for years to come over which aggressions by some member states should be treated in the seminar or which ones should be prioritized the light of these and other considerations that Nigeria will vote in favor of the resolution but reserve on on Pro Group nine we may well decide at an appropriate time to have a forecast honest if difficult discussion about accountability in all cases of United action occupation and settlement against several states with a determination to make these end and Achieve genuine reconciliation the solidarities that we have seen in giving Comfort to victims in Ukraine turkey Syria and Pakistan recently should give us hope that this is both necessary and possible in conclusion Mr President in line with the chart of the United Nations and especially concerning the invaluability of Voters and peaceful settlement of disputes Nigeria will vote on the conclusion while designing opinion affirms what we all sign on to and looking at the consequences although any Quran on ukrainians on the rest of the world are just focused attention first of dissociation although I thank you I thank the distinguished representative of Nigeria now I give the flow to the distinguished representative of Nepal thank you Mr President Mr President my delegation is deeply distressed by a year-long conflict death and Devastation in Ukraine it has posed an extreme danger to International Peace and security Untold our sorrows and ramifications of the conflict be death and Devastation in Ukraine disruption of global supply chain food insecurity and inflation worldwide peaceful coexistence mutual respect for sovereignty territory integrity and non-aggression as enshrined in the United Nations Charter are the fundamentals of Nepal's foreign policy the United Nations started unequivocally stipulates that all member states shall refrain and their international relations from the threat or user Force against the international against the territory integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations further the charter says all members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that International Peace and security and Justice are not in danger Mr President security and stability of one and all countries are founded on these very principles Nepal's position has been clear from the very beginning of this conflict based on the foundation of U.N Charter and international law Nepal has astute for the sovereignty and territory Integrity of Ukraine and the protection of its civilians Nepal has clearly pronounced that no solution can arrive through hostilities and conflict Mr President as provided by the United Nations Charter dialogue and diplomacy are the tools for resolving disputes and differences as a peace loving country Nepal reiterates its call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and the creation of conditions for dialogue and diplomacy and we urge old efforts by the parties in Conflict as well as the International Community should be channelized to create conditions for peace the draft resolution and just peace in Ukraine is before us today the draft could articulated the Primacy of negotiation and dialogue and created a condition of just and Lasting peace in Ukraine which we believe is the fundamental for achievement of the durable piece in Ukraine nevertheless we believe the draft resolution is intended to protect the sovereignty territorial integrity and Independence of Ukraine and bring peace in Ukraine in this context with a firm belief in U.N Charter and settlement of international disputes through peaceful means my delegation will support the draft resolution that is before us thank you Mr President I thank the distinguished representative of Nepal now I give the flow to the distinguished representative of South Africa Mr President South Africa continues to express its deep regret that the war in Ukraine which tomorrow marks its first anniversary continues to destroy innocent lives and critical infrastructure as well as the displacing Millions this is a war whose impact has resonated across the globe affecting the livelihoods of the most vulnerable and heightening the current debilitating Global Food Fuel and finance crisis sadaka wishes to stress it's unwavering belief in the purposes and principles of the U.N Charter we believe that sovereignty and territorial Integrity of all states should be sacrosanct and this also applies to Ukraine Mr President we also affirm in a resolve that urgent actions are needed to end the war however it is a certain document of our efforts that we as the International Community have been unable to come up with concrete proposals to create the conditions to do so as South Africa has stated before in this assembly diplomacy and dialogue is the only path that will lead to a sustainable and peaceful resolution of the conflict today we consider yet another resolution on the war in Ukraine which comes amidst an influx of arms to the region perpetuating greater acts of violence and increased human suffering this together with the thread of nuclear war makes peace seem less attainable over the last year this assembly has adopted a series of resolutions on Ukraine as we have asked this assembly before our ways and actions focused on the maintenance of peace or creating further divisions that make the attainment of immediate peace less likely while we support the present resolutions focused on the principles of the charter and international law it certainly brings us no closer to lean the foundations for a durable peace and bringing an end to the devastation and destruction what we need is a femme an equivocal commitment to peace from all parties I thank you I thank the districts representative of South Africa now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Thailand Mr President Thailand reiterates our unequivocal adherence to the U.N Charter both in letter and spirit as well as to international law as the non-arbitrary point of reference for standards of conduct of Nations Thailand upholds the people's rights to live in safety with their basic well-being as universal and non-negotiable humanitarian consideration must not be politicized and discriminatory we urge the United Nations to dispense its best and most earners effort in preventive diplomacy to safeguard these basic human rights around the world and not to become a part of the morality play that turns very complex situations into simple binaries of Good and Evil followed by finger-pointing and condemnations utmost efforts should be carried out to create conducive environments for engagement and dialogues to settle disputes once they erupt rather than adding fuel to the fire the Hippocratic Oath should apply in all the U.N Endeavors quote First Do no harm unquote on the one year anniversary of war in Ukraine we urge all members of this prestigious body to do the right thing by The World At Large and by the 8 billion people who are simply bystanders but are bearing the brunt of the war in very many different ways for the peace settlement process to start we must try to understand the root causes of the conflict in an objective and non-myopic manner devoid of the power and morality Play Elements the world is vast and Rich enough for countries with diverse ideologies and political form of government to coexist peacefully if we learn to respect the differences and heed our respective existential more weapons escalate fighting more fighting worse since human suffering more sanctions intensify human pain and have never led to regime change condemnations bear no positive weight on altering Behavior or conducts Thailand calls on all parties to step up the Diplomatic effort to engage in dialogues to achieve a peaceful negotiated settlement as an exit to the Ukraine conflict the war in Ukraine represents an unprecedented and most dangerous challenge that threatens the geopolitical financial Economic Security and Collective balance of the World At Large it was said diplomacy is the continuation of War by other means Wars cannot be settled by deployment of more lethal weapons not unless total Destruction and human casualties are the only objectives and the only option available Wars can only be settled by engagements and dialogues by pragmatism not ideology and not by the winner take all mindset as in Isaiah 1 18 it is now time for all nations to come and quote reason together unquote thank you Mr President I thank the distinguished representative of Thailand now I give the flow to the distinguished representative of Angola thank you Mr President excellences the resolution that we are about to adopt is being discussed at the time when the conflict in Ukraine over a period of more than 12 months as claimed in a calculable human lives and caused multiple doses of material Goods we consider document a slash es slash 11 slash l.7 to be progressed in view of the fact that International Community is showing clear signs of support for the process of seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict and the making efforts to bring the parties closer together for a lasting peace in Eastern Europe region on the other end as United Nations General Assembly is the most representative body of our organization we think it is important that the intergovernmental process is inclusive it is therefore imperative that the document as everyone's contribution erasing it so that we can have Ukraine and Russia coexisting peacefully a more stable and strong region and an increasingly peaceful word Angola will abstain during the vote we are of the opinion that operative paragraph mind is not conducive to creating an environment conducive to the start of peaceful negotiations we do not see difficulties with the other paragraphs Republic of Angola defends the notion of accountability of crimes committed by any of the parties however we do not think this is the right time to have a paragraph in the resolution and not to undermine the Secretary General efforts and initiatives to promote a lasting and comprehensive peace between the two countries excellencies we would like to reiterate that Republic of Angola is on opinion that the conflict resolution between Russia and Ukraine can only be resolved through dialogue and therefore the general assembly of United Nations must maintain its interest in preserving the principles of peaceful coexistence among member states I thank you Mr President I thank the distinguished representative of Angola now I offer the floor to the distinguished representative of Brazil thank you Mr President Mr President Brazil has decided to vote in favor of the draft resolution before us because of the urgent need for this General Assembly to reaffirm its unwavering commitment to uphold the core principles of the U.N Charter and international law while underscoring the need to reach peace we commend the facilitators for the inclusive negotiations in our view the most important element of the resolution is the call for the International Community to redouble its efforts to achieve a just and Lasting peace in Ukraine we also appreciate the important humanitarian element of the resolution including the call for full adherence of all parties to their obligations under International humanitarian law all possible measures must be adopted to minimize the suffering of the civilian population it is high time to start peace talks rather than fuel the conflict Brazil considers the call for the cessation of hostilities in op5 as an appeal to both sides to Halt violence without preconditions no alleged difficulties to implement our call to stop hostilities as as set forth in this paragraph must be seen as an obstacle to start negotiations this resolution must be construed as an important step to pave the way for peace the conflict that started a year ago has imposed immense suffering on civilians it also entailed a number of consequences for many countries especially in the developing World due to its impacts on food fertilizer and energy prices the time has come to open space for dialogue and to begin reconstruction Brazil stands ready to participate in the efforts for a lasting solution to this conflict I thank you Mr President a distinguished representative of Brazil and now I offer the floor to the distinguished representative of Malaysia Mr President Malaysia has been following closely the ongoing conflict in Ukraine we are deeply concerned over the increase in civilian casualties and in the number of displaced persons as well as the destruction of Civilian infrastructure which continues to this day in any armed conflict it is always the affected civilians men women young and old who suffer the most as such we urge all parties to fully comply with their obligations under International humanitarian law and international human rights law at the same time Malaysia wishes to see an immediate end to hostilities and the start of peaceful negotiations Malaysia believes that for Meaningful dialogue and negotiations to start all sides must take into consideration the legitimate security concerns of both Ukraine and Russia given the complex geopolitical context this must be addressed through dialogue and peaceful means in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and the rule of law Malaysia has and will continue to uphold the principles of respect for the sovereignty and the independence and territorial Integrity of states staying faithful to these principles Malaysia will vote in favor of this resolution Mr President militia regrets what we see as the inability or unwillingness of the security Council to discharge its primary responsibility to maintain International Peace and security the general assembly has adopted six resolutions related to the ongoing conflict but the situation on the ground Remains the Same if not worse in this regard Malaysia calls on all parties concerned to take immediate steps to de-escalate to prevent further loss of lives and destruction today we have heard calls and appeals for a comprehensive just and Lasting Peace by fellow delegates malicious strongly echoed these calls and appeals Mr President finally Malaysia wishes to register our disappointment over the fact that there were no open-ended discussions with member states at Large we feel that there should be more open-ended consultations so that the larger membership of the UN would be able to engage with the pen holders in order to add their views especially since this is the sixth resolution on the issue Malaysia Retreats our commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes Guided by the principles and Shrine in the UN Charter and under international law in the interest of maintaining Regional and International Peace and security I thank you I thank the distinguished representative of Malaysia now I give the flow to the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom thank you Mr President I will be brief before we vote on the main resolution allow me to address the Amendments proposed by Belarus they have been put forward by a state that has facilitated Russia's invasion that provided the staging ground for the early attempt to cop to topple Kiev and that is among a small number of states that have consistently voted against upholding Ukraine's rights under the UN Charter the amendments attempt to create a false equivalence between Russia which this general assembly and the Secretary General have made clear is engaged in a full-scale invasion and Ukraine which is exercising Its Right of self-defense against that aggression put simply these amendments are an attempt to undermine the charter they're not aimed at peace but at defending the aggressor they are not proposed in good faith so we urge member states to vote against these amendments so we can move to vote in favor of the resolution that genuinely seeks a comprehensive just and Lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the UN Charter and I thank you I thank the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom excesses We Have Heard the Last speaker in the explanation of vote before the vote I wish to address the question concerning the majority required for the adoption of the draft resolution in light of article 18 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the charter of the United Nations they are any of is there any objection to taking action on draft resolution a slash ES 11 L7 by 2 3 majority of the members present and voting I see none the two-thirds majority of member State members present and voting is therefore required for the adoption of the draft resolution a slash es 11 L7 [Music] the two-thirds majority of members present and voting is therefore also required for the adoption of the

representative of South Sudan Mr President takes the floor in explanation of vote after devote in favor of the resolution just adopted since the Inception of the conflict year ago so Sudan has maintained and continuously cast an abstained vote as a country that emerged from the longest Civil War in the country in the continent and is implementing a peace agreement which many of you in this chamber helped to deliver We join we joined to vote in favor of the draft with a singular reason that this conflict needs to stop its Devastation has been experienced far and widely therefore through our vote we strongly call for a peaceful and Speedy settlement through a negotiated mechanism agreed upon by the parties to the conflict it is our considered belief that there is no military solution to the conflict then the destruction we have witnessed thank you Mr President South Sudan now I give the flow to the distinguished representative of Indonesia Mr President one year after the War Began in Ukraine we are no closer to peace death suffering and destruction continues to mount the impact of the war has gone beyond the borders of the countries in conflicts Indonesia voted in favor for the resolution because we believe upholding the principle of the U.N Charter and international law including peaceful resolution of dispute respect for human rights and the rule of law are fundamental to resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine despite this we deeply regret that critical Elements which we constructively suggested in the drafting process are missing in the final draft in this regard we believe the resolution adopted today may not have achieved the intended goal which is to help bring the countries at War closer to peace the resolution is missing the spirit to realizing peace in Ukraine nor does the resolution call on the International Community to create condition conducive to ending the war most notably the resolution is missing the call for the two parties in Conflict to pursue dialogue diplomatic means and enter into direct peace negotiation ultimately the two parties themselves are the ones that can and must prevent further downward spiral and end the war we are also concerned that the resolution failed to avoid a zero-sum game approach to resolving the underlying problem as such approach will only deepen The Divide between the conflicting parties Mr President the general assembly is the most inclusive organ of the United Nations its resolution reflects the collective voice and statement of 193 members of the United Nation it is therefore fundamental that its resolution be factually correct accurate inclusive and balanced GA resolutions are not social media content The credibility of our August institution is put on the line if resolution put forward by the ga spins factual information the resolution adopted today was leaning very close towards this direction Mr President we must continue to work towards a world where aggression and violence have no place and where the principles of international law and human rights are respected we must not apply double standards in addressing situation of conflicts in all parts of the world whether that is the war in Ukraine in Palestine or any other part of the world Indonesia stands ready to support all efforts towards peace and stability and we call on the International Community to do so I thank you Mr President I thank the distinguished representative of Indonesia now I offer the floor to the distinguished representative of lesser two [Music] Mr President the suit is taking the flaw in expression of position after the adoption of ESS resolution a stroke es slash 11 L7 entitled un Charter principles underlying comprehensive just and Lasting peace in Ukraine we must always remember that we came together under the United Nations as peace loving states which accept the obligations contained in the U.N Charter in the Judgment of the organization are able to are able and willing to carry out these obligations on everything we do persuadance of international peace and stability should be our goal needless to mention that Article 2 subsection 3 enjoins all member states to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that International Peace and security and Justice are not endangered it is on this premise that leso today it's effects itself from Preamble of paragraph 7 and operative paragraph five the resolution clearly states the principles to be flawed to achieve comprehensive just and Lasting peace in Ukraine however the conflict in Ukraine shows no signs of abating the Soto family believes that respect for sovereignty territorial integrity and political Independence are as unshrenched as enshrined in the United Nations Charter as a Christian principles and should be respected and upheld by all member states at all times for the attainment of sustainable International Peace vote was made motivated by genuine desire for peace the situation in green raises serious concerns with political economic and security ramifications for Europe and the rest of the world the men on which the resolution is framed further creates distance between war and parties and does not indicate any immediate steps for diplomatic Solutions as well as Endeavors that would hasten a peaceful settlement of the conflict allow me to conclude Mr President by retreating that Lesotho would like to see the International Community constructively supporting parties in the search for sustainable peace I thank you I thank the distinguished representative of Lesotho now I give the flow to the distinguished representative of India Mr President India continues to remain concerned over the situation in Ukraine the conflict has resulted in the loss of countless lives and misery particularly for women children and the elderly with Millions becoming homeless and forced to seek shelter in neighboring countries reports of attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are also deeply concerning we have consist advocated that no solution can ever be arrived at the cost of human lives in this context our prime minister's statement that this cannot be an era of war base repetition escalation of hostilities and violence is in no one's interest instead an urgent return to the path of dialogue and diplomacy is the way forward Mr President India's approach to the Ukraine conflict will continue to be people-centric we are providing both humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and economic support to some of our neighbors in the global South under economic distress even as they stare at the escalating costs of food of fuel and fertilizers which has been a consequential Fallout of the ongoing conflict Mr President the overall objective of today's resolution seeking a comprehensive just and Lasting peace in line with the UN Charter is understandable we also note the emphasis on increasing support by member states for diplomatic efforts to achieve peace as well as support for the secretary General's efforts to promote a comprehensive just and Lasting peace in Ukraine however reports from the ground portray a complex scenario with the conflict intensifying on several fronts today as the general assembly marks a year of the Ukrainian conflict it is important that we ask ourselves a few pertinent questions are we anywhere near a possible solution acceptable to both sides can any process that does not involve either of the two sides ever lead to a credible and meaningful solution has the UN system and particularly its principal organ the U.N security Council based on a 1945 World construct not been rendered ineffective to address contemporary challenges to Global Peace and security Mr President India remains steadfastly committed to multilateralism and upholds the principles of the UN Charter we will always call for dialogue and diplomacy as the only viable way out while we take note of the stated objectives of today's resolution given its inherent limitations in reaching our desired goal of securing lasting peace we are constrained to abstain thank you I thank the distinguished representative of India now I give the flow to the distinction representative of Pakistan right thank you Mr President Mr President Pakistan has abstained on the draft resolution contained in document a stroke es11 stroke L7 I wish to explain the reasons for our vote Pakistan is deeply concerned by the conflict in Ukraine which has caused and is causing immense human suffering in Ukraine and massive damage to its infrastructure economy and Society we acknowledge the considerable effort made by the co-sponsors to moderate the tone and language of the draft resolution Pakistan fully supports the resolutions call for respect for the principle of the sovereignty Sovereign equality and territorial Integrity of states and non-acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force States cannot be torn apart by the use of force Pakistan regrets that these principles have not been universally applied and respected for instance in the situation of foreign occupation and the ongoing attempt at the illegal and forcible annexation of Jammu and Kashmir Pakistan also endorses the resolutions call on member states and international organizations to redouble their support for diplomatic efforts to achieve a comprehensive just and Lasting peace in Ukraine while the hostilities continue there is an ever-present danger of a further military and geographical escalation of the war there is thus an imminent threat to Global Peace and security Mr President while my delegation agrees with and endorses principles and general Provisions contained in the draft resolution there are some Provisions which are not consistent with Pakistan's principled position on some of the elements covered in the resolution as a country that has seen and suffered the consequences of prolonged conflict in our neighborhood we attach highest priority to the immediate cessation of hostilities and the resumption of a dialogue to achieve a just and durable solution through direct or indirect negotiations mediation or other peaceful means in this regard we see an important role for the United Nations and the Secretary General interrelia under chapter 6 and 8 of the U.N Charter for efforts aimed at de-escalation renewed negotiations and sustained dialogue for a peaceful diplomatic solution Mr President consistent with our position on the draft resolution in document Ace stroke es 11 stroke L7 we have also abstained on the Amendments proposed to the resolution by Belarus in documents a stroke es11 stroke L8 and a stroke es11 stroke L9 Mr President Pakistan continues to hope that in a constructive approach the parties will soon accept a mutual and early cessation of hostilities we also hope for the resumption of a dialogue for Europe for a durable resolution of the conflict based on the principles of the U.N Charter and past agreements and bearing in mind the legitimate security interests of all states I thank you Mr President I thank the distinguished representative of Pakistan distinguished delegates We Have Heard the Last speaker in exponential vote after vote in exercise of the right of reply has been requested may I remind members that statements in the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes for the second intervention and should be made by delegations from their seats I call on the representative of the democratic People's Republic of Korea thank you Mr chair Mr President by delegation takes the flow to exercise the right of reply in response to the provocative statement made by South Korea yesterday we categorically rejected South Korea's outrageous Outpost which merits no comment however now that South Korea provoked us let me make a few worse we reiterate that we have never recognized the unlawful U.S Security Council sanctions resolution against the dprk which was cooked up by the United States and its a vessel forces we once again make clear that we haven't never had any arms dealings with Russia and that we have no plan to do so in the future either South Korea's Reckless remark is intolerable as it is totally aimed at trying to tarnish the image of the dprk by fabricating on non-existent staff it is also a grave provocation that triggers contraction clearly speaking at the United States not infringed upon the Justice security interests of Russia and accelerated the Eastward advance of NATO step by step the present situation of Ukraine would not have been created at the present the U.S and other Western countries are wrecking the global peace and the regional security while handing over military hardware to Ukraine to the value of an astronomical sum of money in total disregard of Russia's security concerns we'd like to draw the attention of the member stage to the fact that in January the NATO Secretary General flew to South Korea to put pressure on the latter for its passive Military Support to Ukraine it is also an Open Secret that South Korea is seeking to supply ammunitions and weaponry to Ukraine in the face of the mounting pressure from the United States it is a matter of time that military hardware of South Korea will turn up in the battlefields in Ukraine South Korea's allegation is aimed at distracting the attention of the International Community from its criminal record we have already made clear that we will not deal with the South Korea South Korea should be well aware that if he continues to provoke costs groundlessly it will face extreme security crisis far from diffusing as a security and engineers taking this opportunity we stress that the previous two Russian people have the will and capability to defend the security and territorial Integrity of the country without any outside Military Support I thank you Mr President I call on the representative of India thank you Mr President Mr President I am taking the floor today to say that India chooses this time not to respond to Pakistan's mischievous provocations are advised to the delegate of Pakistan is to refer to our numerous rights of reply that we have exercised in the past Pakistan has only to look at itself and its own track record as a state that harbors and provides safe havens to terrorists and does so with impunity such uncalled for provocation is particularly regrettable and certainly misplaced at a time when after two days of intense discussions we have all agreed that the part of Peace can be the only path forward to resolve conflict and Discord I thank you thank you I call on the representative of Pakistan thank you Mr President for giving me the floor any exercise of my right of reply we would like to make the following points India continues to perpetrate a factually incorrect position on this forum year after year Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognized disputed territory and not an integral part of India as it has been claimed repeating a wrong position would not make it acceptable at any point the focus of today's debate is on people another crisis that we face at hand and one of the alienable rights of the people enshrined in the very first article of the charter is the right of self-determination in the case of kashmiri people the right to self-determination has been recognized and promised to them by the U.N security Council through its resolutions for over seven decades India has prevented the kashmiris through force and fraud from exercising this right and holding the U.N supervised plebiscite to enable the kashmiris to determine their destiny India has imprisoned the entire kashmiri leadership illegally detained thousands of kashmiri youths including women and children summarily executed young boys put down protests violently and burnt down entire neighborhoods and villages Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir Remains the most militarized Zone in the world where close to 900 000 security forces have been deployed by India to curb the legitimate struggle of the kashmiri people but such measures only serve to intensify the struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for the right to serve determination even in the face of worst atrocities as evident from thousands of unknown unmarked Mass graves in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir the innocent people of Jammu and Kashmir remained firm in their claim for their right to serve determination Pakistan will keep exposing Indian brutalities and inform the International Community of the plight of the kashmiri people I thank you Mr President I call on the representative of the Republic of Korea thank you Mr President my delegation applied for a light of reply to make a fair commands about DPR casing marks let me be short but very clear We Believe each statement distracted our very reason why all of us are here together it is about our desire for international peace and stability it is about our respect for justice and international law and it is about our commitment to the core principles and values of the United United Nations Charter my delegation believes all the representatives here know who is violating its duties under the U.N Charter and international law needless to say it is the perk we also like to truly affirm that any Arts trade without eprk constitutes a blatant violation of the U.N security Council resolutions I thank you Mr President I call on the representative of the democratic People's Republic of Korea for the second intervention thank you Mr President for giving me the floor again my delegation is compared to take the flow to exercise the second row of the right right of reply in response to the statement by South Korea we are not going to reiterate our position but we take these opportunities to strongly condemn South Korea's attempt to Insight in freightly cider confrontation in this August forum and with condemning the strongest terms that the Security Council is being transformed into a tool for implementing the Hostile policy of the United States and South Korea and other vessel forces without mentioning a single word about the United States and South Korea joined military exercises now taking place in and around the Korean Peninsula which is seriously encroached upon the security interests of the dprk we seriously want South Korea that if it continues to come up with the business accusations in Hot Pursuit Of yes or hostile policy against the dprk it will inevitably face greater secret disaster South Korea must appear in mind that continued submission to the United States will lead to the self-destruction I thank you Mr President thank you in accordance with the terms of paragraph 11 of the resolution just adapted the 11th emergency special session of the general assembly is temporary adjourned this meeting is adjourned foreign
vD_NOzw_8r8,Will spending cuts erode military power? The UK may offer some insights,"In 2023, a U.S. general noted that decades of military spending cuts in the United Kingdom had affected its war-fighting capabilities. The same concerns about the state of the British forces were also flagged by the then-head of the U.S. army in 2015.

Cuts in military spending aren’t unique to the U.K. For decades, military spending worldwide has decreased due to decades of “peace dividends” after the end of World War II.

Even defense spending in the U.S., as a percentage of its economic output, is at historic lows, from around 9% of its GDP in 1960 to 3.5% in 2021. 

In between recessions and rising cost pressures to fund social spending, military budgets were easy targets for cuts. But when economies recovered, military budgets did not increase in tandem.

An analysis of military spending since World War II noted that “military budgets require more time to recover from an economic downturn than to benefit from economic growth.” 

Since Russian troops poured into Ukraine, and China has asserted itself more forcefully in Asia, European countries have announced a ramp up of their military spending.

Are there lessons other countries can learn from the United Kingdom when it comes to budgeting for defense?

Watch the video above to learn about the factors affecting defense budgets and why military spending is rising so slowly.

https://twitter.com/CNBCi",1,"Following World War One and the economic shock
of The Great Depression in the 1930s, military spending among European nations was reduced. The spending cuts would later expose the gulf
in military might between Nazi Germany and the allies, which were forced to rapidly 
ramp up defense spending. Decades of relative peace followed after the end 
of World War Two, and with it, military spending fell. In 2006, NATO members agreed to spend 
2% of their GDP on defense. This pledge was renewed in 2014, 
when Russia annexed Crimea. As of 2022, only 9 countries out of 30 members
had fulfilled that promise. Even defense spending in the U.S., as a percentage
of its economic output, is at historic lows. From 9% of its GDP in 1960, military expenditure
in the country is now equivalent to 3.5%, which still totaled over $800 billion in 2021. Since Russian troops poured into Ukraine 
and China asserted itself more forcefully in Asia, European countries have announced
a ramp up of their military spending. The UK’s military forces must be geared
primarily in Europe, including against that threat from Russia, we want some global capability. But that's less important than making sure
we're ready for war in Europe. If we don't stop the Russians in Ukraine, we'll have 
to stop them in the Baltic States or in Poland. And that means a large, whole scale
conflagration between NATO and Russia. And nobody really wants that. With the escalation in Ukraine at the moment,
I'm really worried that we risk spiraling into a global war, even a nuclear war. But are these spending increases too little
too late to bolster the defense of Europe, and are they sufficient as a deterrent? This is the Ajax. The project for the state-of-the-art armored
vehicle was launched in 2010, with 589 units planned to enter service with 
the British army in 2017. However, only 26 Ajax vehicles were delivered
by the end of 2021. As the Ajax program progressed, it was found
to have numerous safety and technical issues. These included excessive noise and vibration
that led to injuries, sections with inconsistent lengths, and problems with reversing. But arguably, its biggest problem is its rising cost. In 2014, the UK government signed a £5.5 billion contract 
with U.S. defense contractor General Dynamics to make the armored vehicle, 
but the project is expected to cost the taxpayer more than £10 billion, 
double the original budget.  The Ajax is a very good example where a lot
of mistakes were made early on in the project. The Minister of Defense does not have a good
record at managing these large complex programs. All of those very large acquisition projects,
they tend to be very complex, because they involve a wide variety of different stakeholders,
they also involve, often, cutting-edge technology. And therefore, there is often a lot of risk,
and in some ways, that management of risk is difficult to do. So, if the development of new military equipment
is challenging, how is that investment mapped out? Factors determining defense budgets include
the international threat environment, relative spending of rivals, global economic
conditions and geography. Defense budgets are also affected by electoral
cycles, forms of government, public opinion, civilian-military relations, 
and domestic economic conditions too. The difficulties surrounding the Ajax armored
vehicles are not uncommon. In fact, project cost overruns and delays
are frequent in the defense sector. A study of 95 weapons system programs by the
U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2008 found that budgets overran by an average of 26 percent 
in 2007 and had average delays of 21 months. Procurement means that strategies and the
need for equipment must be considered well in advance of operations. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014,
should spending have been increased earlier? Over the past, perhaps the threat environment
was understood differently. We had a time when obviously, we were active
in Afghanistan and Iraq, where some of the major threats were more in relation to violent
extremism and terrorism and state-based threats like we are facing in Ukraine at the moment
perhaps haven't been prioritized as much. After September 11 for instance, the focus
of defense spending moved away from conventional warfare to the increasing threat of terror attacks. And in 2021, a shift in the defense strategy
meant real cuts to the British Army to favor investment in cyber warfare. The British army is just not fit for purpose. It's certainly not fit for the purpose 
of large-scale mechanized warfare. If the British Army had been one of the parties
to this at war in Ukraine, it would have run out of artillery shells, within a matter of days. Far too many of our military systems come
into service years late, or way over their original budget, or both. We now have a barbaric invasion and a brutal war
on the European continental landmass, only several hundred miles
from our own shores. I don't think we could ignore that. So I think we need, A, to increase the amount
of money that we spend on defense. But B, we also need to spend the money that
we do have much more effectively. Yet, the UK had the fourth biggest military
expenditure worldwide in 2021. So how is that money being invested? According to a 10-year equipment plan 
by the UK’s defense ministry in 2022, the biggest investment for the next decade was attributed
to the Defense Nuclear Organization, which oversees the country’s nuclear deterrent
such as submarines and Trident missiles. Even though the Army and Air Force would see
their budgets cut, the British government spending watchdog noted that the report was
based on “optimistic assumptions” and failed to reflect ""significant and
growing cost pressures.” Defense budgets are, ultimately, a product
of political institutions, and will be impacted by domestic politics, the relationship between
the Ministry of Defense and the Treasury, and fiscal pressures, like
other government departments. Ultimately, the kind of broader focus that will
shape how much defense will spend or wants to spend is always going to be determined
by that strategic understanding of what are the threats that we're likely to face, whilst
also fighting for your little part of the budget which you need to constantly justify
because it is obviously public money. There is a need for UK Ministry of Defense, 
the armed forces as well as the defense industry, to have that kind of open dialogue with the public 
to explain a bit, ""What is it that defense does?"" But according to market research firm Ipsos,
six months after the start of Russia’s war on Ukraine, only a third of British adults
thought that government spending on defense should be increased, while 18% felt 
that spending should be reduced. When it comes to defense, if we think about
what makes people secure, we think about enough to eat, a decent wage, a sense
of community, healthcare, education. and reducing security to a question of how big your government's army is, devalues that whole notion. While most European governments have now 
increased their defense budgets, how much investment is enough
for a country to be secure?  After decades of “peace dividends” following
World War Two and the Cold War, government coffers were
prioritized for the welfare state. In between recessions and rising
cost pressures to fund social spending, military budgets were easy targets for cuts.  But when economies recovered, military budgets
did not increase in tandem. An analysis of military spending since 
World War Two noted that “military budgets require more time to recover from an economic downturn
than to benefit from economic growth”. The immediate pressure on our defense budget
is the level of inflation for defense is much higher than was anticipated. So, in real terms, we’re to see a reduction in our 
defense budget over the next couple of years. It's hard to see a way in which the UK could
significantly raise proportion of its GDP spent on defense to 2.5%, never mind to 3%,
without also agreeing to a significant rise and in general taxation. Raising it even higher will divert resources
away from other things that are vitally needed, tackling poverty, tackling the crisis in the
National Health Service, providing humanitarian aid overseas, supporting refugees coming from
Ukraine, and it can only add to fueling military tension around the world. We are moving into more of an era of strategic
competition, whether that's with the emergence of China, particularly in the Indo-Pacific
and sort of regional influence and dominance. It is very much a question of, how do we understand
the strategic environment and what does our response need to be? Whether today’s military spending decisions
provide value for money won’t only be judged right now, but also in the decades to come. The decisions that you make today are very
much going to influence what you're going to be operating in the next
20, 30, even 40 years. For example, what kind of fuels
are we going to use? Some of these decisions we need to make
today are already having to consider much, much broader future focused implications."

the beginning he's counting on us not sticking together he was counting on inability to keep NATO United is counting us not to be able to bring in others on the side of Ukraine he thought he could Outlast us I don't think he's thinking that right now God knows what he's thinking I don't think he's thinking that but he's just been plain wrong plain wrong and one year later the evidence is right here in this room we stand here together Mr President I'm delighted to be able to repay your visit to our country in Washington not long ago you told us you told the Congress quote we have no fear nor should anyone in the world have it end of quote you and all ukrainians Mr President remind the world every single day with the meaning of the word courage is all sectors of your economy all walks into all life astounding astounding remind us that freedom is priceless it's worth fighting for as long as it takes and that's how long we're going to be with you Mr President for as long as it takes we'll do it thank you and if you're just joining us we've been listening to a press conference with the U.S President Joe Biden who has made a surprise visit to Kiev the Ukrainian capital in his remarks together with Ukrainian President zielinski Biden reiterated his ongoing support for Ukraine and outlined some of the additional military and financial support the United States would be providing to Ukraine including further military hardware as well as introducing additional sanctions against individuals and entities that have been avoiding already existing sanctions on Russia to prevent further financing of Russia's war against Ukraine the U.S president also spoke about the unity that is ongoing and steadfast for Ukraine despite Russia's expectation that there would not be this kind of unity among Western countries and among Nato one year later our correspondent in kieva Ibrahim is standing by for us and she joins us with some more about this unannounced visit by U.S President Biden to Kiev Aya what more can you tell us about Biden's visit today well there was a you know a huge reaffirmation for the United States commitment to Ukraine's uh war effort for its um for its effort to defend uh its land and its territory uh President Biden has um promised new high Mars these uh these rocket launchers that are very uh that have really helped Ukraine uh maintain the position that it has more javelins but in addition to uh the the weapons there's there are also Promises of a new sanctions package that would further Target Russian uh Elite and what he said is that the United States is is with Ukraine for the Long Haul and this is a message of course for the Ukrainian people I imagine that it would be a huge morale boost for the citizens of this country and the city to have the United States the president of the United States visit them as the country is under attack and to come here and to reaffirm this commitment but also it's a message for the American people that they are also in this commitment for the Long Haul as the president said for as long as it takes and of course um before prior to that speech that he had given there had been a visit to a memorial of uh Ukrainian soldiers that I believe had died you know nine years ago when the war first started um in the east in 2014 so that is also hugely symbolic for President Biden to go pay his respects um and for him it's kind of an implicit recognition that this aggression started not just a year ago but in fact in 2014 nine years ago and we were hearing earlier that as President Biden was walking through the streets of Kiev there were even arid Sirens underway what kind of security measures could Ukrainian officials Implement ahead of the visit by the leader of the United States well as you may imagine Mariana because of how sensitive this visit is and because of how sensitive the security Arrangement around it officials have been tight-lipped I mean we didn't really have any confirmation of President Biden even being in the country until we saw him in in in videos and recordings on social media visiting that Memorial with with President zielinski so we do know very very very little oftentimes official confirmations of such visits even after the world has seen them uh on screens won't come until the visit is over that is totally a normal uh part of these visits but since yesterday as rumors started that some high-ranking officials will be visiting the Ukrainian Capital streets here in this Center have been blocked much to the frustrations of some residents in the morning actually because traffic was quite difficult we also know that uh you know cell phone networks have been disabled in certain parts of the city to make sure that the situation is secure enough but it is very very risky as you mentioned we're actually right now still in an active Airway alert and what that means is that actually everybody right now should be in a shelter because there is a danger of Russian strikes but Ukrainian air defense system have been effective and so far there have not been any hits in the capital today that was the W's Ibrahim on the ground for us in the Ukrainian Capital key of Aya thank you so much for your reporting well we can now bring in DW's Chief International editor Richard Walker Richard the timing of this visit by the U.S president two Kiev is of course very significant can you tell us about that yeah Mariana um I mean this is a week where really uh you've got an awful lot of movement around the Ukraine war around Russia's Invasion as we approach the first anniversary of that Invasion coming up on Friday we've just had here in Germany the Munich security conference so this major Gathering of political and military leaders from all over the world to talk about International Security obviously the the war in Ukraine absolutely dominated the agenda there there were interesting interjections important important speeches by for instance China's top Diplomat taking place there also the US vice president Kamala Harris was there um pledging American support the kind of things that we just heard from from Joe Biden they were also heard from European leaders so there was an effort among transatlantic leaders to to give a real strong message of unity there but the Chinese uh top Diplomat speech made it very clear that China has a very different View on what's going on then today it's not just Joe Biden in Kiev today also we're expecting Wang Yi China's top Diplomat to be in Moscow today so talks going on there between the Chinese and the Russians there's an expectation that the Chinese are going to be bringing out a peace proposal when he was floating that in Munich we don't know the details of that but that is going to be certainly a very important uh thing for everybody to look at and a lot of uncertainty about how China will position that given its implicit support for Russia so far through through this war then later this week we have the anniversary itself on Friday there'll be meetings at the United Nations around that possibly further votes to try and test international support for Ukraine um on Friday then also Germany's chancellor olav Schultz heading to India next weekend we've just had that confirmed from the Indian side the German side hasn't confirmed that yet but we're very much expecting that trip to happen and Schultz will certainly be trying to get the Indians to move closer to the Western on this wall so so much diplomatic activity around this very important sort of Milestone a really quite awful Milestone of course if you think about it this war has dragged on for a whole year um but yeah the message coming from many that it could drag on for much longer so we just heard from Joe Biden there saying that the US is in this for the Long Haul Richard let's talk about this visit by China's top Diplomat to Moscow that you mentioned this visit is coming on the heels of warnings by the U.S Secretary of State Anthony blinken that China could be considering sending lethal assistance to Russia for its war against Ukraine how real of a concern is this and is this topic likely to come up in the talks between China and Russia in Moscow well certainly I mean the the this peace plan that the Chinese have announced uh certainly we can expect the Chinese and the Russian sides to be to be discussing that we'll see whether wagy and the Russian side say anything in public to today about that but of course these these allegations coming from Tony blinken from the U.S Secretary of State uh just yesterday after this Munich security conference that we were just talking about there certainly hitting the headlines I mean so far China's support for Russia has been pretty much diplomatic so it has not you know for instance in votes in the United Nations it is not sided with the West it's tried to uh put on a sort of a you know an appearance of being neutral but very much in terms of its rhetoric um and in terms of yeah if you really look at what the Chinese are saying you can see that their sympathies lie very much uh with Russia but it would absolutely be a very different thing if they then started providing um Military Support um blinking this warning from blinking at the very least I think we should interpret it as a kind of a boarding shot across China's barrels not to go down that road but as I just said there are an awful lot of balls in the air right now if China is going to be coming up with this peace plan we need to look at what's in it and there's word that what it may include um is saying that no weapons should be sent into this conflict that there should be a freeze on supply of weapons for instance to Ukraine so we'll have to see whether China is using a Potential Threat to provide weapons to Russia as a kind of Leverage behind that peace proposal to try to put the Western powers on the spot and tell them okay don't start don't send any more weapons into Ukraine otherwise we're going to be starting sending weapons to to uh to Russia we don't know if that's a background but that is a conceivable element to this peace plan so it really I think it's going to be very very interesting to see what is in that peace proposal when it comes out we're anticipating it later in the week we'll have to see um but yeah this whole situation moving very fast but I think one thing that if you stand back was very very clear from the Munich security conference I think we'll see it from all of these different sort of diplomatic Maneuvers that are going on during the course of this week the world is really very divided on this at the moment you've got the United States and the West pretty much United within itself but China and Russia are looking very aligned with each other and the rest of the world countries like India key countries like that like India Brazil South Africa trying to stay as far as they possibly can still on the fence Richard you mentioned that the West is very United in its support for Ukraine and that's certainly something that U.S President Joe Biden spoke about just a short time ago in that press conference in Kiev about how you know a year later they're still steadfast and support for Ukraine they're going to be supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes until Russia is pushed out of the country is is defeated Ukraine must win and so on and so forth and yet there have been some voices within the United States who are perhaps not as enthusiastic about when it comes to support for Ukraine do you see indications that this kind of unity this kind of steadfast support in the U.S could be weakening well I mean certainly the big picture is that the West is very United but within that picture there are of course discrepancies there have been a lot of you know there's there's been quite a lot of argument for instance within Europe about how fast to provide certain weapon systems uh to Ukraine Germany for instance was criticized for taking uh a long time to decide to send tanks in uh you tend to have the Baltic states really pushing for for moving very fast countries like France and Germany being being a bit more cautious um and within the United States you're right there's been a you know a lot of bipartisan consent bipartisan consensus broadly um on the war so far and there was a huge bipartisan delegation from Congress in Munich for the conference we were just talking about but there is a minority within the Republican party that has been really questioning the merits of all of this and it tends to be from the sort of trumpist sort of America First Wing sort of isolationist sort of tendency within the Republican party which I was speaking to one member a one member of Congress for instance in Munich who tried to play it down and said like the the broad majority of both parties is very much on board but it does add a further complication to to the debate within the United States about taking this forward adding to that the fact that we have presidential politics increasingly coming onto the Horizon with the election coming up the end of next year primary battles in between now and then in the Republican party that could bring out some of these issues and divisions to the fore within the Republican party so a lot depends on how the presidential race goes within the Republican Party obviously we don't even have Yet full confirmation from Joe Biden whether he wants to run again we're expecting that so there is uncertainty in the air within the US political situation overall but still for now a very significant I think bipartisan majority in favor of this strong line supporting Ukraine for National editor Richard Walker Richard thank you so much for your insights

#newstart #putin #nuclearpower",1,Russia is suspending its last major nuclear disarmament treaty with the United States President Vladimir Putin announced the move during an address to the nation the new start treaty commits Russia and the United States to limiting their stockpile of nuclear warheads they came into force in 2011 and was due to expire in 2026. Putin also warned Washington that if the U.S presumes nuclear tests Russia will do the same his audience of lawmakers greeted the statement with Applause [Applause] I repeat Russia is not withdrawing from the treaty no it is suspending its participation but before returning to the discussion of this issue we should understand for ourselves what such countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance like France and Great Britain claim and how we will take into account their strategic arsenals that is the alliance's combined strike potential so what Alliance earlier our correspondent Yuri rashetto Enrique told me what Russia's suspension of the new start treaty means well the purpose of this treated clear is to reduce nuclear weapons it's the only remaining element of the nuclear arms control treaty system between the United States and Russia and in the two countries hold together about 90 percent of the world's nuclear warheads which is pretty much so we should be pretty worried about the suspension as the treaty provides for Mutual inspections on nuclear facilities on each other's territory so that each side can make sure that the other side doesn't deploy more nuclear warheads than agreed a month ago the United States already accused Rush of refusing to assist the US in those inspections Moscow threatened to withdraw from the treaty in 2026 completely and now the suspension comes Putin explained the step by saying that United States the United States would be developing allegedly new types of nuclear weapons in Russia should be ready to conduct nuclear tests now tell us Yuri more broadly about Putin's speech this is his annual state of the union but obviously this year taking place under exceptional circumstances what were some of the other major themes well um the more arms Western Ukraine is supplied by the West he said the further Russia would push those arms back away from the Russian border that was probably an indication that Russia might try to Annex more Ukrainian territories in his speech and any case in any case this was a warning to Ukraine and a warning to the West first of all to the United States by the way just an hour after Putin's speech the Russian foreign Ministry Simon U.S ambassador to Moscow and expressed the Diplomatic protest because of the growing involvement of the United States in the hostilities on the side of Ukraine it's a state in a statement basically it's the old Russian way to reverse all accusations made against Russia and to accuse the West on the same of the same and put in speech was an attempt to convince the world that the danger doesn't come from Russia but from the West for Russia now he is speaking to a domestic audience there what kind of support does he have almost a year since Russia's invasion of Ukraine well look many uh maybe most people in Russia have long since given up the attitude to protest uh most say it doesn't matter what's happening uh in Ukraine what's going on there unless it's immobilization affects them personally that we put in knows that and that's why the second part of his speech the the larger one was about the social policy of his government also he said that presidential elections will be held in 2024 so next year in accordance with the Russian law so is his speech today earlier the Russian president clearly wanted to be seen not only as the president of War but rather as a president of Peace which is logical if you keep in mind he's ambitious to run for the president's next year one more time well thank you so much for that update that's a DW's Yuri rashetto Enrique Lavia really appreciate it well NATO Secretary General Jen stoltenberg is urging Russia to reconsider suspending its participation in the new start treaty sultanburg has been meeting Ukraine's foreign minister dimitro kulaba and the EU foreign policy Chief Joseph Burrell at NATO headquarters in Brussels and stoltenberg gave a stark warning over the possible consequences of the kremlin's move more nuclear weapons and less Arms Control makes the world more dangerous and that's the reason why in NATO we have worked so hard to engage Russia on issues related to Arms Control and why NATO allies have supported the new start and also why I'm calling on Russia Today to reconsider its decision to suspend its participation in the new start agreement we have to remember that this is one of the last major Arms Control agreements we have after Russia started to violate the agreement that banned all the intermediate range weapons the INF treaty that led to the demise of that treaty a few years ago now they are suspending the other big nuclear arms control treaty the new start which regulates limits on the total number of long-range strategic weapons I'm now very pleased to welcome John J Sullivan until last September he served as U.S ambassador to Russia and was previously U.S Deputy deputy secretary of state welcome sir thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us we had this major announcement in that speech that Putin is suspending Russia's participation in the new Star treaty in your view how worried should we be here well thank you Claire it's great uh great to be with you this is a regrettable and irresponsible move by the Russian government but it's something that they had already signaled they had already in effect suspended participating in the treaty some time ago by declining requests that the U.S made for inspections which we which the United States is entitled to have under the treaty it's not something that Russia gives us it's something we're entitled to under the treaty they've also refused to meet in this group called a bilateral consultative group established by the treaty where both sides are supposed to talk about issues under the treaty they've declined uh to allow inspections or to meet and discuss the treaty they had already suspended participation what I think significant clear is uh Putin went further than that he said he wants to know what Great Britain and France are doing uh before he resumes participation in the treaty this is a signal that he is going to withdraw in my opinion because the this new star treaty is a treaty between the United States and Russia only this is the end of an era for arms control in that sense potentially it's what he's signaling and why is he signaling this because his war in Ukraine is going so disastrously wrong for him this is more nuclear blackmail nuclear saber rattling by the Russian government by President Putin he's done it before uh this is he's not taking the final step now in withdrawing from the treaty but he's signaling that he's going to do it now blinken has left the door open to restarting negotiations at any time do you think there's anything the U.S could have done differently to keep this treaty alive or um is this a reason for the U.S to change its nuclear posture well uh Claire we've been uh we've been engaged with the Russians uh to try to get uh this treaty reinvigorated to get inspections underway to meet in the uh the treaty established process to uh discuss issues that may arise under the treaty and the Russians have simply refused and their excuses nothing to do with the treaty itself with the deputy foreign minister said some weeks ago was because the United States is so hostile to Russia in connection with Ukraine Russia isn't going to participate in the new Star treaty well what does that say about their attitude even at the depths of the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union continue to have discussions on arms control agreements what Putin's saying now is given what's happened in Ukraine to my special military operation if this continues to go downhill uh the new Star treaty and maybe others uh you know other actions by me are going to be going to be coming now you stayed in Moscow after the invasion of Ukraine and all the way up until September 2022. what changes Did You observe in Russian Society since the invasion of Ukraine well there was a certain amount of fatalism among the Russians that I engaged with many were afraid to discuss their true feelings about what was happening because the Russian government has been uh engaged in an enormous Crackdown on uh Independent Media ngos and so forth I think a lot of people are afraid to speak their minds but but Claire I'm afraid to say there are a lot of Russians who over years being fed Russian disinformation are prepared to believe uh the absolutely untrue statements by Putin today that somehow the war that he launched in Ukraine was actually a law a war launched by the United States and our allies and partners I mean it turns truth on its head it would make George Orwell blush you know the the types of misstatements that he's he's making but unfortunately the Russian government has been engaged in a disinformation campaign directed at its own people such that they are prepared to believe many Russians are prepared to believe the untruths that President Putin is speaking today now I also want to ask you as we look at the prospect of a grinding War of Attrition in Ukraine what is your view on how and when negotiations between Ukraine and Russia might be possible is there a scenario in which they could be productive Claire given my experience before the war started uh my involvement with the U.S government and our efforts to negotiate with the Russians to stop the war before it started I can tell you from my experience and all I've seen since it began the Russian government has no interest in good faith negotiations with anyone over Ukraine President Putin is dead set on achieving the goals of his special military operation he doesn't want an off-ramp he doesn't want a good faith negotiation she wants Surrender by Ukraine which is what they say would be the cost of negotiation so I don't see a willing interlocutor on the other side Claire who would engage in negotiations at this point only when Putin thought that he could not achieve the goals of the special military operation which are where they repeated very often to de-notsify and demilitarize Ukraine which I interpret as removing the democratically elected government in Kiev and subjugating the people of Ukraine only when he really believes he can't accomplish that would he engage in negotiations and he believes he can accomplish those goals today thank you sir so much for sharing your Insight I'm afraid we're running out of time and have to leave it there but I want to thank you again for taking the time to speak with us on DW news that's former U.S ambassador to Russia John J Sullivan
XGF3GEN4UGw,Live: Shanghai's first metro line crossing Yangtze River under construction,"Construction is underway for Shanghai Metro's Chongming Line, which will connect Pudong New Area and Chongming Island, China's third largest island. This would be Shanghai's first metro line to cross the Yangtze River. The construction project involves the use of two giant shield machines to drive through tunnels under the river. Follow CGTN's Wu Bin to go 30 meters under the ground and see the project's progress. #KickStart2023",1,foreign hello everyone greetings to viewers of cgt of cgtn around the world this is cgt live streaming uh today we are going to explore Shanghai Subway the newest line of Shanghai Subway so as we know Subway has become indispensable for our everyday life especially in big cities like Shanghai and Shanghai now has 20 Subway Lines and now they are going to adding more uh one new line to connecting shanghai's men District district to put a new area to its uh Chong Ming island in the Northeast part of the city uh you know the Tomi island is also China's third largest island so today we are going to visit the construction site the construction is now in a phase of Excavating tunnels under the Yancey River and today we're going to explore the construction site and first of all I'm now in the command center of the construction project and and first of all let's go check a how to give you a brief understanding of the Charming line this project and here they have a exhibition Honda we are going to tell you something about the charminglan uh through a map so here is a map of the project of toming live I'm gonna open the lighting here so this is uh the area of toming District director for some of our audience overseas probably you have only heard of pushi and pudong that's the major District of Shanghai but Shanghai is extremely big they also have an island in the Northeast part of the city so this this part is Chong Ming Island and this part is another island called changing Island so these and here they also have a have a have a island here so these three islands are choming district of Shanghai and for changing Island it has over 40 000 residents and for chhoming Island the China's third largest island it has over 600 000 people living on the island so the we see the red lines here this is the Metrolina of toming so the chomingland will start from here which is located in the Northeast part of a Pudo new district and then cross Yangtze River to changing island in the middle of the ANSI River and then connecting Charming Island here so it is very important to all those 600 000 people living in Charming District because it's because much more convenient in the past they only if they want to go to Major District of Shanghai they have to travel by private cars or taxis or buses or ferries but but after the lawn is constructed it'll be much more convenient for them to go to Pudo new area of Shanghai and today I'm also pleased to be joined by John Hong Fong he is the Deputy general manager of the tominglan project to welcome welcome Mr John for joining cgtms hello so just now I was telling our audience about the basic information of toming district and how it and why it is important for the residents here so I would like to ask one more question because this is the first metro line of Shanghai to Cross yansi River so what are some of the difficulties uh Suzette so I'm gonna go down now um so one of the difficulties of constructing this metro line is the the width of the Johnson River this is the longest tunnel they are built by a Subway tunnel of the metro line in China this area has a span of over seven kilometers and this area has an a span of over nine kilometers so this is the longest and they are using a mega Shield tunneling machine that has a diameter of 13.5 meters to construct the tunnels and the second difficulty is about because the the width of the Johnson River so it's gonna have more pressure when constructing uh the uh reconstructing the lines so that also brings uh more dangers to the safety requirement of this project and also what's lying in the bed of the river is also posing another threat to the construction anyway it's uh so constructing uh it sounds uh it sounds like a very complex and uh complicated uh work so one of the uh major tools we're using to construct the tunnel is the Mega Shield tunneling machine so I've seen the model here so is this the mega Shield machine we are talking about foreign so the shield machine now what we are seeing the the rotating part is the cutter heads it has a diameter of 13.5 meters and the entire tunneling machine is uh over 140 meters long and weighs about uh 3500 tons so so the shield machine so in Chinese it's called so I would like to talk about why it is called so what is the word do it means and what is the word go means because English is a shield machine Shield means do it so why in Chinese it's in your understanding it's called um foreign that is actually protecting from the mud and the water from entering the machine and go means construct in Chinese which is constructing the tunnels so the entire machine is called uh in Chinese it's called dungoji which sort of explained how it works by uh constructing the tunnels and also on the other hand preventing from mud and other waste from entering the machine so this model uh so can you tell us something more about this model because we are going to see the construction site after a while so is this the same as we're going to explore the woman um so in a while we are going to go 30 meters underground from here this is the tail of the of the shield machine we are going to go underground from here and then enter from here right and then we are uh um so in a while we are going to enter from here and then walk through the machine and then towards the head of the the machine I'm seeing something that has a lighting here the the green light and the yellow red yellow light tubes so you know [Music] so these two tubes the uh the green one is the tubes the sentence slurries to help the the cutter has to cut uh the the Earth's and the red one the yellow one is those ascending all the waste out so why it is important to send slurries to in in Excavating tunnels Okay so now we are going to to the head of the shield machine to explain why it is important to uh to sentence using a very uh very a smart manner for us to understand I think that helps me understand uh so this is the cutter heads you can imagine it as the human tooth so all the black dots there are human to human teeth and they are cutting the Earth and rocks under the underground and it's very hard for if if the Rock and Earth is too uh it it it it is is is too uh hard so the slurry their function is to sort of like a Waters or milk or uh to to soften those materials soften those rocks and Earths and then easier for you to digest and then send them out um so the shield machine also protects a very important thing for the shield machine is to protect all the waste rocks and Earths from entering inside of the machine so that this way protecting the safety of of the staffs there so uh Mr Zhang I have another question where we're talking about the model because in here uh I've seen things are moving so can you explain this to us so how why it is uh moving here and what's the functions so these are lifting Jacks many lifting Jacks so they are actually forcing the head of the shield machine to moving forward to Excavating tunnels in a while we are going to uh the construction site to see how this part works we are going to have a more uh you know real experience of of this machine so now just Mr Zhang said just talking about the model here may sound uh not theoretical so we are now going to explore uh by entering the construction site let's go uh so here I've it's a monitoring system right [Music] it's actually a digital platform of a control system and by sitting in the office the staff here can control the the operation of the uh of constructing the tunnels and I've also seen some of the figures there so what Canon shows uh when sitting in the office it will show how many staffs are there how many materials and also the face of the entire operation so all kinds of uh statistics and data will be shown on the screen to help you help them to analyze the current situation and now um it's sort of like a tunnel um so this is a imitation of a real tunnel and uh so this tunnel is a it's not not the real one so I think our audience would like to see the real tunnel in a while so now we're we're going to the Rio tunnel um to explore more about this project foreign all the latest Technologies and all these Awards they have received and uh so over there I would like our cameraman to see over there the is the construction site of the tunnel and we are going to enter the tunnel now so Mr John so when I'm wondering because this project is seems to be very important to conducting uh Charming Island to the major districts of Shanghai so when is the line started at the end of 2019 and now we are going to enter the construction site [Music] and we are going we have to wear a safety hat ERS I'm not seeing any uh okay so what are this foreign a transportation system they are building so they will uh transport the materials for building the tunnel wall and also the touchological uh [Music] and the blue tubes we are seeing right now are the tubes uh for sending sending out uh slurries and now uh for our audience we are going to go 30 meters underground to have a real experience to go near the shield machine to have a to have a look and it's going to take us a while so I would like to show you some of the pictures and images of the construction site uh when when they started since 2019 let's take a look [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign and today we are at the construction site of shanghai's children in the first part of our live streaming today we are in the exhibition Hall to give you a brief understanding of how this uh how the where does the Tommy line connects and how the tunnel is built by a mega Shield machine that has a diameter of 13.5 meters and now we are at 30 meters underground behind me is the tunnel and we are going to explore the tunnel and also we are going to enter the mega Shield machine to see how everything works foreign [Music] so this is a uh the the tunnel this part of the tunnel is almost built but uh they still need a lot a lot of preparation before everything is done they have uh need to need to have a wall in the middle and then uh have also other safety works for like for example to help the tunnel to Evacuate the smogs and other other things and on the both sides of the tunnel we've seen uh tube standing us without buildings so can you explain us so what are these tubes for um so these tubes are like supporting system of the of the of the construction of the tunnel so these three tubes they are they are tubes for scenting waters for sending out Waters and also for sending out the stewardess what about these two tubes these two would be thicker than the than those three numbers [Music] so these two tubes the blue one the green one they are the tubes we are seeing in the model uh the the tubes with with different colors of Lights one is for sending in slurries and the other one is to sending out uh slurries combined with with wastes of Earth and rocks to the ground and also I I know it's a very complicated work for constructing the tunnels and also and after you dig in the tunnels it's very important to construct the walls to support the tunnels three dollars so these uh tunnel walls are built of a circle is called of nine pieces and they are and they use very uh hard materials to strengthen the tunnel and as we hear the sound of the constructing site we are very near to the shield machine so the sun there says Shinto welcomes you so this means that you are going to enter the shield machine so how long has The Shield machine activated the tunnel have we under the Yangtze River [Music] okay so it's still going to take us two months before the shield machine enters under the youngster River thank you guys tonight okay so the shield machine is consists of five parts we are now entering the tail of the shield machine as we move along we are going to very near to the head of the shield machine foreign so the yellow one is the transportation system inside the shield machine they are going to uh they are going to transport the materials for making the ground here for making the ground so it will serve as the railways in the future as a field one and it's quite narrow here watch out [Music] foreign [Music] how many stations are there for the entire time so there are eight stations together [Music] so yeah so these are the pieces for strength and the tunnel wall for making the tunnel wall and they are connected by by these giant boats [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so the tunnel is going to have a span of uh over seven kilometers for project one is that right [Music] 7.74 kilometers so just the beginning so audience do you remember just now when I was introducing the tunnel wall they are connected by giant boats like this so I would like to oh my God it's really heavy so each [Music] foreign locates [Music] so over there I believe that's the head of the shield machine [Music] [Music] for the entire head of the of the shield machine it was consists of different parts we cannot see the the front of it but just know from the model we have seen the the front of the shield machine is it has many cutter heads to cut Hooks and rocks and uh 300 they have a module to to adjust the pressures so I don't know whether so I feel like this part when looking at it it's sort of like a like a module in a space station [Music] the system also works like the market because it has different modules and to it to adjust the pressures uh for staffs to enter in sometimes staff need to enter the modules to work so they have to make sure the pressure is adjusted in real time and now how about we enter the can we enter the control room to have a quick work [Music] [Music] is the control room foreign [Music] over there uh on the monitor screen so is that the front of the shield machine and now uh I would like to ask uh invite another guest which is the project the manager of the Charming line he will tell us something more about the control room welcome Mr Wang for joining cpts so what is what is showing on the monitor screen right now the inside part of the of the cutter heads just a woman foreign [Music] so now the the cutter head is rotating at a normal speed which is about one minute uh rotate once and just now I was telling our audience that the control group that the construction site even didn't stop uh during spring festivals so I've seen some of the Spring Festival couplets outside the door so what kind of celebrations or activities here for staffs working here to spend the Spring Festival well well welcome back so sorry for the signal because we are under 30 meters underground so the signal is not quite stable and just now we were talking about because I've seen Spring Festival couplets there so I know that a lot of staff are working even during the a time that was supposed to reunite with their families so how are we going to how did we spend spring festivals here foreign so uh during Spring Festival the staffs working here they also make dumplings together they have the collective activities like uh sticking couplets together to to spend the festival so are there other you know kind of rewards and also of course there are rewards and subsidies that's the most important thing for them to work in during Spring Festival holidays well thank you very much Mr Wong for joining cgtn and now we are going out because in the first half hour program I said I believe some of you must remember that that many lifting Jacks are forcing The Shield machine to move forward so now we are going to see the process the lifting tests they are moving they are forcing the head up foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like one centimeter to five centimeters per minute so it's not quick process and for the entire time I was gonna spend years to to connect with these two islands and so now we cannot move any further to the field because [Music] so by the process about over 200 meters inside the tunnel and we explore the construction site and how the process is going and with China use indicated restrictions and has to keep us Place everything is quickly back to normal just like the construction site today and as the series Kickstart 2023 I'm hoping the project is also taking a very good start at the year of 2023 and again thank you very much and that's the end of our live streaming bye for now bye-bye foreign

onKy1N90vvs,Biden pledges to support Ukraine 'for as long as it takes' on surprise visit,"President Biden spent 10 hours taking a train to Kyiv to underline his message that the US will stand by Ukraine “for as long as it takes”.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

The surprise visit came just days before the first anniversary of Russia's invasion, and Mr Biden was quick to honour the courage and sacrifice of Ukrainians, while threatening further sanctions against anyone helping the Russian war effort. 
-----------------------  
Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News",1,he worked as something strange this morning and for once it wasn't the war the city's Center was closed amid a barrage of not missiles but anticipation and only one motorcade was allowed on the road to the bemusement of some and the Delight of others in a city listening out for every rumor and every air raid siren under the blanket of secrecy of a special visitor without the military help provided by America in the last year of war the president walking here today might have been called Putin not Biden he is hailed here as a savior for him to show up in person in the glare of sirens is a big deal but President Biden also tried a fine line between supplying American weapons but not troops between the war partly fought on its behalf but not declared in its name at the presidential Palace the two walk side by side by age they could easily be father and son and both need each other zelenski Biden for sheer survival Biden zelenski to tap into his Spirit to renew the vows between the west and its values the president started with the memory almost exactly a year old it was very late at night in Washington very early in the morning here in cave Russian planes were in the air and tanks were rolling across your border you told me that you could hear the explosions in the background I'll never forget that and the world was about to change you know one year later Keith stands and Ukraine stands democracy stands the American stands with you and the world stands with you president zelenski responded by saying that this year 2023 must be the year of victory and that's how long we're going to be with you Mr President for as long as it takes we'll do it but with what for Ukraine to drive Russia from all its territory it needs the kind of long-range weapons that President Biden did not promise today [Music] but what he did give his host was a moment to milk in a war fought on social media as well as on the battlefield within an hour of Biden leaving the Ukrainian government had put together the music video version of History [Music] divine intervention won't win this war for Ukraine it'll be the ability to produce more missiles and artillery shells than Russia in a brutal conflict of attrition in which Russia already behaves as if it's at war with NATO Biden now has his star on kiev's alley of Bravery for visiting foreign leaders but who can really tell at this stage where this alley will lead but this bond of friendship will keep demanding and when if at all the West will say no more so there's the first question so what do they make of today's visit in places nearer to the front line in this world well our International editor Lindsay Hilson is in the southern southern city of Odessa now Lindsay what do they make of this visit of Biden's visit Where You Are Matt the people I spoke to today were hugely enthusiastic they said it had one woman said it makes me feel that we can be victorious but then she also went on to say what we really need is weapons weapons more weapons now President Biden did say that the US would be providing another half a billion dollars worth of weapons that is a lot of weapons but still you have to think about the facts on the ground at the moment just take 105 millimeter Howitzer shells the ukrainians are using as many of those in a month as the U.S manufactures in a year in a whole year and it's not easy to turn that around and make more and more and more and then there's the issue of what the military analysts call Mass the number of soldiers that you can put onto the battlefield now the Russians have made gains recently because they've just thrown in a lot more soldiers the population of Ukraine is 43 million the population of Russia is 143 million so that just goes to show how many more soldiers Russia can put on the battlefield and how difficult it is for Ukraine as they wait for more modern weapons from America and Europe now tomorrow Lindsay all eyes will be on Moscow where President Putin will give a very important speech what can we expect well people I spoke to in Odessa today were very scared about that they said they were really worried about what Putin was going to say and what Putin was going to do it's been pretty quiet here in Odessa in recent weeks but they're worried that there's going to be more cruise missile attacks on infrastructure one woman I spoke to was going back to kharkiv in the north where her family was she said that it had been held there and she was worried that the next few days were going to be even worse and then the other issue is that the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi is expected in Moscow as you said either later tonight or tomorrow now President Biden said today the world stands with you to zelenski that's not completely true much of the South is not with President zielinski a lot of countries particularly in Africa are rather tending towards the Russian side and in Asia too and of course the most important one is China China has not provided weapons to Russia except for some drones which are commercially available but the Americans are very worried and Anthony blinker and the Secretary of State said this weekend they're very concerned that China may be on the brink of providing Weaponry to Russia that would completely change things China is one of the biggest manufacturers of weapons including High Precision weapons in the world that would change everything militarily and geopolitically as well Lindsay thanks very much indeed well on that note almost a year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine what had been The Wider ramifications of this war around the world even as President Biden was choosing to visit Kiev the Chinese foreign minister as we just heard was reportedly on his way to Moscow so is the globe once again forming into two opposing blocks here's Jonathan rugman for Joe Biden Europe is a war-prone continent America would rather Escape but never quite can because the Cold War never really ended forcing the West to hold Ukraine close in a way a year ago nobody was quite sure it would years ago it was President Kennedy rallying an embattled West Berlin a historic morale Boost after a wall had been erected by the Soviet East foreign [Music] [Applause] when that wall did come down years of war in the former Yugoslavia followed and America belatedly intervened now to Ukraine where Russia's imperialist ambition was rekindled where it turns out that the end of History never happened the Russians take no lectures from American Presidents about Invasion this was George Bush secretly visiting his troops in Iraq 20 years ago Barack Obama did the same in Afghanistan in 2010 of course the Russians had been there done that and when the american-led mission ended two years ago it was in humiliation and nation-building failure Ukraine has breathed new life into a battered NATO alliance and this is a war that Joe Biden can sell back home as long as American lives are not being lost at the weekend his secretary of state warned his Chinese counterpart not to supply the Russian's weapons in what is becoming a Battleground for Global influence China's top Diplomat Wang Yi was in Hungary today welcomed in a country which is a NATO and EU outlier dependent on Russian energy America's fear is that China will invade Taiwan if Western resolve crumbles and Vladimir Putin wins in Ukraine at the weekend the North Koreans test launched a ballistic missile with a range of over 500 Miles another reason why the Americans would rather pivot from Europe to the Pacific the general assembly is now voting North Korea is one of 40 countries including India and South Africa which refused to condemn Vladimir Putin at the U.N and many of them resent Washington's strong arming them into taking sides and after a year of trench warfare it's perhaps no coincidence that this is the bafta winning film of the moment Ukraine is not northern France but on the Eastern front it is another War of Attrition a war with no victory in sight and no sign of the mutual exhaustion required for both sides to stop Jonathan rugman reporting we're joining me now here on the balcony is the Ukrainian MP Alexander mareshko who heads up the Foreign Affairs committee uh in the parliament here thank you very much for coming back on the program after all these months how did you feel when you saw President Biden in your city today well to me it was a true Miracle Because deep down I hope that something like that might happen when we found out that President Biden is coming to Poland we hoped we realize that it's impossible politically for safety reasons but it happened you didn't know he was going to come I didn't know how did you find out about it well unexpectedly I was heading to my place of work to the Parliament and then I realized that I cannot I cannot move because because everything was shocked wasn't it they've lost every Road in the center and the parliament's just down there yeah the central part was blocked by police and then I realized that something is going on and I couldn't believe my eyes that I saw from a distance President Biden and to us it's a huge boost to our morale you've had macron I think a couple of times all I've chose the German Center Boris Johnson practically lives here um so why is Biden so much more important it's the obvious isn't it it's America first of all uh he is a true leader of the Free World and our president is also leader of free world so we had in the same place uh the biggest leaders of three Democratic World which is very symbolic it's it's a hugely symbolic event to us and yet he did not promise you the weapons that you know your foreign minister and your president specifically asked for at the Munich security conference long-range missiles and fighter jets oh we don't lose hope I think that this time this road from no to yes will be much shorter because I believe that we'll get everything what we need and very soon because that is a road very well traveled isn't it whenever you ask for something the International Community says yeah maybe maybe not and then a couple of months later you've got it but you need the stuff right now don't you yes we we say that we need it for yesterday because such every Weaponry helps to save lives of our soldiers and civilian population but we see that the attitude of our allies is very Dynamic and they give more and more support to Ukraine we know that not the entire world is on your side uh the India abstained at the security Council and rather the general assembly of the United Nations South Africa is against you and crucially China the Chinese foreign minister is on his way to Moscow right now and uh of course there were talks of the weekend from The American Secretary of State that China might even be providing lethal Aid to Russia so how worried are you about that we're worried we're concerned but I believe that China fears sanctions by the United States and the thing is that China is a close Ally to Russia we understand this but our support and our help are sanctions by the U.S and China is afraid of these sanctions but China could swing the more war more in Russia's favor couldn't it end at the moment things are not going to heavily well for you on the battlefield well China is moving in this direction because China is supporting Russia economically by buying in huge quantities Russian oil and gas and finance and Russian war machine uh China supports the U.S spreading Russian uh propaganda and Russian narratives which is dangerous and Chinese voting against Ukraine at the general assembly which is also dangerous we are aware of this but we don't count on China your both sides are exhausting each other's reservoirs of men and also material I mean it is a very very costly war in both of treasure and lives when do you think the time might come where you sit down with the other side and talk about peace well I believe that first we need to win this war and we do hope that this year will become Victorious to us but what is winning winning actually look like uh winning to us is very simple in terms of international law is uh liberation of our whole territory including Crimea of course including Crimea absolutely even though you've been privately told by some officials in the west that that is very unlikely I I'm sure that we will return Crimea just a matter of time because to us if we don't do it will create very dangerous precedent when the aggressor is not punished by rewarded by territorial concessions it shouldn't happen because otherwise it creates it opens Pandora box so to speak Alexander marisco thank you very much indeed

f00V9MQBhg8,What’s behind the South China Sea dispute? | Start Here,"China and its neighbours all want a piece of the South China Sea. 
Rights to fish, territory, oil and gas. 
This fight has it all, including the potential for war. 
So why is ASEAN struggling to manage the problem? And why won’t China share?

#South_China_Sea
#ASEAN_Al_Jazeera_ENglish
#Al_Jazeera_English",1,"Let’s talk about the fight over the South China Sea. It’s rich in oil and gas, there are loads of fish and the shipping lanes are some of the busiest  in the world. China wants control of it.  But other countries say they have rights to it too.  And the Americans — well they have trade routes through there worth hundreds of billions of dollars. So what’s behind China’s claim over these waters? Why won’t it share?  And could it all lead to war? China has been a land-based power for millennia so it’s never had 
much of a navy so it’s never had 
much of a navy until now. Today China wants to be a naval force across two oceans the Indian and the Pacific. That’s to make
 sure it can trade  with the rest of the world and get enough oil and gas to drive its economy. And to do that  Beijing wants to control
 the South China Sea. But there’s a lot of competition. Taiwan, for one, claims 
many of the same rights  that China does. Then there’s Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia  and Brunei  they want to
 protect their turf  whether it’s rights to islands, seabed oil or fishing grounds. Indonesia’s in there too. And the Americans they want to protect those valuable shipping lanes. So no shortage of players.  The question is how is this all going to be resolved? And then there’s the third option which involves  pushing some kind of compromise between China and its neighbours. Countries like Taiwan and others   that are members of ASEAN have tried. But no one expects that to go anywhere anytime soon  because China knows 
what it wants. And it’s been working towards that for a long time. We’re talking about 
China’s nine dash line.  Back in 1929 the Chinese took a bunch of old British   sailing charts and told cartographers to draw  China’s borders. One of them drew nine dashes around the entire 
South China Sea. And as far as the Chinese were concerned that was that. So then in 2013 China added a tenth line to take in Taiwan. So then in 2013 China added a tenth line to take in Taiwan. Its appetite seems 
to be growing. It’s easy enough to understand why China   wants control when you
 look at the numbers. Around 40% of the world’s liquefied natural gas  passes through the South China Sea — from the Gulf through the Indian Ocean and on to places like China. The amount of trade that 
sails through there  is worth $3 trillion a year — one-third of the world total. So there’s an expression in Latin that goes: If you want peace 
prepare for war. Now China has no immediate interest in war  but it wants to ensure its access to the South China Sea if it comes to that. In the west the main 
shipping lane  from the Indian Ocean narrows to just 3 km. And it’s surrounded by American allies. In the east there’s Taiwan which has tonnes of 
American weapons and could block China from getting to the Pacific. So to help stake its 
territorial claim  China has planted its flag on contested islands  that are in those waterways. In the Paracels China’s built a bunch of outposts  while in the Spratlys it’s 
added over 13 sq km of reclaimed land since 2013  and turned them into 
military bases. It may be unacceptable 
  to the Americans but neither the Obama nor the Trump administrations are seen to have 
accomplished much. The US’ main way of asserting navigational rights   and freedoms is having its navy sail  through the South China Sea. It also conducts military exercises in the region sometimes with warships from France, Japan and Australia in 
the Bay of Bengal. In July things got a bit hairy. The Chinese and Americans both held naval exercises in the South China Sea. The US sailed in with two aircraft carrier strike groups. And the Chinese 
accused the Americans  of escalating things.  Before the US elections 
the Trump team gave it one last shot — with mixed results. What everyone’s been trying to do is get China  to obey the law — namely 
the UN Convention   on the Law of the Sea. The law establishes
 what are called  exclusive economic zones.  These extend 
200 nautical miles  out from a country’s coastline  regardless of whether it’s the mainland or an island. And China signed 
up to that law. So the Philippines did the only thing it could. It took China to court.    One of the big issues was fishing rights. In 2013 the Philippines argued that China had no right to the Scarborough Shoal. It filed a case 
against the Chinese  with an international 
tribunal at The Hague. Judges ended up siding 
with the Philippines. Remember China’s
 territorial claim based   on that nine dash line? Well in 2016 the court concluded that it’s invalid. Since the 1990s ASEAN  that association of South Asian countries has tried to cobble together a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea.  The idea was to control China’s ambitions.  China hadn’t shown much interest in a code back then. But after losing the case 
 with the Philippines the Chinese started 
 to push for one.  Though some in ASEAN questioned their motives. There’s another problem.  Not everyone in ASEAN is eager to offend a country as powerful as China. Vietnam has repeatedly butted heads with China over their competing claims. This year’s ASEAN summit was hosted by Vietnam  and a lot of it by video because of the pandemic. But the social distancing wasn’t expected to help delegates reach any agreements   on the South China Sea. The problem with the 
South China Sea  is that it’s vast and the 
stakes are high. There are a lot of heavily armed countries defending their 
interests there. And China’s coastguard as well as Chinese militia using fishing boats often cause confrontations   on the open sea. Many analysts worry about all of that provoking a military response
 from someone. But strangely enough 
the whole dispute also sort of just bubbles 
away under the radar. The Chinese see the 
South China Sea as essential to their survival. Thing is it’s important to everyone there.  That’s why this whole dispute isn’t going away. But China’s been around for thousands of years.  If anyone is good at playing the long game, it’s China. As with all our Start Here episodes this primer  is to get us started. But there’s a lot more information out there to help us understand what’s going on in the South China Sea. As always subscribe wherever you’re watching this video  and I’ll see you next week."

Saudi Arabia and the US have a partnership that's been in the making for over seven decades. It started after World War II and survived the Iranian Revolution, the Cold War, the Gulf War, September 11, and the proliferation of conflicts across the Middle East. This whole time, the US has been selling weapons to Saudi Arabia -- now its number one customer. Saudis bought bombs, tanks, guns, and planes over the years to defend themselves from various threats. The US supplied those weapons because the Saudi’s threats have usually been a threat to the US as well.

Today, there's a shift in the relationship. Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen has created the worst humanitarian disaster in the world - and thrown the Middle East into chaos. The problem is, the Saudis are using US bombs to do it.

Or Twitter: http://goo.gl/XFrZ5H",1,"On August 9, 2018 a fighter jet dropped a
bomb on this street in Dahyan, Yemen. It exploded here, near a busy marketplace. Killing 40 children on a school bus. The plane was from a coalition led by Saudi
Arabia. They have conducted thousands of airstrikes
in Yemen since 2015 - many aimed at civilian targets. This is the bomb. And this photo, reportedly taken after the
attack, shows that the serial number - 94271 - corresponds to a 500-pound laser-guided
bomb built by the Lockheed Martin corporation. It was made in the United States. In fact, most of Saudi Arabia’s weapons
are. The US is the biggest arms dealer in the world
- and Saudi Arabia is its number one customer. For nearly 75 years, the two countries
have been strategic allies — trying to keep the Middle East stable for their own benefit. But today, the Middle East has fallen apart. And Saudi Arabia has been using US weapons
to make it worse. So why does the US sell Saudi Arabia so many
weapons… and will it ever stop? In 1938, a lot of it was discovered in the
new country of Saudi Arabia. ""For here are more proved and readily accessible reserves than in all of North and South America together."" In 1945, US President Franklin Roosevelt made
a deal with the Saudi King AbdulAziz al-Saud: The Saudis would provide the US with a safe,
reliable source of oil and in exchange, the US would support and protect the Saudis. This was at a time when the US was making
other alliances in the Middle East. ""Oil, however. Together with its strategic location, it has made this area important in world affairs."" But at first, US arms sales to their allies in the Middle
East were limited. The US hoped fewer weapons would mean less conflict and therefore a steady
supply of oil. But that didn't last for long. War broke out between Israel and these Arab
States. in 1967. This put the US in an awkward situation - it
had allies on both sides. The US ultimately decided to sell fighter
jets to Israel to give them an advantage over the Arab states. But war broke out again six years later. This time, the US sent thousands of tons of
arms to Israel . This outraged the Arab allies, including Saudi
Arabia. So they struck back. ""The oil producing countries of the Arab world decided to use their oil as a political weapon."" These Arab states cut-off oil supplies to
the US to protest their support of Israel... And it caused a crisis. The price of oil nearly quadrupled in the
US. The cut-off ended several months later when
the US brokered a peace deal between Israel and Egypt. But to help rebuild its relationship with
its Arab allies, the US decided to sell them weapons. And the Saudis were particularly eager to buy. By the 1970s, oil profits had made Saudi Arabia’s
monarchy extraordinarily rich - and they could afford to buy a range of advanced weapons. Between 1970 and '76, US sales to Saudi Arabia
skyrocketed. In the meantime just
across the Gulf, Iran had emerged as another extremely strategic ally to the US. Like Saudi Arabia, it was a large, oil-rich
country. But more importantly, it shared this long
border with the Soviet Union - America’s primary enemy during the Cold War. So, President Nixon said the US would ““sell
Iran virtually any conventional weapons it wanted.” Together, Saudi Arabia and Iran became America’s
Twin Pillars in the Middle East. For the US, selling them guns, bombs, planes,
and tanks was a way to prevent the Soviets from entering the Middle East, and protect the oil supply. And having these countries rely on American
weapons gave the US important leverage to dictate how and when they were used. It was also an important sign of trust and
support between allies. US arms came with years of training and maintenance,
so each weapons deal with Saudi Arabia, for example, was a long-term commitment to work
together. This would prove to be important because Saudi
Arabia and the US would soon have to rely even more on each other… In 1979, the Islamic revolution overthrew
the pro-US Shah of Iran who was replaced by a religious leader; Ayatollah Khomeini. Suddenly, one of the America’s twin pillars
turned on it. The new Iran was ambitious and extremely anti-American. While armed with $9B worth of American-made weapons. And it was also the enemy of Saudi Arabia. Each saw itself as the leader of the muslim
world; and started competing for influence in the Middle East. So Saudi Arabia continued to want more weapons and the US continued to sell them. In the meantime, the Soviet Union, which had
been developing its own alliances in the Middle East for decades, started selling advanced weapons to countries like Iraq and Syria. At this point a full-scale arms race was taking
place in the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia was the biggest buyer thanks to the US. ""I do not think it contributes towards achieving peace in the Middle East. And therefore I think this arms sale should be disapproved."" These sales sparked fierce debates in the
US. Like on June 5, 1986 when President Ronald
Reagan supported the sale of 2,500 missiles to Saudi Arabia: ""Our proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia will increase the Saudi's ability to withstand the threat from radical Arab states."" Many in Congress were skeptical about
selling more weapons in the name of defense... ""Over the past 30 years , the US has sold over 50 billion dollars worth of military weapons and services  to the Saudis. More than we've sold to any nation on Earth. Where are the reciprocal acts of friendship?"" Reagan argued that the arms sales were an
important part of the alliance. ""We have had for more than 40 years now, a relationship and an agreement, mutual security agreement, with the Saudi Arabians. And it has been beneficial to both
of us."" He insisted that it was important that the US be the ones to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia… ""First of all, look, they’re gonna have arms,
whether we do it or not. But when they have them from us, there are
restrictions on their use of them; and that they are restricted to using them defensively. Or then there are things that we will do."" ""It is not a very valid argument, but I can use the same argument on drugs out in the street. If I don’t sell drugs to someone, someone
else will. The question is not whether someone else
will, the question is whether it’s right."" Congress pushed for some changes to the deal before ultimately approving the sale. In fact, Congress would never fully block a foreign arms sale. Over the next 20 years, the strength of the
US-Saudi alliance would waiver, but their reliance on each other never quite
stopped. The Soviet threat vanished when the country
collapsed in 1991. But Iraq under Saddam Hussein emerged as a
new threat to both Saudi Arabia and the US. So the Saudis went all out. In 1993, the US and Saudi Arabia agreed on
a record number of arms sales. But arms sales decreased during the late 1990s
and hit rock-bottom after the 9/11 attacks - 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens. Two years later, the US launched a war in
Iraq and threw the Middle East into chaos. It turned to Saudi Arabia as a partner and arms sales started increasing again. Over the next decade, the Middle East continued
to fall apart... And Iran took advantage of the chaos by supporting
militant groups in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq - turning these conflicts into proxy wars. To the US, this is Iran destabilizing the
Middle East, but to the Saudis, this is Iran closing in on them. So Saudi Arabia started using its weapons - aggressively. Along with a coalition of allies, Saudi Arabia
intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015. The Saudis claimed they wanted to restore
the government, but only made the conflict worse. Iran stepped in to support the rebels, turning Yemen into a proxy war. The Saudi's aggressive tactics have  created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Out of nearly 16,000 airstrikes since 2015,
the Saudi-coalition has hit civilian targets a third of the time. Most estimates put the civilian death toll well
over 10,000. The UN has found that many of the civilian
attacks were intentional and could be considered war crimes. The problem is the US has continued to sell
arms to Saudi Arabia this whole time. In fact, the Obama Administration approved
the most arms sales to the Saudis in US history. These included not just new weapons, but also
replacements for weapons used or damaged in Yemen. Including this bomb: likely sold to Saudi
Arabia in 2015 and dropped on a school bus in 2018. ""$3 billion dollars, $533 million dollars,
$525 million dollars. That’s peanuts for you."" While the Trump administration focuses on
the supposed economic benefits of selling weapons, it misses the real point:
Decades of arming Saudi Arabia was supposed to give the US some leverage over it. But that's clearly not working. Saudi Arabia’s leader - Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman is accused of ordering the brutal murder of a US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And it’s sparked historic resistance to
the US-Saudi relationship… ""I will not support arms sales until all responsible for the death of Mr. Khashoggi have been brought to justice."" And I will no longer support the war in Yemen as constructed."" ""The bombing of a school bus full of children and other civilian targets is not something I want America's fingerprints on."" So will the US actually stop selling weapons
to Saudi Arabia? It’s a difficult question.
The Middle East is more unstable than ever. After 75 years, Saudi Arabia and the US still
need each other. But it’s clearly not a trustworthy alliance
anymore."

For the past several years scientists have been trying to account for the 8 million metric tonnes of plastic that we dump into the ocean each year. The assumption was that a large portion of it was floating out in one of the large garbage patches, where swirling debris accumulates thanks to ocean gyres. But recent measurements of the amount of trash in the patches fell far short of what’s thought to be out there. 

Scientists are getting closer to an answer, which could help clean-up efforts and prevent further damage to marine life and ocean ecosystems. 

In a previous version of this video, we mistakenly compared the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to the area of Australia. It is in fact roughly 1.6 million square kilometers, a little more than twice the size of the state of Texas. A huge area, but not nearly as big as Australia.

Or Twitter: http://goo.gl/XFrZ5H",1,"Between Hawaii and California, 
--in an area about twice the size of Texas-- Is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.   For decades, tons of our plastic debris has
accumulated there because of swirling ocean currents. It looks like a cloudy soup: and that’s
because the plastic objects are spaced far apart, and they range in size from large debris
to microscopic.There are at least 4 other garbage patches like this in the world, And
after scientists discovered them, starting in the 90s.   They thought that this might be where a lot
of the plastic ended up, out there floating on the surface. But recently, scientists brought large nets
to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and took a closer look at the objects they pulled out. They found water bottles And hard hats
And bottle caps  And toothbrushes
And toilet seats And laundry baskets
And using what they found, they were able to calculate how much debris was in all of
the garbage patches.  There were about a few hundred thousand tons
of plastics at the surface of the ocean, which is a huge number. It is a big number. But a few hundred thousand metric tons of
plastic is only about 1% of the estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic scientists believe
is emitted into the ocean every year. So scientists have been left investigating
a mystery: Where does the rest of the ocean’s plastic go?  
This is clue number 1 in the case of the missing plastic: a sea floor sediment sample 
It was taken from the bottom of the Santa Barbara Basin, off the coast of California.  It represents a measure of time, from 1870
at its deepest layer of sediment, up until 2009.  But this period, from 1945 to 2009, is where
the study authors were focused on.  It’s the era of plastic production. In these layers, the study authors found plastic
fibers and fragments that were 1 millimeter or smaller in size.  They found more and more plastic particles
as the years went on, doubling every 15 years.  That rate is nearly identical to the rate
of global plastic production.  Ss soon as you see a layer of microplastic
you pass the 1950’s and that's the legacy of our generation. This is Laurent Lebreton—he works at the
Ocean Cleanup, and led the study of the objects in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. And this will be there forever. We know that.  The sea sediment study looked at microplastics—particles
smaller than 5 millimeters. These either come from clothing fibers, or
they are the result of larger plastics breaking down.  We’ve found these tiny particles floating
throughout the ocean, And even in the guts of the ocean’s tiniest creatures, like plankton. But the sediment study shows that 
some of our plastic is likely hiding, buried in the sea floor, too. But here’s another clue: This is a plastic
bag, captured 2,500 meters below the surface of the Arctic deep sea. It’s one of over 2,100 photographs taken
with this deep sea camera.  Part of the work that we're doing is to look
at the impact of climate change in the Arctic. We use towed camera surveys to look at the
impact on large animals like starfish and snails, sponges. And while I was doing these surveys, I saw
that more and more plastic debris was on the sea floor. Melanie Bergmann’s research shows that large
plastic objects don’t just float on the surface or degrade into microplastic — some
of them sink without breaking down.  One study found that about 50% of plastic
in landfills is more dense than seawater, which means these objects could sink on their
own. But even those other 50 percent may actually
travel to the sea floor with time, because what we see is that the debris which is floating
on the ocean surface becomes colonized with biota over time… barnacles, mussels, all
sorts of different organisms… then it becomes heavier and heavier and at certain at a certain
point and then starts to sink. Bergmann’s research is difficult to replicate
throughout the ocean, because of the challenge of surveying the deep sea environments. But it suggests that some of that missing
plastic might be sitting on the seafloor, intact. Another clue complicates the mystery, though:
this plastic crate, from Taiwan. It’s one of the objects excavated during
that harvest in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. And what struck researchers was its production
date: 1971.  When they looked at the production dates of
other objects, they saw a trend: a lot of it was old trash. This was a new lead: because if the majority
of plastic pollution degraded into microplastic or fell to the ocean floor, then what you’d
see in garbage patches would be new plastic. And that changed the story...the plastic that
is accumulated at the surface of the ocean is actually very persistent. The plastic we find in subtropical oceans
may actually be there for decades, if not centuries. It turns out the new plastic is far closer
than the open ocean or the bottom of the deep sea. Lebreton’s research found that plastic objects
on coastlines have more recent production dates than plastic in the open ocean.  This clue led scientists to think a lot of
debris actually stays close to shorelines around the world—hidden in plain sight.  Some of that will end up in the middle of
the ocean and garbage patch, but actually a lot of it stays fairly near shore and hop
from beach to beach to beach.  Erik Van Sebille is an oceanographer, and
is building an ocean model that predicts where our missing plastic ends up.  The completed model will be finished in 2022,
but in the meantime he and his team publish initial results to a Twitter feed. We use simulations of the ocean currents and
they're a bit like weather models for the ocean. So they tell us how the currents are moving
stuff around. And then we put in virtual plastic… And then we move that plastic with the ocean
flow. At the same time the plastic and fragment,
it can degrade, organisms start growing on it that weighs down the plastic so that it
slowly starts to sink into the deeper ocean. So in that way, we're doing like this gigantic
simulation of all of the ocean, of all the plastic moving around.  Van Sebille thinks that a majority of plastic
pollution is within 100 miles of shorelines,  continually getting washed back up on beaches,
down coastlines, or up and down to the sea floor. If the plastic continuously goes back and
forth between the coastline and offshore, that's a lot of rubbing and fragmenting and
scraping over the sand. This commotion helps explain the presence
of microplastics in sediments and animal guts, too. Laurent’s organization is working on cleaning
up the garbage patches in the middle of the ocean. But that won’t do much for the other 99%
of our plastic: The microplastics becoming part of our food web and geologic record. The larger debris sinking to the bottom of
the ocean. And, more likely than not, getting washed
up on beaches.  Like this one, where I recently visited, where
I found a mix of micro and larger plastics.  But knowing where plastics end up can help
us keep this plastic heap from growing.  These photos were taken by volunteers at an
annual, international coastal clean-up event, organized by the Ocean Conservancy.  Where people volunteer to pick up plastic
on beaches near them.  The most common objects they find are food
wrappers.  Cigarette butts.  Plastic bottle caps
And plastic cups and plates.  The easiest way to get plastic like this out
of the ocean, is to prevent it from entering in the first place. With better recycling programs. Or producing and using less plastic altogether.  There are nearly 400,000 miles of coastline
around the world, not all of it accessible for people.  But, knowing that most of our plastic pollution
hangs out along shorelines before it becomes microplastics or floats out to the open sea,
means beach clean-ups can go a long way in preventing further damage. So if you see plastic pollution on a beach—all
the more reason to pick it up."

that of the most dangerous cities in the world. These conditions have sparked months of protests
against the president, Nicolas Maduro. And it’s easy to see why: the country has
become measurably worse since his election in 2013. A poll showed that about 80% of Venezuelans
want Maduro removed from office. But instead, the opposite has happened: Maduro
has consolidated his power bringing the country closer to authoritarian rule. Maduro’s political ambition became evident
in December 2015. Two years after he became president, a coalition
of opposition parties called the Democratic Unity Roundtable or MUD, won a two-thirds
majority in the National Assembly, putting Maduro’s rule at risk. In response, Maduro quickly forced out several
Supreme Court justices and filled the positions with cronies loyal to him. In March 2016, the court ruled to strip the
opposition-led National Assembly of its powers -- a move that sparked massive protests across
the country. The ruling was reversed a few days later,
but the damage was done -- protests continued to grow and have left about 100 dead and thousands
injured so far. Despite the violence and public outcry, Maduro
held a vote in July to elect a new governing body called the National Constituent Assembly,
which would have the power to rewrite Venezuela’s constitution and replace the National Assembly. And leave virtually non opposition to Maduro's rule. With Maduro's recent vote, Venezuelans didn’t have
a say in whether the assembly should exist. They only had the option to elect its members. But when Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez
proposed a constitutional rewrite in 1999, he first called for a referendum to propose
the election of the assembly. After most Venezuelans voted yes, they elected
a new National Constituent Assembly. See, unlike Maduro, Chavez was a charismatic
and beloved leader. In the 90s, he burst onto television sets
across the country. He blamed government corruption and Venezuela’s
elite for the economic inequality. His populist message resonated with the country’s
poor who eventually helped bring him to power. The key moment in his presidency came in 2004 when oil prices surged. Venezuela’s petroleum- dependent economy started booming and Chavez went on to spend billions from the profits on social-welfare programs for the poor. He subsidized food, improved the educational
system, built an enviable healthcare system and reduced poverty by more than half. These programs certainly helped the poor, but they served a purpose for Chavez as well. In order to be re-elected, he needed to keep
millions of poor Venezuelans happy. So he rigged the economy to do just that... He didn’t scale back Venezuela’s dependence
on oil and his unrestrained spending led to a growing deficit. Which meant all these programs would be impossible
to sustain if oil prices fell. After Chavez’s death, when Maduro took office
as his handpicked successor, that’s exactly what happened:
Oil prices plummeted in 2014 and Maduro failed to adjust. Hyperinflation has made medicines and food,
that was once subsidized, unaffordable for Venezuela’s poor, who now make up about
82% of the population. Like Chavez, Maduro has also rigged the economy
to keep himself in power, but this time it’s not benefitting the poor.
He’s exploited a complex currency system, put in place by Chavez. Maduro’s set the official exchange rate
at 10 bolivars per US dollar. But only his friends and allies have access
to this rate. In reality, the venezuelan currency has become
basically worthless. Most Venezuelans get their dollars on the
black market, where the rate is about 12,000 bolivar per dollar. The military, which got complete control of
the food supply from Maduro in 2016, is reportedly profiting off of this currency crisis. They import food at Maduro’s special currency
rate and sell it on the black market for a massive profit. So military generals and political allies,
crisis has offered a lucrative opportunity which has helped Maduro stay in power. But he can’t rely on that support alone... ...which brings us back to Maduro’s recent
power grab. The opposition boycotted the vote, but Maduro
held the vote for the new constitutional assembly anyway, and won a majority. ""Protests on the streets of Venezuela turned deadly after President Nicolas Maduro declares victory. The violence on Sunday very real The bomb went off near some motorcycle police wounding several. Election day clashes between protesters claiming at least 10 more lives. At least one candidate has been murdered, shot to death. Maduro's government is trying to create the illusion of public support. Thegovernment claimed about 8 million people,
or 40% of the country, voted. But experts put that number much lower, at
just 3 million people. The international community including Peru,
Canada, Spain, Mexico and Argentina condemned the election. The US imposed financial sanctions on Maduro
and members of his government. But Maduro’s assembly, filled with loyalists,
convened anyway and it swiftly removed attorney general Luisa Ortega, leader of the opposition. Armed groups reportedly arrested several other
opposition leaders too. Whether the group will rewrite the constitution
or postpone the next presidential election remains to be seen. For now, Maduro has unprecedented power over
a country that continues to spiral out of control."

#HighSpeedRail

Why The US Has No High-Speed Rail",1,"China has the fastest and largest
high-speed rail network in the world. The country has more than 19,000
miles of high-speed rail, the vast majority of which was built
in the last decade. Japan's bullet trains can reach speeds
of almost 200 miles per hour. And date back to the 1960s. They've become a staple for domestic travel
and have moved more than 9 billion people without a
single passenger casualty. France began service of the high-speed TGV
train in 1981 and the rest of Europe quickly followed. And high-speed rail is quickly expanding all
over the world in places like India, Saudi Arabia, Russia
Iran and Morocco. And then there's the U.S. The U.S. used to be one of the world's global
leaders in rail but after World War II there was a massive shift. If you look at the United States prior
to 1945, we had a very extensive rail system everywhere. It all was working great except a number
of companies in the auto and oil industries decided that for them to
have a prosperous future they really needed to basically help phase out all the
rail and get us all into cars. The inflexible rails permanently embedded
in cobblestones were paved over to provide smooth, comfortable transportation
via diesel motor coach. General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil
and a few other companies that got together and they were able to
buy up all the nation's streetcar systems and then quickly start
phasing out service and literally dismantling all the systems over
about a 10-year span. In the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower
signed a bill to create the National Interstate System. It allocated about $25 billion dollars
to build 41,000 miles of highways. The federal government paid for 90% of
that, the states covered the final 10 and rail fell by the wayside. Can't you see that this highway means a
whole new way of life for the children? And a way of life that we have
a chance to help plan and, and to build. We dedicated a huge amount of
dollars to building automobile infrastructure in the middle of the 20th century and
we're still kind of attached to that model of development. We went from a rail-served country to
a auto-dependent nation by the 1960s. We've become a car culture and it's
hard to break out of that cycle. Not to mention the fact that in
our political system we have very powerful oil lobbies, car manufacturing lobbies,
aviation lobbies, all the entities that the high-speed rail would
have to compete with. This is the American dream
of freedom on wheels. We average some 850 cars per
thousand inhabitants in the U.S., in China it's only 250. And we've never gone back. But according to some this
country's transportation ecosystem is reaching a tipping point. When you look at what's happening
with the corridor development, again states across the U.S. who are recognizing they are running out
of space to expand their highways or interstates. There are limits at airports, there
is aviation congestion, so what are the options? A better rail system is one
and could come with significant benefits. It's largely an environmental good to
switch from air traffic and car traffic to electrified
high-speed rail. That's a much lower
emission way of traveling. When the high-speed rail between Madrid
and Barcelona in Spain came into operation, I mean air travel just
plummeted between those cities and everyone switched over to high-speed
rail which was very convenient. People were happier. They weren't forced to switch, they did
it because it was a nicer option to take high-speed rail. There's a sort of a rule of thumb
for trips that are under three or four hours in trip length from city to city,
those usually end up with about 80 or 90 percent of the
travel market from aviation. Where rail exists and it's convenient
and high-speed, it's very popular. America I think is waking up to this
idea that rail is a good investment for transportation infrastructure. One survey showed 63% of Americans would
use high-speed rail if it was available to them. Younger people want it even more. Right now the main passenger
rail option in the U.S. is Amtrak. It's operated as a for-profit company
but the federal government is its majority stakeholder. Train systems reaching top speeds of over
110 to 150 miles per hour are generally considered high-speed and only one
of Amtrak's lines could be considered as such. That's its Acela line in the
Northeast Corridor running between D.C., New York and Boston. One of the challenges we face is that
the Northeast Corridor has a lot of curvature, a lot of geometry. We really operate Acela Express on an
alignment that in some places was designed back in the nineteen hundreds and
so it really was never designed for high-speed rail. And while the Acela line can reach up
to 150 miles per hour, it only does so for 34 miles of its 457 mile span. Its average speed between New York and
Boston is about 65 miles per hour, which is in stark contrast to
China's dedicated high-speed rail system which regularly travels at over
200 miles per hour. But some people are
trying to fix that. In 2008 California voted
yes on high-speed rail. Now, a decade later, construction is underway
in the Central Valley of the state. And right now it is the
only truly high-speed rail system under construction in the U.S. Ultimately high-speed rail is a 520
mile project that links San Francisco to Los Angeles and
Anaheim, that's phase one. And it's a project that's
being built in building blocks. So the one behind me is the
largest building block that we're starting with, this 119 mile segment. This segment will run
from Bakersfield to Merced. Eventually the plan is to build a
line from San Francisco to Anaheim, just south of L.A. But as it stands the state is almost
$50 billion short of what it needs to actually do that. The current project as planned would
cost too much and, respectfully, take too long. There's been too little oversight
and not enough transparency. We do have the capacity to complete
a high-speed rail link between Merced and Bakersfield. After Gavin Newsom made that speech
President Trump threatened to pull federal funding for the project. We will continue to
seek other funding. We hope the federal government will
resume funding the, contributing new funds to the project. I think in the future, as
the federal government has funded major construction of infrastructure over time
they'll again direct money to high-speed rail because in fact it's
not just California but other states are also interested in
high-speed rail systems. To complete the entire line as planned,
the official estimate is now over $77 billion and it's unclear where
the money will come from. So why is it so expensive? Part of the problem in California, the
big price tag is getting through the Tehachapi, very expensive tunneling, or over
the Pacheco Pass to get into San Jose from the Central Valley. You know, Eastern China, the flatlands
of Japan where they've built the Shinkansen, all of those are settings
where they have, didn't incur the very high expense of boring and tunneling
that we face so the costs are different. And a lot of the money is
spent before construction can even begin. Just in this little segment here
alone we're dealing with the private property owner, we're dealing with a
rail company, we're dealing with the state agency and so
just the whole coordination. Then we're dealing with a utility
company, just in this very small section; we had to relocate two miles
of freeway and that was roughly $150 million per mile. So there's a lot of moving pieces
to, you know, anywhere we start constructing. China is the place
that many folks compare. They have like 29,000 kilometers of high-speed
rail and 20 years ago they had none. So how have they been able
to do it so quickly? And part of it is that the state
owns the land, they don't have private property rights like we
have in the U.S. You don't have the regulations we have
in terms of labor laws and environmental regulations that
add to cost. It also delays the projects. For some reason and I've never really
quite seen an adequate explanation as to why costs to build transit or
many big infrastructure projects are just dramatically higher than in other parts
of the world, including in other advanced countries. But the bottom line is we're really
bad at just building things cheaply and quickly in the U.S. in general. So it's not just rail infrastructure
that is expensive, all transportation infrastructure is. Just the physical investment in the freeway usually
will be 5 to 8 to 10 million per mile but if you add
seismic issues and land acquisition and utilities and environmental mitigation and
remediation of soils and factors like that it can become as high
as 100 or 200 million a mile. The numbers for high-speed rail can vary
anywhere from 20 to 80 million per mile. The big reason why America is behind
on high-speed rail is primarily money. We don't commit the dollars needed to
build these systems, it's really as simple as that. And it's largely a political issue. We don't have political leaders who
really want to dedicate the dollars needed. There's a lot of forces in America
that really don't want to see rail become our major mode of transportation
especially because it will affect passenger numbers on airplanes, it'll
affect the use of autos. So you have the politics, the
message shaping and then the straight advertising and all three of those
coordinate and work together to keep America kind of focused on cars
and not focused on rail. Some of the earliest support for
rail came from the Nixon administration. Some of the original capital subsidies
and operating subsidies for urban transit came from the Republican party, so
I think it's only more recently that maybe this has shifted that more
liberal leaning folks who care about climate and a whole host of urban
issues have really argued for investing very heavily in rail. If you had Democratic leadership on the
Senate and a different president or potentially some leverage for a president to
sign a new budget bill with some dollars for high-speed rail,
that could override those objections from Republicans in Congress. But I think it's mostly ideological. They're big on highways. They're big on things
like toll roads. They just, they don't want the government
spending dollars on this kind of project and they see it as
something those socialist European countries do but not something that should be
done in, you know, car-loving America. In my judgment, it would take a
very strong federal commitment, almost sort of a post-Second World War interstate
highway kind of large scale national commitment. This is why some high-speed rail
projects are trying to avoid public funding altogether. One company, Texas Central, plans to build
a bullet train from Houston to Dallas without using a
dime of taxpayer money. We're taking what is laborious, unreliable
four-hour drive if you're lucky and turning that into a
reliable, safe 90 minutes. And when you look at that as a
business plan being driven by data, this is the right place to build the first
high-speed train in the United States. The Texas project is backed by investors
motivated to make a profit and will use proven
Japanese rail technology. Texas Central's goal is to
complete the project by 2025. Another private company is even further
along with its rail system, in Florida. It's expanding its higher-speed
train from Miami to Orlando. Orlando's the most heavily visited
City the United States. Miami is the most heavily visit
international city in the United States. It's too far to drive, it's too short
to fly, we had the rail link and that was really the
genesis of the project. Wes Edens has invested heavily in Florida's
rail project which used to be called Brightline. Brightline recently rebranded to Virgin
Trains as the company partnered with Richard Branson's Virgin Group. The team at Brightline, which is now
called Virgin Trains, has proven that it can work. The people actually want to get out of
their cars and they'd love to be on trains. In order to reach profitability, the
company sacrificed speed to save money. If you want to really go
high-speed you have to grade separate. So you basically have to build a bridge
for 250 miles that you then put a train on. That sounds hard, and it sounds expensive
and it's both of those things. So a huge difference in cost, a huge
difference in time to build and not that much of a reduction in service. And now tech companies are
getting involved with infrastructure projects. In the Pacific Northwest a high-speed
rail plan is underway to connect Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. Microsoft contributed $300,000 towards
research for the project. Our number one priority from Microsoft as
well it to really see and pursue this high-speed rail effort happen. If you look around the United States
and where all of the Fortune 500 companies are located they all are
in a similar situation to Microsoft. The housing is unaffordable,
traffic congestion is epic. It's too hard to get
anywhere and to get employees. So high-speed rail can solve this
same exact problem in numerous regions around the United States. So is the private sector the answer
to bringing high-speed rail to the U.S.? If the private sector wants to invest
in transportation and as long as it's not impinging on the public taxpayers I
don't see a problem with private sector moving forward. And I think there is some truth that
the private sector is gonna have much more of an incentive to hurry up
on the construction and get things done more quickly, more cheaply. That said, the private sector still has
to operate with the oversight and regulatory responsibilities of
the public sector. So for example environmental review doesn't
go away just because it's a private sector project. Labor standards don't go away. The difference is that they don't have to
keep trying to sell a project to the public for a vote to
raise taxes or sell bonds. Some people remain optimistic
that the U.S. can catch up to the rest of the
world and have a robust, high-speed rail system. We're building that right
now behind us. This 119 mile segment that we want
to expand with the money we already have to 170 miles, it's going to serve
a population of 3 million people in the Central Valley. So it's, not only do I
believe, but it's under construction. A lot of activity is now taking
shape, state rail authorities have been shaped in four or five states, so
they're actually taking these on now as a legitimate project
and moving forward. I think the future is very bright
for train travel in the United States. There's broad consensus with our policy
leaders in industry that it's time to move an infrastructure bill and
that will certainly help kickstart U.S. rail. Others are much less confident. I wish I were
a little more optimistic. It's just very difficult to
make the economics work here. No one has embraced it as a
strong part of their political platform. There's just too many other
tough pressing problems we're facing. I don't see us catching up
to where the world is. It would take such a massive infusion
of dollars for that to happen in California and probably waving a
number of environmental requirements and some other government regulations that
hinder the quick deployment of these projects in favor
of other values. My own instincts are that it's going
to be decades and decades of decades before you'll be able to go a
one-seat trip from San Diego to Sacramento or San Francisco. It'd be nice if there was just
one simple answer, it's this litany of factors that collectively add up that make this
so hard to pull off in the United States."

zbAxFEn1ZUw,The China-Russia Strategic Partnership in a Time of Turmoil,"The Jamestown Foundation is proud to present a forthcoming webinar on “The China-Russia Strategic Partnership in a Time of Turmoil” on Friday, January 27 at 11:00 AM EST.

Over the past several decades, Beijing and Moscow, bitter rivals throughout much of the Cold War, have developed a close strategic alignment. Deepening China-Russia ties are driven in large part by shared antipathy toward the United States and its allies, which both the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin perceive as presenting a multifaceted threat with military, economic, technological and ideological dimensions. For China, the importance of the relationship with Russia is underscored by its high-level designation in the official hierarchy of strategic partnerships. During President Xi Jinping’s June 2019 state visit to Russia, the relationship was upgraded to a “comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.”

Last year, when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics, China and Russia issued a joint statement on “International Relations Entering a New Era and Global Sustainable Development,” which declared their bilateral friendship had “no limits” or “forbidden” areas of cooperation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War has both complicated and increased the asymmetry in the relationship. China has lent limited diplomatic and economic support to Russia but has also repeatedly called for a cessation of hostilities and peace talks. Moreover, Beijing has demonstrated concern that the externalities of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, such as volatility in global commodity markets and worsened relations with Europe, are damaging its interests.

The Jamestown Foundation is pleased to host several leading experts to examine the current state of the China-Russia partnership and consider the outlook for the relationship in 2023 and beyond.

Editor-in-Chief, China Brief; China Program Manager, The Jamestown Foundation",1,foreign good morning everybody I just want to give everyone a second or two to trickle in those of us uh you that are joining us on Zoom um give everyone a moment or two to trickle in and we'll get started in about a minute here thank you foreign thank you everyone for joining us this morning I'm John espinal narn editor of China brief and China program manager here at the Jamestown Foundation today's discussion on the china-russia Strategic partnership comes at a timely juncture we are one year uh removed from the Beijing Olympic Summit between leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin uh which resulted in a joint statement in which the two sides both agreed there would be quote unquote No Limits to their cooperation and moreover after that were 11 months removed from the onset of full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine in late February uh she also has a new policy team that has taken the reins uh after the 20th party Congress and we'll have more clarity on that uh with the national people's Congress uh this well uh this spring later this spring okay um and while there's been some modest reduction intentions of late uh the U.S China strategic rivalry shows no signs of a baby despite the uh ups and downs of the past year uh both Russia and China have continued to emphasize the importance of maintaining and even deepening uh their strategic partnership and there's been signs that the partnership remains robust so just to give one example over the first 11 months of 2022 uh two-way trade volume I reached a record high in his annual year-end call with Putin she stated uh that in a changing and turbulent International environment it is important that China and Russia remain true to the original aspiration of cooperation and staying maintain strategic Focus enhanced strategic coordination and continue to be each other's development opportunity and Global Partners to bring more benefits to the two people and greater stability to the world uh nevertheless despite this uh High sounding rhetoric uh questions remain about how deep and extensive both the coordination and the cooperation is between leaders in Beijing and Moscow So today we're going to examine the level and extent of cooperation in three areas which will be covered by our three excellent speakers so first uh we have um Pavo bayev who's a non-resident a senior fellow on the center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings institution and he's going to talk us through the relationship between she and Putin and more generally the relationship between Chinese and Russian Elites um second we have uh Maya Nuance Maya is a senior fellow for Chinese security and defense policy at The International Institute for strategic studies or double I double s and she's going to talk us through the military and security relationship looking at military to military relations and arms finally last but not least I'm very glad to see him here we have a Sergey tsukonkin uh who's my colleague a senior fellow at the Jamestown foundation and a uh advisor at Gulf State analytics and Sergey um is an expert on um private security companies and private military contractors and he's going to look at the interaction and overlap between um China and Russia in two areas I think where they're they're key actors Africa and Central Asia so with that I've talked enough um Pavel let's go over to you and maybe you can get us started by talking about the relationship at the elite level uh thanks Bob thank you John I'm very glad to be a part of this conversation and there is a bit of a challenge for me because in fact not that much new is happening in this relationship uh it's hard to find this kind of sharp reference point yes Russia has a new Ambassador now in Beijing is a professional mid-60s speaks the language but generally he is no match the history the sister Andre Genesis who was really very good uh in his job uh paid the visit to Beijing brought a letter from uh Xi Jinping who was received very little is known about the content there was a conversation video conversation between Putin and excision ping and in that conversation I think what struck me was that the two readouts were quite different with different emphasis with different emissions with very significant differences but explaining to them I want to try to make a larger point I generally feel we now have a different pujin and different Xi Jinping a new quality involves and certainly it's not that new and it's not not that new in a sense these two hyenas have not changed their spots and the changes are not very recently it's not this week I think changes started in Early Autumn when uh there was a party Congress in Beijing certainly and when Putin announced the uh annexation of for Ukrainian regions and mobilization and I think at that moment in expert Community there was a misinterpretation of the meaning of both events as for Putin I think the experts expected that uh this annexation would signify a significant increase in Russian assertiveness in the occupied Ukraine probably in your offensive who is suc and party Congress I think the expert opinion thought there will be new strengthening of central control uh new consolidation of the same very rigid uh political line and I think in early November in mid-november we both discovered that the assessments are not quite On Target uh because uh pujian suffered a very humiliating defeat and had to withdraw from uh sherson region and Xi Jinping encountered surprise surprise protests with uh blank pieces of paper and also your joke coming through uh and uh at that moment a real change started that's where I think New Quality started to appear and with Putin is clear where the apology is going he is really going uh for in with the war and special operation is still called Special Operation but it is a very obvious change in the whole atmosphere in Russia in propaganda uh in mobilization of economy in preparation of a military reform that the war is becoming really the main thing you're inventing yourself as a war leader and trying to take the whole country on the wall pass I can take a lot about that I'm writing about this every week in Eurasia daily monitor uh but I really want to point towards changes in Beijing where I'm at much in the last certain ground uh my expertise here is much sooner but what I observe is that changes in uh Chinese politics go and draws a different direction from what what has been expected much less central control more flexibility greater space for private Enterprise generally less tightening of all screws and significantly more attempts to open up to restore dialogue with various external Partners to invite back investors particularly on the recent Davos former Forum very obviously the line to convince them that it's not just a temporary deviation but a real serious change that the economic climate is becoming much more favorable for them again as it used to be a few years back and as a part of that uh new course uh generally emphasis on the days galatian on reducing tensions and I think that the force coming visit by U.S state Secretary Anthony blinken uh to Beijing would consolidate this kind of trend would show more of this change and this change is really very worrisome for many Moscow um the the whole big hope in the Kremlin is about ever growing tensions between China and United States that's the only way in the in their perception that U.S can be distracted from the uh European European theater from Ukraine uh preoccupied with Asia Pacific Affairs Russia would gain uh more freedom of hands more freedom to uh launch is is offensive so these two changes in Chinese and Russian politics are generally going in different directions they are diverging Russia is becoming much more focused on the war and the going for greater more Region Center control and China is going for Less tensions for more opening for reducing uh the confrontation we first of all with United States [Music] and I think it's because of that we see these differences in the content of the conversation between Putin and serious presented into respective media uh in Russian media the point uh Putin made very strongly wasn't military technical cooperation we will probably hear more about this from in my presentation but uh yeah I don't think she mentioned that topic at all uh Putin was very uh welcome will send a very warm invitation to see to pay a visit to uh more uh stage visit to Moscow this spring and yesterday down proxy I haven't seen any uh uh any word of thanks for the invitation not to mention accepting it uh in the readouts what I saw on the Chinese side there was a point that the war in Ukraine needs to be brought to an end and there is no mention of Ukrainian the Russian readout at all so there is discrepancies probably again words are just words uh and we shouldn't take the uh discourse for the real politics but I think there is a real evidence to put under the proposition of kind of diverging political courses between Moscow and Beijing for once Uh Russian military uh are in desperate need of every kind of equipment from artillery shells to microchips to drones uh to tanks and in all these kind of clashes there are a lot of uh Russian equipment uh taking trophies are shut down I haven't seen the one bit which with the words made in China equipment comes from Builder who's from North Korea drones come from around nothing at all comes from China despite really desperate need uh in Russia on that a different bit of evidence probably can be found on the energy Market where Russia is under increasing pressure from Europe first of all which is uh weaponizing so to say energy Russia's energy dependency and punishing it very very severely Russia is very desperate now to sell its oil and from next week uh pressure will increase further with the ban on the petroleum products Uh Russian officials and Putin first of all was very adamant that all this Western pressure will come to not that the attempts to enforce the ceilings price ceiling on the Russian oil will be categorically rejected and we see that this price ceiling works that the spread and prices between Russian Benchmark euros and the uh brand uh Benchmark which used to be kind of three five ten uh US dollars is now more than 30. Russian oil is selling really cheap and China is a part of that because Russians attempt to sell more oil to China succeed only part which China is taking a bit more than usual and that explains the increase of the mutual trade as you mentioned John uh because oil was expensive last year it is going much cheaper now and the price which is uh uh air marks in Russian state budget 70 uh US dollars per barrel is hardly going to be achieved and China is a part of this uh of this problem Russia cannot sell enough oil to China or India is another part of the same problem but I think China in this regard is more significant there are other bits and pieces of evidence we talk a lot in this recent weeks about Russia's activities in Africa for that matter of our developing a group what they're doing there what's the real purpose was the scope of these activities more and more details come into on the surface because activities are quite secretive in clandestine in many regions there are some new developments in my Lane Burkina FASA but I haven't seen any evidence of cooperation between Russia and China and Africa in principle the interest could be quite compatible China needs resources from Africa uh Russia doesn't but Russia can provide some muscle for protective Genies investment for that matter it isn't happening doing their own dirty business with no uh no uh connections no Communications with China so my kind of bottom line from all this there could be more evidence presented for instance in that complete lack of cooperation in fighting the coveted epidemics where vaccines are not uh mutually recognized and really no cooperation is happening um so it is not that you know I am picking up bits and pieces here and there which contradict the the picture of ever deepening ever strengthening ever widening a strategic partnership as the two states uh often say high discourse as you have mentioned Joe so my important alignment is when you hear this hide this course you probably need to increase the proverbial grain of salt into a full teaspoon at least I don't see this part strengthening I see the two horses diverging and I see progress increasing I'll stop here don't want to give you a long lecture uh thanks Pablo that was very insightful I think I need a maybe a whole Shaker of salt um here but it's a great point I think both capitals have a you know have a incentive right to project an image of closeness uh with one another I think at least rhetorically so um let's get a little more into the the nitty-gritty here and um Maya let's turn to you I think um for a topic that will be of great interest I think to much of our audience which is the defense and security relationship so Maya over to thanks John and thanks for having me on um and it's great to follow such an excellent um intervention from um Pavel um so yeah I've been asked to talk a little bit more about the sino-russian kind of military relationship and I focus a little bit more in my research recently on the defense technological relationship between the two countries so that's what I'll I'll talk about mostly in my in my remarks today um with a little bit of extra thoughts at the end of this wider um bilateral relationship in terms of strategic collaboration um but I think it might be useful to just reiterate a little bit quickly um some information about uh the general context in which this relationship um has occurred I mean John you've already mentioned the February 4th statement in which both countries uh sign on to a limitless strategic partnership um and Wong e had said and China has reiterated over time that the uh China is willing to work with Russia to take the bilateral relationship to a higher new level in a new era I think in general that relationship has been deepening over time over the last decade or two not just in trade and investment but also in terms of political coordination messaging and symbolism and of course also in terms of military coordination and exercises such as joint exercises in the indo-pacific which serve Chinese strategic interests in in its own region um in the Far East um I would however note that though this is a deepening relationship there have been some limits to the overall strategic picture here in military terms there is more joint exercising but how joint how truly joint those exercises are I think has been questionable so on the Optics there seems to be a lot more activity and that doesn't necessarily mean that there's true integration of both militaries in defense technological terms or in operational terms and so that is something to keep in mind when we hear a lot about this deepening relationship and this Limitless strategic partnership moving forward it's interesting to think about the defense technological relationship I'm a little bit more closely because there has been such a shift in that bilateral balance of power between the two countries from where it started in the 1950s and 60s to uh to where it is today and what that might look like you know in my perspective very differently in the next few years following the consequences of Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine um from Chinese academics perspective when you read their papers and they say that China the the Chinese and Russian defense technological relationship has turned a corner and that China obviously was once very dependent on the USSR and on Russia for defense related Technologies but it's now considered more of a partnership of equals between the the two countries as China's own defense industry has modernized and become more competitive over time from the Chinese perspective however I don't think this is actually a limitless relationship um it's been mentioned a couple of times and um that might not be said as openly I think by government Representatives but certainly if you look at academic writings between uh from Chinese academics on the bilateral relationship you'll see that they point to issues such as lack of trust and border security issues differences in each other's political systems historical grievances tensions over each other's roles in Central Asia or the Arctic and so on and so forth so these tensions I think also have um limited uh have had impact on the bilateral Tech defense technological relationship as well um I think it's also really important that though I agree and I'll come to this at the end that we are seeing less of a overtly and all-encompassing positive uh view of this bilateral relationship from Chinese uh writings and online commentary and just use of language um more recently following the war of regression in Ukraine I think it is important to note that from the Chinese perspective and I suppose from the Russian as well this is always going to be viewed through the lens of U.S China rivalry and so no matter how frustrated the Chinese got um uh which they might very well be um the bigger picture here is still that both see uh a benefit and a use in this practical relationship in pursuit of a larger goal of a multi-polar world and pushing back against the West so in terms of this defense technological relationship I think despite um Chinese advances in its own defense industry Chinese academic still very much point to Russian strengths and basic research such as areas of Material Science mathematics physics Aerospace power efficiency polar exploration space science so on and so forth the but defense the bilateral military technological aspect of the relationship is viewed as complementary to other aspects of the sino-russian military political relationship and the sino-russian military operational relationship which I've touched on just previously and this defense technological relationship is viewed as being in terms of arm cells in terms of Defense technology transfers and more recently having shifted and perhaps progressed to r d collaboration and the defense technological field as well in terms of arm cells these have as I said ebbden flowed over time depending on political context and also Russian willingness to export and Chinese need for Russian exports they have primarily focused on aircraft air defense systems engines missiles Radars and sensors and to a lesser extent um some capability and Technologies in the naval domain but over half of all of China's arms export imports from Russia have been in the area of engines of various types and of course in aircraft and missile defense systems the armed Stills have declined in recent years um due as I mentioned due to a lack of need from the Chinese side for Russian capabilities and also because of a lack of trust on the Russian side following years of Chinese reverse engineering of ex-armed exports to China by Chinese defense companies but arm Stills have formed an important source of technology for Russia for Chinese defense industry and they have of course also served as an important source of funding and foreign currency for the Russian military industrial complex over time so perhaps this decline in arms sales that we're seeing at the moment might just be a little bit of a pause I'll talk a little bit about that in just a second the defense technological relationship is um developing as I said from a one-sided one where the flow is very much of Technology from Russia to China to when we're Chinese um academics really view this one of equal learning where there's a greater balance of power between the two countries and their defense technological abilities China's economic and technological arises allowed China to push back to what one Chinese academic has referred to as Russian chauvinism in the defense technological relationship and China and Russia or uh or have been or were until very recently perhaps moving forward to a relationship based on procurement of weapon systems and equipment and components to one of Cooperative r d and Joint manufacturing as well and an example of that would be perhaps joint cooperation on the development of emerging and disruptive Technologies for jewel-ee's purposes or as was mentioned publicly uh joint cooperation on the research and development of a missile early warning system um I think it is important to note though that on that last Point um that was heavily covered in the news but there's not really much sense of progress on that type of r d project so understanding where exactly that currently is in its phase of progress is is quite difficult to a certain publicly uh or at least from public sources so we there is an element here of Hope or there was an element of Hope from recent Chinese uh coverage of this defense technological relationship but there are also of course obstacles to this um deepening or to deepening ties in in this bilateral relationship and some things here that that should be pointed out is that there are still areas of Defense technology that China would like to acquire from Russia that Russia has uh withheld uh in terms of Defense related arms transfers from Russia to China thing for example of the latest uh and more most advanced of Russia's air defense systems or the most advanced of Russia's fighter aircraft in that sense I think there has been continued mistrust in the um the the military technological relationship uh Chinese academics or one Chinese academic that wrote about this and kind of tacitly acknowledged this concern on the Russian Side recent in recent years about China's past history of reverse engineering and taking advantage of Russian defense technological intellectual property by saying that some chinese-made weapons have similarities but russian-made weapons and Technical genes which was a really flowery and poetic way of saying we've stolen and copied some of your technology and actually quite a lot in the past um I think there's also so that that provides an obstacle I think the second obstacle may have been in the past that Russia as an arms exporter may have been nervous about China's increasing manufacturing capabilities and whether or not China's defense industry could in the future potentially compete with China with Russia for certain arms exports markets if Beijing did decide to ramp up production for arms exports in particular but you know in general whilst these might still be theoretical obstacles to deepening defense technological ties between the two countries I think the war in Ukraine has really thrown a spanner in some of the in some of these obstacles and may actually present China with some opportunities Russia's status as an arms exporter is likely to change following Russia's illegal war of aggression in Ukraine and so perhaps this sensitivity around arms export markets might actually also weaken as a result Russia is of course also becoming a junior partner in this bilateral relationship so um as you know although we're still unsure of just how the war in Ukraine is going to impact Russia Science and Technology strikes and abilities it is possible that China well I think it's likely that China is now becoming a technological power in that bilateral relationship that it's tilting more in China's favor um and also because of Russia's overall economic position China might also find itself in um an advantageous spot to potentially demand the transfer or sale of military technology that Russia has been withholding up to now from China taking advantage of Russia's overall weaker position I think we should be careful however to note that there are also challenges here for China I mean Pavel has spoken well about the frustrations perhaps at the at the elite level I think um I agree with that um I think there have also been demands um from um public reporting at least that Russia has requested China um to help with defense technological and material assistance uh throughout the war and that Beijing of course as we've noted recently has been warned by the U.S publicly against this multiple uh times uh most recently um just uh in the last few weeks I think the U.S government has said that it's investigating concerns that Chinese soes may have been supplying some military related Goods to Russia throughout the war in addition to a closer trading relationship between the two but details on what this exactly is and where the Chinese whether the Chinese government was conscious of this or not I think are still unclear but Beijing I think does really have to walk a fine line here between balancing and maintaining its relationship Without Limits uh quote unquote with Russia um which was once from its perspective also a potentially promising defense technological partner and on the other hand ensuring that this relationship doesn't negatively impact China's own national interests and through for example risking secondary sanctions and I think that's a very real concern and yes this overall relationship is not likely to change or to go away very very drastically in the near future as I said that bigger picture remains of U.S China's strategic rivalry that that Beijing will be factoring this relationship into um but on the other hand Beijing doesn't tend to act in anybody else's interests other than its own so here I think um you know it's going to be interesting to see over the next year exactly how Beijing is able to maneuver through this relationship its relationship with United States which Pablo rightly said it is trying to put a floor under I don't think this is between the US and China at all I think we we should be very very cautious about this China economically and politically coming out of a three years of zero coveted policies is finding itself in a very precarious position um you know we saw protests large-scale protests in Chinese cities um at the end of last year which caused the CCP to revert on its uh a zero Dynamic zero covid uh policy we've also said seen in the 20th party Congress that um she noted that the international and external environment to China is becoming increasingly critical and hostile to China and so there's a lot of PR that needs to be made up here from China's perspective to to um reverse some of the negative impacts of China's external relations that have developed over the last few years so I see this plus the the willingness to to um to put a floor in the U.S relationship with China under to put a floor into the bilateral U.S and China relationship as a positive but on the other hand that doesn't change the overall strategic view that China has of of uh the next five to ten years and what that looks like so I I note I just like to end on a note of caution there um there are of course other things that we can talk about here with regards to impacts of um the war of in Ukraine on the Russian China relationship and potentially also China's calculations for um future uh contingencies around Taiwan but perhaps it's best to leave those for the for the Q a as well if others are interested and I'll leave it at that thanks Maya yeah I think that really gives us a good picture of the security relationship it's certainly becoming um you know much more symbiotic much more much less um asymmetric than it previously was a couple decades ago and we'd love to get into some of the other things you you discussed in the in the Q a so um let's go over to Sergey now and I think we're going to kind of test pavel's hypothesis um our Chinese and Russian relations in Africa and Central Asia are really kind of running on separate tracks um maybe with occasional alignment so Sergey um thanks for joining us and I believe you have some slides you were gonna gonna show uh yes uh good morning John and uh good morning from freezing Edmonton Canada uh John uh one question for you how can we pull up my slides should I do it myself uh uh let me uh yes let me let you share the screen sorry yeah I was trying to navigate you know what actually let me just share my screen if you don't mind um because I have it here so and uh ah we are not on your first slide so there we go Um can everyone see the slides yeah okay and I'm gonna I'm going to um make sure that they're and uh slideshow view so all right all right and just say next slide Sergey sorry yeah that's true oh yeah yeah I'll do that uh yes so good morning once again and uh today I will be talking about uh China Russia interactions or lack of in thereof in uh Central Asia and Africa so uh John could we go to the next one please uh yes and this is a brief agenda what um I will be covering today so first I will talk about uh China and Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa uh in terms of the main achievements problems and uh some prospects uh secondly uh and I will be paying a marginal attention to this and later I will explain why uh no no later I will be talking about uh Russia also in uh Central Asia and South in and sorry sub-Saharan Africa uh and um I will talk about some of the uh some of the most recent developments and uh Russia's tools uh the main instruments that Russia has been using in uh trying to maybe promote its genders or maybe clinging to the uh messages of the past when operating these regions and finally in the final analysis I will talk about whether we can talk about um whether it is legitimate to refer uh to Russia and China a relation for collaboration in the region as China and Russia or maybe they're running their uh separate tracks so in brief in short I agree with what Bible said about Russia and China and Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa but now I'll give uh some general uh some general details about that and could we go to the next one please excellent uh so uh basically uh even though uh Central Asia and Africa sub-Saharan I'm referring to sub-Saharan Africa mainly are located in a very different uh parts of the world so geographically they are disconnected though there are many qualities there may many intrinsic characteristics that put a lot of uh connections or kind of bridges between these two regions especially for China and to some extent uh to Russia so first and foremost both the regions uh build a strategic and critical naturally resources that are essential for uh for different sites different types of manufacturing as well as satisfying needs of China in terms of critical some critical resources uh the second thing the second important element here is that these regions both of them share very high potential including Ian production of green energy the third aspect is that both regions build a perfect geographic location and thus are of strategic interest of great interest from logistical point of view unfortunately this visual image does not uh show does not demonstrate the Third Kind of Route which is the polar Silk Road but um we are primarily interested in these two aspects and of course for China both for China and Central Asia especially when we are referring to and this is particularly important when it comes to Central Asia it is a matter of domestic uh and internal security so basically this this macro region uh plays a strategic role to a lesser extent of course uh sub-Saharan Africa but uh it is also important I will talk about its importance uh in just a couple of minutes uh could we go to the next one please uh so let me first start with uh Chinese achievements and Chinese progress uh in uh Central Asia in this macro region so here instead of going into other or further detail let me just uh share this uh visual image uh which is a juxtaposition or a kind of a comparison of uh 2022 and 2021 in terms of uh overall uh uh growth in trade turnover between China and uh and uh Central Asian countries uh so the first uh the first and the most lucrative trade relationships are between China and Kyrgyzstan followed by Turkmenistan Tajikistan Kazakhstan and then Uzbekistan so we can see that uh Chinese and woman in terms of trade in terms of uh businesses it is growing it is increasing and uh the nature what is quite interesting here the nature of Chinese involvement uh in uh Central Asia from business and economic point of view it is also changing so it is kind of shifting from uh pure uh from dealing uh in the realm in the industry of nature of the resources uh to uh further activities and small uh and medium-sized Enterprises which is quite quite challenging quite remarkable quite interesting I would say could we go to the next one please uh but uh in Central Asia Chinese uh facing a number of uh challenges some challenges are more uh pressuring some more severe others are less important but still they uh do play a certain role at least they did play certain role uh just a couple of years uh during the acute stage of the Syrian Civil War and developments in Libya so one of the main challenges that Chinese facing in the macro region here in say in uh Central Asia is uh growing xenophobia according to multiple reports uh despite massive uh economic Investments despite uh some notable and noticeable infrastructure projects that a Chinese undertaken in the region uh the public perception of China has been on the decrease and uh the year 2019 I was doing a research I actually published a paper some time ago uh with China monitor uh in Jamestown about activities of Chinese private security companies in Central Asia the year 2019 was marked by the uh Kazakh by some observers by some Central Asian observers as the year of xenophobia uh in Central Asia and sometimes on some occasions this xenophobia took openly a radical openly acute forms so China is a series in Chinese uh both the Chinese State and the Chinese businesses are serious they're worried about uh tangible assets uh that uh China has in this macro region and the second uh the second uh challenge is the fear of the threat of uh terrorism uh which of course is uh it plays Far lesser role than uh just xenophobia why because uh basically it is uh well according to many uh estimates according to many estimates uh the uh uh fear of the threat of terrorism has significantly subsided since uh 2015-2016 and moreover some uh Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan which despite all the uh political reforms but despite all the domestic reform Still Remains a police state and many things many spheres of public life are still heavily controlled by the government so basically uh the fear of terrorism even though it might appear on the surface it doesn't really uh create this such a menace for uh the Chinese uh so what is this solution what kind of solution does China pursue our Solutions how does China pursue in the region so first the traditional quite typical no interference in public affairs approach uh which uh has been working quite well for uh China at least from image perspective uh also Chinese as it was demonstrated on the previous slide China is increasing uh its investment trade and business activities uh both within the region as well as with a certain uh countries and uh the third solution is related to uh security uh aspects security domain uh we wish we can uh Define which we can call conditionally either military or paramilitary cooperation so starting from uh basically early 2000s but then the activities increased of course China has uh has had several notable uh during paramilitary exercises with uh Kazakh tajik uh curious and on other governments the second important aspect that needs to be admitted here is arms and web and supplies frequently China does this uh either on created or completely free of charge which is quite interesting because uh in the 1990s and uh in the mid until maybe the mid-2000s uh Central Asia was viewed as a kind of an area as a um where the following magazine was applied uh Russia's Securities so Russia was the main security provider while China was uh heavily investing and doing kind of business trade and uh things and well uh moves related to economics now the the the uh situation is rapidly changing especially after the outbreak of uh the war in Russia's unprovoked war of regression against Ukraine then of course it's a basis or a rider not military base but rather it makes us to speak about security facilities that uh Chinese are trying to implement a set in uh the gigistan as a country that is yeah no no not yet as a country that um is perhaps most in dangerous uh in danger sorry from the security point of view given its proximity strategic Geographic proximity to some of the main centers of regional destabilization and of course the last one the last element is the use of the private security contractors private security companies now I'm working but basically I have already submitted a paper for uh Jamestown that uh discusses in depth uh with some by the way I took interviews from some notable uh uh Security Experts uh from Central Asia and working on Central Asia including those who leave who are Nationals of Uzbekistan and other countries so who know the environment uh first-handed the use of private security contractors and companies in uh the macro region although uh of course Chinese actions here may be a bit constrained because in many countries public perception runs are completed against the use of any forms of security assistance especially especially even the image in public perception of private security contractors this may work well and John could we go to the next one uh this may work relatively well in such a country as Kyrgyzstan which is heavily indebted to China but in other countries again based on the X based on opinions of experts that I communicated with that I talked about I talked with uh you know Uzbekistan in Kazakhstan uh it will let alone the local authorities they are completely against any form or any forms of security assistance that take for a form or shape of private security contractors or private security companies and of course this image has stagnated has aggravated further after the outbreak of Russia's war against Ukraine uh when uh even sometimes experts they confuse private military companies private security companies and private military and security companies so in Public Image in public perception private security companies may take a form uh in a way tend to mount a private military companies or rather quasi-private military companies that Russia has been using since at least 2014 in different theaters so this table shows some of the uh activities of some of the private security companies operate in Kyrgyzstan uh again uh of course the atmosphere is completely uh kind of is not uh um is not transparent it's uh so it's very very hard to ascertain or what exactly they're doing there in which numbers but uh based on some bits and pieces of information it's possible to kind of deduce some of the some of these facts could we go to the next one uh and um a very I was rather somewhat a similar situation is taking place in uh sub-Saharan Africa actually and now uh right now my next piece a large paper for Jamestown on Russia's oh sorry on Chinese activities um in a sub-Saharan African anglophone part of Africa and the next is another piece will be about activities of Chinese private security contractors Ian uh francophone Africa uh so uh here are a couple of just interesting facts about uh the extent and the level of uh Chinese uh involvement uh in this macro region so China is the key investor in sub-Saharan Africa in general uh the top five African destinations for uh Chinese uh well in some reports they called foreign direct investment but let's call them this way for 2020 working a Democratic Republic of Congo South Africa Ethiopia and Nigeria then 84 percent of China's belt and Road Investments are and this is very important this I think is uh this will play a very key role I would say in the development in the trajectory of the development and the use of private security contractors in the region uh Investments are in medium to high risk countries uh another one is between 2007 2020 uh China's two main overseas Development Bank Banks invested uh some 23 billion in infrastructure projects across Africa uh by August 2022 so very recent data China's official Belgium Road uh website uh listed uh 52 African countries uh taking part in the building Belgian Road initiative in 2020 the number of Chinese workers in Africa uh uh was down as compared to uh 2019 but uh in fact it was mainly due to covet and Chinese workers as well as Chinese final Chinese uh tangible assets being placed in Africa uh opposes one of the key challenges for uh for China and I'll talk about this in just a second and what is also interesting uh with regards to sub-Saharan Africa is that uh there is an interesting Trend that is taking place there in a way maybe uh somewhat similar to what we are seeing what we are observing in Central Asia but from slightly different perspective which is which which is red as Chinese money Western Security it doesn't work uh the way it used to in many ways this uh could be traced to our successful missions in psychell uh G5 region I wrote a PS2 pieces actually on this with Russia allegedly trying to uh get inside the macro region but never actually uh doing this and to the extent that uh it was uh it was projected or it was theorized by uh Western experts because there is a lot of uh bottlenecks and hurdles uh when jumping in this region in many ways this goes hand in hand with Russia's unsuccess Ian Mozambique where the Wagner group suffered accumulating defeat uh uh a year and a half I think ago and as a result basically the local authorities uh commission Services of South African contractors and uh bad things in the uh in Cabo Delgado province which is handsomely endowed with natural gas but a very very complex from operational point of view in terms of uh political risks could we go to the next slide please uh and also here uh here is the summary of uh the kind of the main challenges that and solutions also that uh Chinese using Chinese implementing in its operations in uh sub-Saharan Africa so the first and here uh perhaps one of the main problems is the fear of terrorism and extremism uh which is uh which constitutes a much much larger problem than uh in uh Central Asia of course in many ways because institutions here the local institutions in many of these countries are by far weaker than uh in uh Central Asia and uh the Jamestown Foundation its terrorist monitor has done a fantastic job uh discussing and describing all the developments uh breaking down all the developments in Africa by Geographic principles and what we can learn what we can see from this multiple analysis is that the situation across Africa is aggro weight and stagnate in fact by by the way you are one of the most recent uh reports by the United Nations It also says that uh the uh the threat uh the spectrum of terrorism extremism is increasing and uh what is worth is that uh terrorists and extremist activities are tightly needed with the second element that I'll talk about in just a second is a mandatory and organized crime uh which in uh sub-Saharan Africa represents uh a huge challenge for instance uh one of the most one of the most I would say widespread uh means that the locals used to extract money from the Chinese are is kidnapping or are kidnappings for uh Ransom uh now when I'm working on this paper for about sub-Saharan Africa basically uh the instances of Chinese uh workers Chinese Engineers Chinese Nationals at large being abducted for ransom Ian uh sub-Saharan Africa uh it's uh substantial to significant uh one of the main problems here is the belief of many Africans or many representatives of local organized criminal groups is that all the Chinese companies are uh wealthiest crisis and one can get a lot of money by um abducting their uh Personnel while in fact well many Chinese companies actually operate in Africa they're trying to cut down the costs and uh they do not commission or procure Services of professional uh private security contractors uh and some solutions so basically the first solution is in many ways uh uh very very similar uh to what we see to what we can observe in uh Central Asia's trade investment and not interference in uh the domestic affairs of uh local countries one of the and by the way this uh this gives a very good uh very uh positive I would say outcome for China in fact uh the Opera barometer says regularly says that uh public perception of China in Africa is very good in fact and this is quite interesting that it is especially particularly good among uh the the uh the African youth it is almost as good basically almost similarly good as the perception of the United States so basically China and United States are the best perceived uh large actors large players in sub-Saharan uh sub-Saharan uh in this macro region uh the second important tool is UN mandated uh missions where China is uh trying to kind of uh play uh uh play a certain role and it's enrollment and these operations is increasing so Chinese are also working on this component unlike Russia by the way uh whose contribution to U.N missions in uh sub-Saharan uh sub-Saharan Africa in this Mac region has been minimal uh and of course the activities of regular group are perceived or real they do not uh definitely add any credibility uh to Russia or I do not influence in a positive way it's image and the final thing the last aspect here is uh the uh activities of private security contractors I won't go into the detail here I want my paper to be published first so I don't want to kind of provide extra information some of the pieces have not been corroborated so I'll just uh I'll just uh kind of uh articulate uh importance of this uh one could you go to the next slide please one though uh I could share with you one of the it's not mine the table is not mine I took it from another study uh the Chinese security companies operate in Africa which shows that we should demonstrate that in addition to land-based contractors China is also using some of the security providers that are authorized for maritime operations which I think is quite uh quite interesting quite uh telling and it's interesting I mean I haven't measured the rate of success or anything but unlike China Russia got into trouble in I believe 2013 or 20 20 I think I think it was 20 10 here sometime between 2010 2013 in Nigeria trying to do something related to these activities uh when the crew was busted and basically there was a real serious problem with uh Nigerian police and even the Nigerian government so um for Chinese at least for now this is this has been working quite well uh and uh so uh last last thing here could we go to the next slide please uh there are certain problems and there will be certain problems with Chinese Youth and Chinese um potential Reliance on private security contractors or even a military bases in um in Africa so first of all the African public opinion is strongly against uh China or any other country including Russia by the way uh at least in major countries I'm not talking about the Central African Republic or some price States but rather uh in major players public opinion Iran's uh strongly contrary strongly against uh any major power uh using African territories uh to spread and promote the use of their private military security companies or establishing military bases uh they use uh also the use of private security contractors at least in my opinion uh might in a way contradict China's image building approach uh which is a typical arrests on promotion of power trade business ties economic collaboration and of course the last uh State the last element here is that uh the more in case uh China chooses to use a private security contractors to a greater extent uh basically this will uh this might put them on the public display and this is one of the things that uh the Chinese political regime uh would want to uh would want to avoid so this brings me to the last Point um the last Point basically yes oh sorry no not the last Point uh John Doe do I still have time or should I do right now sorry you're muted ah yeah if you want to maybe just say a few more words and then we can kind of quickly go to q a so okay yeah so to the last one to the last slide so basically uh yes uh so China and Russia or China will be Russia so basically uh in uh key areas including uh a business and trade uh Russia is not a rival to China in any way in neither in sub-Saharan Africa nor in Central Asia Russia's rule has been on the decrease even in Central Asia well before uh its war of aggression against Ukraine today it's even lower and I think that in such countries especially in Kazakhstan the largest and the main player it will be uh decreasing in terms of soft power of course again the uh the Gap is also widening and and not in Russia's favor and in terms of military power Russia's images getting a rapid detained it uh due to its multiple unsuccesses multiple failures in Ukraine and we'll see what is going to happen uh later with the element of uh more advanced uh Western weaponry and what what this means is based basically China and Russia are unlikely in my opinion again to pursue any joints actions in Africa and or Central Asia that would be of strategic nature so there might be some uh temporary ad hoc uh cooperation or engagements but I don't think I don't believe that uh China and Russia will be uh pursuing any strategic actions in the uh in this region and most importantly this is one interesting thought that I find found uh in a work of one Russian academic uh who critically assessed uh connections and developments of Russia Chinese ties he said he opened the road that in fact the most crucial aspect is that from cultural civilizational point of view China does not see Russia as an Asian power uh and uh whatever Russia does basically it's image in China will be very very different from what it really wants to achieve and this thank you and sorry for taking more time oh that's really good uh Sergey and I you know um appreciate that kind of granular level of research and looking at um the situation in Central Asia and Africa so I think it does kind of I'm coming away from this that it really is on two tracks uh the relationship between and there's um so I uh would like to just open it go straight into audience a question and answer because we have such a great um audience here with us today um and I want to we have a question here from Joseph Bosco that I want to go to first um oh and I guess a quick housekeeping um thing for Q a you can either type a question in the Q a box uh on your Zoom module or uh raise your virtual hands and ask a question in person um so let's go to um Joseph Bosco's question first um and he asked is there any sense of how Russia's war in Ukraine has affected China's plans for aggression against uh Taiwan uh Maya I think this has your name written all over it things um look I think there's no evidence in public source that this has either shifted a timeline forward or um or or back um I think there's only one person who knows what those plans are and that Xi Jinping and that will not be discussed publicly so I'm wary to make any kind of predictions about that and I don't think we necessarily should but um but I think there are there have been interesting discussions about what the pla might be learning as a result of Russia's performance in the war in Ukraine and although the relate the the comparison between uh the war in Ukraine and the Taiwan contingency are very different there are some general lessons that maybe learned the question here is are the lessons that we think the Chinese might be learning from Russia's performance in the war in Ukraine the same as the lessons that the Chinese are actually learning about the performance from the performance of Russia in the war in Ukraine and that I think is something that we still need to watch for moving forward it's clear that you know there's been some writing um in Chinese sources about things like um the difference uh in a Taiwan contingency in terms of resupply for the Taiwanese that will be problematic and so we've seen some evidence that there will be a greater emphasis on targeting an activity around and of taiwan's eastern coast where if any resupply would be coming through that would be most likely but on the other hand we know that that has been a plan for a while now with pla exercises actually mocking up certain small ports on on taiwan's east coast and capabilities being developed to Target East the taiwan's east coast and of course pla Navy activity along taiwan's East Coast so again is that really new or is that just a reinforcement of lessons that they already you uh from the uh from from you know modernizing and looking at a Taiwan contingency which is the number one contingency that the pla has been preparing for over time there's also of course political and economic lessons that could be drawn from this in terms of response uh Western unified response to uh to uh Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine um how uh lessons about um economic resilience in China's side lessons about decreasing dependencies on China's side and abilities to um to counter sanctions if that is the case um there will of course be lessons about how long does unity in the west actually lusts as well I mean if this is a question of short-term pain for a Taiwan successfully successfully um achieving a reunificative forced to reunification with Taiwan or by economics sanctions lead to Chinese domestic economic pain and over a few years then perhaps that's worth it um rather than you know uh if at least this this core interest has been delivered upon from the ccp's perspective but overall there hasn't been I think this huge shift in Risk calculus from the plas or ccp's perspective that I can point to as a result of this but it is something to watch great um anything to add there Pablo or Sergey um there's always talk right or There Was Fear I think before Russia invaded Ukraine right that um Russia and China might kind of sync up their actions right and force the U.S into a two-front or even you know if you add in Iran and North Korea multi-front contingency but obviously China didn't you know Russia went ahead and China didn't uh was there is there disappointment in Moscow that that China didn't kind of shake things up a little more in Asia uh I think looking from Moscow they you know every Genie step in uh escalating tensions in Asia is a disappointment um I think Russia really counts very much on uh the second front uh appearing in Asia Russia is quite surprised with the strength of the western Coalition not only in Europe but also spread into Asia there is a lot of attention in Moscow now to the new uh Japanese military Doctrine into a good changes in Japanese military strategy I was very surprised about the volume of commentary on this matter because again Ukraine shouldn't dominate dominates everything whether it be General more General note I think China is much better learning lessons from Russia's disasters in Russia itself change the studied very carefully in the collapse of the Soviet Union and many other things and I think China now is studying real lessons of this war in a much more consistent way and the Zen Russian generals Russian politicians are able to yeah yeah I completely agree with what Bible said and uh just uh just to add uh to this uh it's been uh too many disappointments for Russia including the Balkans where Russia was really looking forward to uh stagnation maybe even a small uh paramilitary conflict or some kind of uh hybrid conflict which never happened moreover there are talks that uh survey might join anti-russian uh sanctions we'll see where it is goes but I think another knife in the back is Russian propaganda uh uh cheerleader Jose so yeah I I completely agree with what Pyle said great um we'll move on to the next question it is a really interesting point um about the impact on Ukraine on Japan's security thinking and you know Japan I think it's remarkable this uh overhauling it's security Doctrine uh and the the sort of amount that Japan has moved I think what's really interesting there is that we saw at aipac right um uh kashida fumio right and uh Xi Jinping Matt right and they actually put out a five-point consensus on improving relations right but then at the same time you know Japan took these very strong steps of strengthening its military is now just signing on to U.S um semiconductor sanctions or semiconductor export controls so when I look at Japan in Asia it's kind of is sort of uh you know speak softly and carry a big stick so there may be some lessons there I guess for Washington that's my one editorial Point let's go over here to back to the other questions and we have a great question I think I'm going to butcher this name but from um Gregor kaczynski's Kaczynski who asked um do you agree that Russia is losing Central Asia to China and does the current Russian regime see it that way uh so Sergey let's go go back to you and have you uh tackle this one oh yeah that's that's a really great question in fact uh before the outbreak award um Russia's war against Ukraine um I read an article by uh Sergey karagana who used to be an advisor uh to uh well Russian presidents and probably still serves in some capacity uh because whatever he was saying he was kind of uh talking about the war or uh kind of that the war is immediate and it's going to happen very soon a big war in Europe and did happen so but uh in any case what he wrote was quite interesting he said that uh well we should really abdicate from the idea of Russia being uh or playing a certain role in Central Asia as he said we don't need Central Asia we can basically uh agree with China in a way taking over Central Asia he said that one of the main problems of the Soviet Union uh one of the main at least to him one of the main uh factors that led to the collapse of the USSR was that uh Russia well the Soviet Union in Russia was investing its resources uh investing its effort in those territories that either never really belonged to Russia or were only extracting or distracting Russia from its uh activities on other France and that was that came to me as a surprise when karaganov himself said that basically Russia doesn't need Central Asia if if uh China is so much interested in Central Asia Let It Be Chinese let us let us allow China to be the main uh the dominating power inside Central Asia which will be the main means for us to avoid I mean for us for Russians to avoid conflict uh with China and uh kind of um debuted completely to discern uh to the pivot to the east policy which was kind of telling and I think it uh in many ways or should be answering this question so yes Russia yes uh withdrawing from Central Asia there are objective and subjective things here uh in many ways I mean as I said before the role of Russian Central Asia was on the decline starting basically from the early 1990s and even during the Soviet time uh in this starting from the late 70s that was one of the one of the most problematic uh well aside from the Baltic states of course republics uh the one of the main problematic subjects or areas uh in the Soviet Union internal policies so I think that morally Russians are kind of in the Kremlin in Moscow they are kind of fine with or agreeing that uh it is China that should be playing the key role in Central Asia I might be wrong but uh maybe Parable or uh Maya something to add wow okay that's that's a remarkable uh Insight um Sergey um I think you know um that's that's fascinating um yeah I mean maybe that so it sounds like Russia is almost willing to make sort of accommodations to China's strategic interests but not necessarily am I reading too much into that but like they're almost willing to make special accommodations for China um I guess that makes um ah so um let's go on to one one more question I think before we close out for today and I I thank all the panelists for being generous with their time um I think this is is a a good question about um India's role in all this right so um you know is that how does that factor into this relationship right um and um because we know that India has has a decent relationship with Moscow right and there's the legacy of that whole relationship right but then there's the relationship with China um so how does that kind of triangle um factor in any thoughts on that uh maybe Pavel if we can maybe go to you to start yes it is a very difficult triangle and for that matter one uh evidence is that every time we see tensions uh clashes or the clashes between uh China and India one would suppose Russia is ideally positioned position to mediate to bring them together to come with some initiatives not a single time and I think the lack of trust in both China and India and Russian mediation is probably the main explanation but overall Russia is really caught in between the traditional ties with Indian and strategic partnership with China and he really cannot find a good way to balance these these two commitments and the adding up compromising both much the same way as Russia ties with Vietnam as weakened very very clearly partly because China was never pleased with that and partly because Russia really cannot offer much to Vietnam much the same way in Russia's ties with India I think there are now more weaknesses than strengths and probably the even the arms expert which used to be one of the backbones of these relations is said to be much reduced because Russia just cannot offer India anything of um of interest and because India probably would think twice about Russia as a reliable answer player I'm not in India it's just a really quick intervention I'm not an indie expert so I can't I can't protect it um to speak for uh or or any real Authority on this issue but maybe just one consideration on that arms exports front which I think is a really important element here of um of kind of the China India tensions as well which have been uh flaring out from time to time along their disputed border over the last couple of years particularly during copit as well as we saw I mean here the question is um there is I think a growing concern about um you know the the capabilities of the of the Indian Armed Forces Viv Rising tensions with China and so how does now conundrum with a dependency on arms exports firm Russia is going to be solved in in the next few years I think is something to really watch we have seen China move some of its equipment more to the Western theater uh in their longest border uh with uh with India and although India is not the main contingency that China's concerned about the plas preparing for it certainly is I think featuring into this concern in China as well of a potentially a potential situation where China needs to look both East in a Taiwan contingency potentially also West so there I think the issue of India has moved slightly up in China's considerations of potential areas or flashpoints or areas of concern for the pla to focus on um but really I think here the question the bigger problem is going to be on on India's side as well of how to deal with this dependent relationship on on the Russian arms export market and where to go from there foreign and just from my side uh just uh one quick remark so I'm more interested in business and economic ties between India and uh Russia and uh specifically three main things first uh the oil price cap because just uh two weeks ago uh uh in one uh in one uh in one outlet and then in other outlets and Russian Outlets it was said that Indian government is considering uh joining uh basically de facto during investment sanctions against uh Russian oil producers if the price of oil exceeds 60 dollars per barrel which is quite interesting uh uh so Indians are only interested in purchasing Russian oil uh with a significant huge I would say even discount uh so how things will play out if uh Russia's oil is above 60 probably India might want to join uh the anti-russian sanctions and then uh why China could not do the the same maybe behind uh under the scenes but still quite interesting the second aspect in my opinion also very interesting is uh related to the decision uh to trade Ian uh National currencies uh the main problem here is that uh in uh the trade balance between Russia and India there is a huge huge imbalance so basically Russia is selling in the uh well given the uh the uh of the amounting experts of oil uh Russia was selling a thing I believe it was uh 23 billion uh and India was selling to Russia up to 2.3 billion something like this so for end date makes uh very little sense uh to continue uh trading with Russia on these terms and extend or expand uh their uh trade relations and the third aspect is uh uh cooperation in the domain of uh defense industrial complex actually it became known just a couple of weeks ago that now one of the uh submarines that was uh was to have been repaired by Russia and delivered to India uh didn't didn't work out why because of the economic sanctions on Russia and all these things so for India in many ways collaborating with Russia extension stay or if they expand even makes very very little sense so basically I'm fantastic um some great insights there um yeah I mean it makes me think back to 2014 after Crimea right and we heard a lot about Russia pivoting to Asia right and they were gonna deepen economic ties with India Japan South Korea Vietnam southeast Asia and China and it seems to have become really just a pivot to China mainly so but um um I guess um I want to thank um our panelists today uh I want to give them a chance I guess any last words um to say before we head away things to watch for in 2023 um I guess uh Pavel Maya Sergey any last words great all right well thank you so much you know really appreciate it um you can uh view this uh video on our website uh jamestown.org um or our YouTube page um and um you can read a Sergey and and Pablo's writings um on China brief in Jamestown uh and Maya's uh double I double s and and hopefully we'll get her to write for China brief soon so um and uh you know really thank everyone for taking their time this has been a fantastic panel and I learned a lot uh speaking to you all so have a good weekend and and thank you all thank you so much thank you Take Care thank you bye
tm3P3gXxJyE,"China, the United States and the Pacific Island Countries","The Jamestown Foundation is proud to present a webinar on “China, the United States and the Pacific Island Countries” on August 4 at 10:00 AM (EDT).

This spring, Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited eight Pacific Island countries, a diplomatic tour that highlighted China’s growing influence in the region. Through the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has emerged as a significant infrastructure development funder in the Pacific. China is also an increasingly consequential regional security actor, recently signing an agreement with the Solomon Islands including provisions for security assistance, and potentially paramilitary or military deployments. Finally, the Pacific Island countries remain central to the diplomatic contest between Beijing and Taipei, with the Solomon Islands and Kiribati switching recognition from Taiwan to China in late 2019. In response to China’s deepening engagement with the Pacific Island countries, the U.S and its allies, particularly Australia and New Zealand, have sought to re-engage with the region. In April, U.S. National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell led a high-level delegation that visited Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. In May, Fiji agreed to join the U.S. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework as an inaugural member. Last month, Vice President Kamala Harris virtually addressed the Pacific Islands Forum.

Editor-in-Chief, China Brief; China Program Manager, The Jamestown Foundation",1,i want to give everyone a second to trickle in here um all right well let's get started here um good morning i'm john espinoun editor-in-chief of china brief and china program manager at the jamestown foundation in washington d.c thanks everyone for joining us this morning for our webinar on china the united states and the pacific island countries obviously over the past week there's been a great deal of focus on taiwan but we're going to look at another area of the pacific today where the rivalry between the u.s and china has heated up of late which is the pacific island countries so this spring uh the solomon islands uh and china announced a security agreement this was followed by chinese foreign minister wang yiz tour of eight pacific island countries uh in may and june and during the tour uh foreign minister wong proposed a sweeping uh trade and security agreement uh with the ten countries in the region that have relations with beijing although the deal ultimately uh did not uh materialize um china did sign uh 52 uh bilateral uh agreements with countries uh in the specific island countries of course uh and in response to china's growing involvement in the region uh the us has recently uh prioritized its own high-level engagement with the pacific island countries uh president biden's asia securities are kirk campbell uh led a high-level delegation to the region and vice president kamala harris addressed the pacific islands forum and of course we know that competition involving china in the region isn't enough new uh it's home to several of taiwan's uh remaining uh diplomatic allies uh four of them uh but still i think the current competition uh the current geopolitical competition uh involving the us china and u.s allies such as australia uh is really taking it up another level uh at the same time other countries in the region have expressed very real concerns uh with transnational uh challenges particularly economic development climate change and public health issues okay we've got two fantastic uh panelists here to talk us through these issues uh we have ambassador c stephen mcgann who is the founder of the stevenson group uh international consulting firm and an affiliate at the center for australia new zealand and pacific studies at georgetown university uh importantly he has a great deal of direct experience in the region as a high-level uh us diplomat he was ambassador to the pacific uh to the republics of fiji naru kiribati and the kingdoms of tonga and tuvalu from 2008 to 2011. we also have with us cleo pascal who's a non-resident fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies and was for many years an associate fellow at the asia pacific program at chatham house in london and she's written extensively on this topic including in her capacity as the north america special correspondent for the sunday guardian okay with that um i'm going i've talked enough i'm going to turn it over to ambassador mcgann who's going to talk us through um how this intensifying geopolitical competition uh between the u.s and china looks to the countries in the region and how they see themselves in this shifting uh international landscape ambassador mcgann over to you and thanks so much for joining us this morning well john thank you very much for the introduction i'm exceptionally pleased to be on this panel today with cleo pascal my good friend and one of the things that's very difficult about being on a panel with cleo is that we agree on so many things so what i wanted to do this morning was to look at ways in which we can better contextualize what's going on uh in the relationships with within the big powers the u.s australia new zealand china as well as using today's topical situation regarding the question of taiwan and how that fits into the overall structure of our engagement in the pacific how pacific island countries view themselves and how they want to sort out the policy priorities in the region now by coincidence much of my observations today come from both being a observer of history and a participant at the same time as a practitioner so that most people don't realize that my actual first assignment in the foreign service in 1979 was to be part of the first cohort to the american institute in taiwan exactly at the time in which we began to implement the taiwan relations right back changing our recognition uh from uh from taipei to beijing now what's important about that is understanding the beginnings of taiwan's overall approach and engagement in the pacific and how pacific island countries have viewed taiwan now i mentioned uh taiwan being my first assignment but also coincided with the very first time i served as a duty officer was the night of the gaussian riots which was the call by the then fledgling taiwan independence movement for a greater separation between uh taiwan and uh and china or the people's republic of china to be exact and what we saw at that time was in very clear ways the at on a granular level uh the first implementation of time on relations act because uh as a junior officer i was also assigned to provide consular protection for the american life of the leader of the taiwan independence movement but that that night in gaochon also in very many ways was i always view as the first spark in the competition for diplomatic recognition because it also uh put beijing on notice that there were uh factors elements within taiwan that wanted to push for a much more autonomous independent status and while we talked about uh that initial engagement with taiwan i also served in the u.n working on uh issue issues such as a global ban on fish fish net drift and fishing uh which impacted upon the uh fishing practices of not just and but also taiwan in china more importantly as later on as director for the office of australia new zealand and pacific island affairs repeatedly met with representatives of taiwan on the margins of the pacific island forum post dialogue forum meeting and actually traveled in to taipei in 2007 to encourage taiwan to move away from direct support of pacific island country politicians and to begin funding broader development assistance programs i also my coincidence as the record also traveled to beijing to talk about their goals in the pacific in the aftermath of the 2006 uh solomon islands riots more so in preparation for my assignment as our ambassador mason silva i always like to draw attention to the fact that in my confirmation hearing statement i made it very very clear that we would continue to engage with representatives of taiwan both based in the taipei economic and cultural affairs office in supa as well as meeting with the dean of the diplomatic corps whenever i traveled to tarawa uh capital of carabas who by coincidence happened to also be the ambassador of taiwan to care of us so the point i'm really starting off with was that these were just not new elements in our pacific policy that we see today but a growing trend toward engaging pacific island countries in the dynamic of china and taiwan based on not only our regional goals but also the preferences of pacific island countries and pacific island countries made it very clear that while they were most of them were willing to comply with u.n uh general assembly resolution 2758 which transferred representation of china from the people's republic of china they were also very clear that the synagogue country saw taiwan as a legitimate pacific entity with interest in the region and a capable partner to provide development assistance and economic growth help beyond the competition for diplomatic recognition so i think we even see that manifested uh in just last month's pacific island forum meeting in which all the big powers were excluded from the meeting in suva including post-dialogue foreign partners uh precisely because the pacific island countries wanted to press their priorities for the region and their priorities for the region are based a lot on one key factor they do not want the united states and its strategic partners in the region to really have a policy against china but they want a policy that establishes priorities for the pacific and this is a very key in our understanding of how they engage with both uh with both entities uh the prc and taiwan and their relationship with us and so one of the things that we begin to see is that despite uh the competition for diplomatic recognition we see taiwan engaging in the comprehensive and uh progressive agreement for trans-pacific partnership we see taiwan as playing an important role in the pacific island leadership program that's actually sponsored by the east west center and most importantly uh because they're not un agencies taiwan has a has a role to play and supports organizations that are part of the council of uh the council regional organizations of the pacific or crop agencies and so when we start understanding uh this dynamic of how the pacific island countries view themselves how they are very clear that in their own minds that the multilateral organizations that pacific island countries create themselves also include territories representatives of different political parties uh within territories that it is not uncommon at all for pacific island countries to view taiwan as another pacific partner notwithstanding the strategic competition between the us and other powers in china but in fact what pacific island countries are trying to do is to as i said make sure that the overall objectives of the united states when it comes to meeting our national security goals also are consistent with the human security concerns of pacific island countries and this is manifested not only as we see in multilateral organizations is also seen and how the countries are freely associated states and as well as other micronesian countries in the north pacific uh view their overall status and particularly uh for the truly associated state countries that they see the kofa as the insufficient in its application to meet again their human security concerns uh and not as a wedge against china and so when they're fully associated states engage in dialogue with the united states over the status of the cofa their focus is on culprit implementation not necessarily on becoming a bulwark against china so the goal for the united states in this context has to be to ensure that pacific island countries do not view our engagement in the pacific are stepping up our game as a temporary phase and that we would just resort to where we were before which the united states clearly underplayed its hand in the pacific and that the pacific island countries want assurances that we're going to have a sustained diplomatic engagement that focuses on their priorities for development assistance and economic growth and that leads us to where we are today in the conversation trying to understand how pacific island countries articulate and navigate these strains of the pacific that they insist are not caused by them but in fact uh want to assert that their own rights to sovereignty their own rights and self-determination their own rights and decision-making on how they engage all the players in the pacific and with that uh brief introduction i'm going to stop here i'm sure we're going to have uh more time for uh questions for the audience as well as engagement between uh cleo and myself but i wanted to open today's discussion contextualizing where we are and understanding uh the competition uh with china and the region the role of taiwan and the perceptions of pacific island countries uh in that regard for these issues thank you thanks ambassador mcgann i think that gives us some really valuable uh insights into how these dynamics uh look from the point of view of the pacific island countries that i think uh needs to be you know more widely heard outside the region particularly probably here in in washington dc um all right well let's go over to you and cleo has some slides which i'm going to uh to share here uh with um uh cleo is going to talk about how the major external players uh see the uh see the situation uh in the region so um okay um all right cleo thank you thank you very much uh john and to to jamestown for for having this topic and to ambassador again uh for from whom i've learned so much and who has um shown what you can do if you're a diplomat in the field who actually uh cares about your job and and works hard and does things it's uh it makes an enormous difference and i'm very grateful for for what he's done and continues to do for the region and beyond um this is a little bit daunting uh because ambassador mcgann is here so i'm gonna do my best um i'm looking as mentioned at uh kind of what it what it's looking like from external players but as ambassador mcgowan said you need to understand what the perspectives are domestically in order for that to make any sense um and i'm going to look at two regions uh one is uh again as master mcgann mentioned the freely associated states which are the countries they're three countries that are that are the us's strongest allies on the planet these are three countries where independent countries who have handed over their defense and security to the united states to manage no other country has done that they rely completely on the united states for their defense and security and that is not by compulsion that is by choice and that choice can change uh and that's why it's so important that the agreement that underpins that relationship which is the compacts of free association which are currently up for renegotiation be resolved uh quickly and efficiently and to everybody's satisfaction the prime minister of the solomon islands uh manasseh sagavari uh surrounded by his recently arrived chinese police trainers next to the chinese ambassador to get us there we go oops we almost had it sure yep there we go thank you so um this is an enormous area that we're talking about so if you put uh the northeast bit of the united states up by hawaii you get it covers about 1 6 of the planet and there are over 20 different countries in the region it is also the front line between asia and the americas we know this from world war ii these are highly important locations and we're going to look specifically at one island or one atul within this zone uh yep next slide please which is kwajalein uh quadrilateral in the marshall islands um it you may think that it's it sounds like it's not really um in the middle of anything but it actually is right in the middle of everything highly strategic location um it is a small atoll it's in the marshall islands the marshall islands is one of these freely associated states that is in a compact or free association with with the united states the marshall islands recognizes taiwan and the marshall islands is no longer in the pacific island forum next slide uh the marshals and i'm going to go through a little bit of its history so you can get a sense of the the reality of the leadership in the region how strategically important they are so in the 17th and they were on their own technically coming from taiwan then in 17th 18th century had spain and after that uh in 1885 spain gave them to germany yeah that's fine you can leave it here germany lost them yep next slide yeah germany uh lost them after world war one to japan so that whole zone the zone that's now what are in a mostly compact or free association with the united states um was actually the japanese mandate after world war one so between the two wars uh japan um was the colonial power in the region and um it's that's why if you go to palau there are a lot of japanese loanwords they're they're japanese fishermen who married into local families and there was a a relatively kind of benign expansion of japanese influence during those years um next slide please this then as as the japanese empire started to uh kind of expand uh japan started talking about um this greater east asia co-prosperity sphere and the and the language that china uses now it's not accidental that it sounds familiar because uh china has looked at um strategic positioning and importance of the region and has was being promoted during that time by the japanese was the idea that you've got these colonials up in your right and left-hand corner of the uk and us in this case and they're the ones that are creating all the problems in the region and making life very miserable for the people of the islands next slide please yeah so if you just had it all under a japanese flag then uh the locals would be happy and peaceful and prosperous and uh poor uk and us would be miserable but you know who really cares and as that expansion was happening of course you ended up with um what's going to be commemorated this week which is the 80th anniversary the battle of guadalcanal where the u.s at great cost very high numbers of fighters had to liberate these islands next slide please and going back to kwajalein uh kwajalein was liberated in february 44. um it was one of the last great stands on the japanese side over 5000 japanese and koreans were killed in kwajalein this this is again remember very small location but highly strategically located um 177 americans were killed over a thousand wounded uh this is what the atoll looked like um after after that battle next slide please after world war ii this region kwajalein and this region that had been that japanese mandate went back to the u.n and the u.n handed it to the us as a trust territory this is one of the only strategic areas designated by the un in fact the only strategic area designated by the u.n and it was given to the u.s to manage as a location that was considered highly strategic next slide please the us used kwajalein as a military site and including in 1946 it was the command center for operation frost bikini actual next slide please and kwajalein is now the site of the uh ronald reagan missile defense uh test site it is still an active uh military site um this is just to yeah like uh yeah this is just to give a sense of that's fine you can leave it one nation among many that has uh to the compacts by choice this freely associated states these are highly contested and complicated locations the leaders of the region are very knowledgeable and they know the cost of failure um when when the marshall islands went independent um they decided to enter into these compacts of free association with the united states the two other countries are the federated states of micronesia pull out the agreement means that they can work in the us they can serve in the u.s military and in fact they're um they have uh sorry um they have they work in the u.s military at higher rates than the uh than in many u.s states uh they have a unique defense and security arrangement this is a huge return on investment for the us it underpins the entire us defense posture in asia this pushes the front line of u.s defense posture off of hawaii and off to the coast of asia the cost of the us being in that region was extremely high the costs and lives and treasure and the cost of getting it back would be enormous um without it japan the philippines and australia and south korea become very hard to defend this is how important this region is to the united states yep next slide please china knows this and there was a book that was written in 2011 by jian yang who ended up in the new zealand parliament this is a whole other story um when about how the pacific islands play into china's branch strategy and he wrote china's growing involvement in the south pacific is part of china's growing involvement worldwide an isolated study without understanding china's branch strategy and overall foreign policy goals can be misguided and he said that the grant strategy goals were based on china's concept of comprehensive national power which was adopted in the 1990s and has constituted the foundation of china's foreign policy next slide please how comprehensive is that comprehensive national power we got a sense of it uh in 2014 in a speech given by xi jinping to inaugurate china's national security commission he said the nsu would integrate territorial security military security economic security cultural security social security technology security information security ecological security resource security and nuclear security this is how they go in to cut to the pacific islands this is incredibly important they go in and completely comprehensive way rule is next slide i think you're back okay can you can you hear me out okay yes yes okay great okay uh next slide please so um when china goes into the pacific countries it the goal is to shift it from goodwill to support to dependency there's a whole range of techniques that it uses in a kind of unrestricted warfare way commercials infrastructure casinos for money laundering high level visits everything you'd expect and uh the result is that in 2019 we saw two countries caribbeas and the solomons switching from taiwan to china next slide please we're going gonna take a look quickly at solomon's because that's i think what brought a lot of people here today um uh they switched in uh in 2019 as mentioned but it one of the provinces while we get to the next slide one of the provinces melita province said it didn't want any ccp investment in the province and one of the reasons it stated was because they they acknowledge the freedom of religion as a fundamental right and further observes the entrenched christian faith and belief in god by their people therefore reject the chinese communist party and its formal systems based on atheist ideology this is very important it's it's important to understand that um for some people in the region it's their self-identity in terms of uh people of example next slide please uh the leader of melita province uh daniel sue danny needed health care and the there was a kind of an exploitation of china's social credit system where the central government refused to fund his health care uh unless he accepted china and he wouldn't he was literally willing to die rather than take chinese money in the end the taiwanese stepped in and ensured that he got the medical treatment he needed in taiwan um this is a kind of shows how at a very personal level china is trying to affect um political governance in the in the region next slide please they also bought about 39 out of the 50 members of parliament and local politicians are saying this is going to lead to violence this is destabilizing our country it's creating uh it's fi it's building on existing fault lines and creating a situation where we're going to have violence next slide and they had violence in november there were riots in the solomons and they burnt down a huge uh section of downtown next slide please which justified the australians sending in uh troops now uh many domestically were that australian intervention was keeping this unpopular pro-prc government in power and had the australians not intervened there probably would have been a no-confidence vote that would come out it's unclear why the australians went in but it's it's worth underlining there is no u.s embassy currently in the solomon islands and australian and new zealand interests are not necessarily u.s interests this shows the danger of outsourcing foreign policy following on that uh because the australians had set the precedent of sending in security troops uh the chinese could send in their own security troops and we ended up with this which is the chinese solomon island security agreement which is to maintain social order protect chinese citizens and major projects and it was followed by proposed china pacific islands country for the whole region development vision and a five-year plan next slide i won't go into it but it includes elements that are as detailed as fingerprint testing and cooperation uh positioning of uh supplies for hadr all that sort of stuff next slide please chinese foreign polit foreign minister wang yi of the countries that he visited what you end up seeing is the putting together of essentially their own first island chain off the coast of australia to potentially interdict the countries it's it's extremely problematic next slide please and the people of the region as mentioned know what they're seeing and there was a letter put out by the president of the federal states of micronesia david panwello where he said that that visit and what was proposed by the chinese was the most single most game-changing proposed agreement in the pacific in any of our lifetimes and he made it explicit to be clear china's long-term goal is to take taiwan peacefully if possible through war if necessary and that they knew that he thinks that this is all about getting the pacific island countries online in order to uh be in a position for china to take taiwan if necessary i'm going to stop there um and uh and go to q a but just so just the point of all of this is there the zone is highly active has been highly active for a long time the people of the country countries know it and as ambassador mcgann said just putting in place an anti-china policy is not going to work we definitely need something more and more comprehensive thank you uh so much cleo that was a really uh great uh overview sorry i'm gonna start put your video back on there um all right um there's so so much uh to chew on and think about after both of your remarks i want to start i think with something that you both talked about um which is the agreement um that china proposed the multilateral of ten nation agreement and i would i would kind of contextualize it a little bit more that uh china's proposal of this agreement um to the region followed a month before uh xi jinping's proposal at the boa forum for a global security initiative and of course the region of the agreement that china proposed wasn't entirely a security agreement right had trade and green development and other components as well but what i want to ask you uh maybe starting with you ambassador mcgann is how receptive do you think countries are in the region uh to this type of multilateral agreement involving china and the countries in the region well thank you john for that let me begin by stating that pacific countries have at their core their concerns that their human security interests are met now what does this mean in the case of china one of the things that we do know about chinese engagement in the region is that they will never cease to seize every opportunity they can to take advantage and sometimes those opportunities are handed to them inadvertently sometimes uh they're handed to them through benign neglect i found it interesting and consistent that cleo's presentation uh started off with the solomon islands and what's really important about the situation in the solomon islands is understanding that current prime minister sabhavari at one time was a politician receiving direct funding from taipei as a matter of fact i mentioned earlier that when i traveled to taipei to talk about their uh assistance practices in the region back into 2007 one of the issues that i raised was the fact that sobavari had been demonstrating great antipathy toward ramsey regional assistance mission program uh led by australia uh salvavari is uh by definition more of an ethic nationalist uh that he is pro one side or the other and so here we had uh solavari who was undermining and his political party ramsey are trying to push ramsay out of the solid islands and using taiwan as a mechanism to try and do that the interesting factor to this is that taiwan switched its approach stopped the rep funding of politicians and began taking a much broader approach toward economic assistance and actually changed how it was giving assistance to malita aima all right and the support that taiwan has on malita island is based primarily on that it has embarked upon a much widespread assistance program so what does this mean it means that uh china was able to exploit sobavari's antipathy toward uh australia and be very clear his antipathy toward australia all right and to replace the still standing ramsey security agreement with a chinese security agreement and was able to facilitate this through ongoing chinese funds and this kind of gets to back to your point about how pacific island countries deal with china's framework pacific island countries are responding to the great agility flexibility speed in which china can bring resources to bear on areas that pacific island countries are interested in and you juxtapose that against uh the united states which because of various reasons from congressional appropriations what have you to how its civilian agencies are funded to how the pacific deterrence initiative uh calling for greater uh u.s deployments in the region how all of that is brought to bear and how slow that works now we talk about the importance of having new u.s embassies in the region but if you look at the current legislation it takes three years at minimum to open up what is called an embassy all right and mind you that does not necessarily uh evoke visions of uh a large building uh with a 200 yard setback uh and 40 personnel it could be something quite small so let's be very clear uh and the issue is that the perceptions of engagement have to be followed or actually preceded by programs of engagement in order to counter the agility and the speed in which chinese have been able to address pacific island country needs also uh china has the advantage of working through long-standing indigenous populations of chinese in the region to also pursue their economic uh interest which is something the united states doesn't do i also want to just before in close remarks take a look back at the freely associated states and while the situation in martial islands is very important but if we look at what happened in the federated states of micronesia and although right now president pogelo is taking i think a much more favorable approach to dealing with china than his predecessors but you have to remember that when fsm first recognized beijing it was preceded by development assistance that was geared toward infrastructure primarily on the main island of chook in micronesia i and we do know at that time that because of various uh conditions situations on shoot that uh the fsm and particularly the island ii was not getting as quickly as it should the assistance from the u.s department of interior that was mandated under the compact or pre-association all right so keep that in mind secondly when we talk about uh again the contact for free association uh if we look at the irritants that uh the uh other freely associated states uh have had toward this implementation but one of the uh main problems has been when members or citizens that are associated states travel to the united states under under the cofa to work in the united states they were not afforded benefits that the average american worker could get because they were not american citizens even though they paid into medicaid they couldn't get medicaid even though um that members of freely associated states who resulted in being wounded warriors injured in afghanistan and iraq weren't able to fully get their veterans benefits because even though they had the right to serve they weren't americans and while you know not criticize the va uh at all but when the va says to a micronesian family no we can't provide you financial assistance for taking care of your wounded warriors son or daughter but we can send them to a veterans administration hospital in binghamton new york what do you think of that so the point i that i'm currently constantly trying to focus upon is that whenever there is a way in which the united states in particular but other partners have not stepped up to its obligations and responsibilities in the region china has taken that use it to their advantage exploited it and so we can be sure that wherever a gap in the region exists because the united states and its allies don't fill it the chinese will and that kind of gets us to the situation where we are today and back to your point what other perceptions of pacific island countries uh their episodes are really based on one thing who is going to address our issues first and who is going to just talk to us about additional assistance and who's providing it and whether or not the gaps that we we create in the region are self-imposed if they are self-imposed they are creating conditions for beijing's exploitation now stop there thank you i think that that kind of raises an interesting point and there seems to be somewhat of a debate on this right whether um the u.s is sort of squandering an advantage in the region right by not coming through on its uh province promises and commitments uh and what could be what can kind of be done done about that um cleo is that your your sense as well that um the us has kind of been out in front uh but now china is making inroads um or or would you would you look at it a little differently yeah i mean the us has uh withdrawn it withdrew after the end of the cold war to a large degree and assigned strategic oversight to a lot of the region to australia and new zealand there were two problems with that one is their interest may not be us interests the other is this is not one region you know if you it's it's multiple regions and focusing just on the region that's north of the equator the sort of micronesian region it's confusing because there's also a country called micronesia but the micronesian region uh which includes the five countries including the three u.s freely associated states as well as guam which is u.s territory with u.s citizens and the commonwealth of northern marianas there is there's no traditional role if i went through the history of kwajalein on purpose there's no traditional role there for australia or new zealand so for um the u.s policy to be to operate via the pif and through australia and new zealand marshall islands isn't a member of the pif anymore and australia and new zealand have no don't have anywhere near the sort of relationship the us has with the people of the region and the people of the region have with the us um and and it's incredibly important to open up these new embassies but currently i think three of the five existing embassies don't have ambassadors so it would be nice to just sort of work to take advantage of of what is already there and remember that those these freely associate states in particular are all only ever one election away from walking away from those agreements they have blank checks on their desk i can guarantee you i i know this from china how much do you want 750 million a billion how much do you want to walk away from the kofis and they have and they have urgent problems now the palau currently just within the last week had that um wan wang 5 spy ship chinese spy ship in their waters research vessel which is in sri lanka or on their way to sri lanka causing such problems for the indians and they don't want him there they want they they they don't know how to get rid of them they don't have uh us support for for getting rid of them they know that they're going up and down their undersea cables and and tracking their all of their that sort of critical infrastructure um and you know if the us isn't there to meet the existing responsibilities not just to the people of the region but to the u.s security uh in infrastructure that's why they want uh the defense and security arrangements with the freely associated states that it's understandable that that they would be looking another way i'd also um just quickly on this very important topic that ambassador mcgann brought up about ramsey and how basically it created this turn-key situation for china to come in and take over um what would be extremely helpful what would underpin any of these conversations is to have a discussion about what is your vision as australia or new zealand or the united states or japan or the quad for this region within the next 10 to 20 years what do you think this kind this region should look like and uh australia and new zealand have been quite explicit to say what they're working towards through things like the pacer plush trade deal and some of these other agreements is integration they basically want to integrate the pacific island countries and again remember that they're primarily probably only have leverage to do it in the southern pacific region the melanesian polynesian zone and probably not melanesia which is why you end up with people like sogovari so uh push anti australia integrate them into their economic and defense systems if you're going to integrate an independent country you need to weaken it you need to weaken their governance and economies in order to make them subject to to you in order to be able to integrate them if you weaken those countries which we saw kind of happen during ramsay another country can come along that is stronger and has more money and more focus and take over those weak pieces of infrastructure so i would argue that actually the goal shouldn't be integration the goal should be to help these countries be as strong and independent as possible and they will naturally align with the free world in in that context and that's the sort of things that ambassador mcgann is talking about in terms of listening to what they need on the human security front and uh and ensure that their security perimeter is defended against illegal fisheries but also against these research vessels and all that other stuff that's happening in their waters that they don't have the capacity to defend against but integration you know turning them back into colonies remember both australia and new zealand were colonial powers in the region and there are still countries in us in the pacific that new zealand calls part of the realm of new zealand the head of the pacific island farm who's from the cook islands holds a new zealand passport right this is this is this isn't going to work especially not in the micro newsroom countries so we need to re-look at the structure of the region and also what what is actually the goal what are we building towards and what are we helping countries the region build towards that will help them resist today it's china you know before it was japan we don't know what it's going to be next we need to uh you know if we can get through the next phase we need to figure out an architecture that's going to make this zone uh not a consistent front line as it has been for the last 120 years and we don't want any more guadalcanals and john can i uh jump in real fast before we close yeah one of the things that we also uh mentioned briefly was the status of kerabox and kiribati is another example of what happens when the united states underutilizes its existing tools and again looks the other way in 1979 the united states signed a treaty of friendship with kiribati which actually called for many of the things minus the migration elements of the kofas that called for closer cooperation with the the united states and karabaws the treaty of friendship was never uh allowed to lapse all right because even though it had an initial 10-year life none of the neither one of the two parties to the treaty exercised that so the treaty of friendship actually has been restarted by the two marine protective conservation area agreements between kiribati and the united states which were enacted under the bush and the obama administrations that called for greater coordination between the two countries we have not yet at all maximized our ability to engage with kiribati under those existing agreements instead what we find is an aggressive approach by china to change the multilateral fishing agreements and arrangements in the region by trying to persuade caravas to engage in a bilateral fishing agreement that essentially supersedes those around the 60 million dollars a year that the united states has uh pledged uh under the tuna treaty to that is actually taken into place uh by the foreign fisheries agency all right going around that and actually china's going around the naru agreement of fisheries which is one of the strongest agreements on fisheries protection in the region and again the narrow agreement was something that was implemented instituted by a pacific island country and not by its farmers so the general point again is that the united states can do more by doing them by using his existing tools we're a charter member of the pacific community actually i think chronology which may have been formed before the united nations was formed we've had four americans who are director general of the pacific community uh which also oversees many of the prop agencies and yet we continue to underfund it but focus on a organization that we're not even a member of so i think that the point of this this morning's discussion is to understand clearly not only where we can do more where we can step up our game but also to understand clearly pacific island country's perceptions of what that means and expectations of real partnership with the united states and its allies and a clear determination by the pacific island countries to assert their sovereignty to meet their human security concerns by whoever is the highest bidder which leads us to where we are today great that is um i'm hearing a number of things there on kind of what the the pacific island countries are looking for uh from the us a positive vision engagement a role in capacity building and just really being more active and more more present in the region and coming through on these commitments and mechanisms and finally it's not all about the pip or the pacific islands forum uh as i think is a i guess um looking ahead and i gotta i know we didn't get in too much to audience q a and i apologize to that but i got a chat from an audience member um asking about uh the us expanding diplomatic presence in the region so i believe there were some new embassies announced ambassador mcgann you touched on this uh where will be where will these embassies be and will they make a difference uh in making progress on in this engagement with the region my understanding the new embassies will be in tonga carabas and salmon islands remind you the engagement with those three countries have been operated uh out of suva for tonga and kiribati most people are aware of the fact that 10 years ago we actually opened up a consular annex that was act that was built and paid for by the tongans uh to allow visa and emergencies and services uh to uh be given uh and to support the quarterly visit of an american council officer uh as well as whatever business the american ambassador wants to engage in and the town is themselves built at bureau of diplomatic securities specifications so there are ways in which we can accelerate our engagement without necessarily focusing on building new buildings uh what we need are consistent programs uh we regularly visit uh our super kiribati uh have officers who go there but again it's the absence of programs not the absence of a presence that stymies our engagement and the same applies to solomon islands which is currently managed out of our embassy in port moresby we did have a consular agent in a long-standing one working in onaraya but again uh i do think that uh cleo's point is quite correct and that most of our engagement in solomon islands was handled by uh our partner countries in the region and that the periodic visits uh from port moresby were insufficient mind you report more as we also covered vanuatu uh vanuatu has also been the was the last site of a major uh u.s infrastructure project by the william challenge corporation uh in the pacific we now by the way uh see uh mcc uh engaging more a team or less for instance building a major water and waste management uh project there but the whole point is that the as cleo mentioned has been the absence of engagement not the absence of a presence that has caused these gaps it's not building a building or renting office space it's what are the programs that are in place that assure pacific island countries and their governments that were there for the long haul and for them so that's i'm not suggesting i'm skeptical of having more embassies what i do think is that we have to focus more on having funded programs that address critical areas and whether or not our personnel go there on a tdwi basis whether or not the office space is provided by host countries the most relevant factor is that when we go we talk to the local governments we have something to offer and we expeditiously meet their concerns to prevent china from exploiting the lag time between our intent our promise and our implementation and i that struck me about the difference between presence and uh engagement in programs and of course we know that china has no shortage of programs right that's their that's kind of their whole mo so um i guess uh cleo if we can any last words uh from you to kind of wrap us up here um maybe what to think about uh for the region uh moving forward in the next five years um what can the region expect moving forward so we know it we know the chinese trajectory and uh as ambassador miyan said they're very good at identifying gaps and in fact uh building on them and creating more trouble so we we have at least three locations where there's uh the potential for very violent situations which would be bougainville malayta and chuuk and unless they're kind of understood those dynamics they can be very easily avoided the people of the region have pathways out of them there's uh the council peace agreement for the solomon situation uh bougainville is heading on a certain trajectory it should be encouraged uh in in a way that that keeps them in the in the in the family and uh the uh situation really does need to to be addressed and figured out whether but there are active political warfare operations going on consistently from the chinese to try to create problems and and the people who who feel it first are the people of the region but the goal is to push the us back to hawaii and to create this this zone uh where the where they've got this chinese greater co-prosperity sphere sort of thing don't underestimate that they have at least half a dozen think tanks in china just looking at the pacific islands their ambassador to tonga now currently used to be a junior person in the uh tongan embassy there he's learned the language he has the relationships he they've got they know everybody they're dealing with they have deep intel files on everybody in the pacific islands the pacific islanders know it but they have very few tools to push back and um you know the this is not going to go away so the question is do does the us engage now send good people who know their systems and who like ambassador mcgee ambassador mcgann is responsible for that tongan console office which was very important for building the relationship between the u.s and tonga do that those sorts of just smart things to show that the u.s cares now and the us you know the the americans are very important how many americans died you know 80 years ago to to liberate they haven't forgotten that the people of the region haven't forgotten the relationship between the us and the region is is in blood you know they fought alongside the americans they know the stories from their grandparents it it shouldn't be undervalued um we have uh carolyn kennedy ambassador kennedy heading to the solomons now with wendy sherman both of their fathers fought in in those battles um so don't don't outsource it you know this is this is a deep close bilateral relationship that is uh born in the concept of fighting for freedom and if that's brought back into the fight in the political warfare field the u.s can make very huge advances very quickly and it's what the region is waiting for and really wants i guess ambassador mcgann i'll give you the last word um do do looking out over the next five years um you know does the region i guess they wouldn't say prosperity sphere but does the region become part of china's community of common destiny um or is there a kind of an alternative future that you see i think we cannot understate the predilection within the region the propensity for pacific islands countries to want to be aligned with the united states they want to see the united states at the table they want to see the united states in a leadership role they want to see the united states exercising its own capabilities to meet their priorities if that happens in the next five years we can assuredly push back on chinese expansion in the region right well that's a fairly optimistic note uh to leave us on so i want to thank everyone for joining us today i'll certainly be revisiting uh this this conversation and it will be available on our website jamestown.org and also on our youtube page i really want to thank our our two excellent panel panelists today uh for giving us their time and their insights and all of you for joining us thanks so much
Jht_2aQW6eM,The Crisis in Karabakh and Iran's Rise in the South Caucasus,"On the morning of Friday, January 27, an armed gunman broke into the Azerbaijani embassy in Tehran, killing the head of security and wounding two guards. The suspect was arrested by the Iranian police after the attack. Azerbaijan suspended diplomatic activity at the embassy and pulled its staff out of Iran, leaving behind a small cadre of security guards to protect the building. Tehran's police chief characterized the attack as the work of a lone gunman, driven by personal problems. Azerbaijani officials, including President Ilham Aliyev, rejected this version of events, however, declaring that Iran was responsible for providing security to the embassy and demanding an immediate, full and transparent investigation of the events, which Aliyev described as a “terrorist attack.”

On January 28, a drone strike was launched on targets within Iran, further raising tensions. The strike was assumed to be the work of Israel, with which Azerbaijan maintains closer ties than any other Muslim country. The relationship between Iran and Azerbaijan has worsened since the outbreak of the Second Karabakh War in 2020, with intermittent clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan intensifying throughout 2021 and 2022. Past conflicts and the current diplomatic crisis have resulted in deepening ties between Azerbaijan and Israel, with Baku having sent an ambassador to Tel Aviv for the very first time just weeks before the attack. Azerbaijan also appears to be drawing closer to the West more broadly. On the other side, Armenia has the support of Iran—which continues to suffer major anti-regime protests—and an increasingly weak Russia.

The Jamestown Foundation is proud to present the forthcoming webinar on “The Crisis in Karabakh and Iran's Rise in the South Caucasus” on Thursday, February 16 at 11:00 AM EST. Jamestown is pleased to host several leading experts to examine the current crisis, the rising instability in the South Caucasus and the outlook for the region in 2023 and beyond.

afternoon early evening we're delighted to have you participate in our event today entitled crisis in karabach and Iran's rise in the South caucuses uh we have three very interesting speakers who will be speaking today and for as many of you may know uh in terms of recent developments in January 27th an armed gunman broke into these azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran killing the head of security and wounding two guards the suspect was arrested by the Iran and police after the attack and then Azerbaijan shortly thereafter suspended diplomatic activity at the embassy and pulled the staff out of Iran leaving a small Cadre of security guards tehran's police chief characterized attack is the work of a lone gunman driven by personal problems Azerbaijan officials including president ilhamalia rejected his version of events declaring that Iran was responsible providing security to the Embassy and demanded immediate full and transparent investigation into the events which he described as a terrorist attack so many of you are following the events going on in the caucuses but what we haven't really addressed recently are the development of Iran's rise in the South caucuses Iran becoming a closer military ally of Russia uh recently agreeing um to provide Russia with the moja here six drone which is an attack drone similar to The Predator and many of you have been following the Drone attacks on Ukraine provided uh with the weaponry and drones given by Iran to Russia so we're going to address also the crisis in Karbach and the standoff in La chin uh so we'll start this discussion with a historical perspective of recent developments in azerbaijani Iranian relations with Fareed shafiya he's chairman of the Baku based Center of analysis of international relations he attended Harvard University School of government he's had also a PhD from Carleton University in Ottawa and written many different Publications on the region uh the second speaker will be Brenda Schaefer is the International Energy and foreign policy specialist focusing on politics and energy in the Caspian region energies security policy as well as European security she's now a faculty member at the U.S Naval Postgraduate School and also a senior advisor for energy at the foundation for defense democracy Think Tank and a senior fellow at the Landing council's Global Energy Center in Washington D.C our next and last speaker will be the one and only Paul Goble who needs no introduction one of the remaining prominent nationalities experts on the former Soviet Union uh in the United States and a longtime expert on commentator on uh the region and the caucuses he's also authors a daily output through Windows of Eurasia and also contributes to the Eurasia daily monitor twice a week so Fareed the floor is yours give us a kind of assessment what's been happening with azerbaijani uh Iranian relations and especially in the last two years begin I know you went off for kind of a survey of what's happened in the last 30 years so the floor is yours yeah well thank you very much uh I thanks then you personally and also the whole team at Jamestown for this I think very important discussion just would like to to say just a few words of kind of disclaimer I'm I'm speaking on my own behalf yes the think tank which I represent it's the government funded think tank but uh I am not speaking on behalf of the government I'm I would I will speak also about the government views uh the Brazilian government views on the current situation but uh again I I'm speaking in my personal capacity on on kind of in the context of academic a discussion in order to look generally what we have now between Iran and Azerbaijan and Iran in the South caucuses Iranian polls and the soft caucuses um we don't have time for long uh overview but very short overview of what's going on since the collapse of the Soviet Union Azerbaijan appeared as independent country Iran uh in some elements of Iranian nationalists with wave you Azerbaijan and generally the the whole South caucuses including Armenia as part of the Persian Empire's Legacy and especially they deny ethnic identity of azerbaijinis we believe that azerbai Genesis just um Iranian tribe which adopted Turkish language because of turkic language because of the waves of migration from the Central Asia so and they still some for example uh Iranian nationalists we refuse to call the Republic of Azerbaijan they called the Republic of Baku that's the historical context of the Iranians view on the south caucuses but on on this side on azerbaijin's side there's also historical view on on the especially on the northern part of Iran what we call South Azerbaijan as a part of historical Azerbaijan which was divided uh by Russian Empire and and the uh gajar Empire in in the beginning of 19th century the presence of big uh the the indigenous population azerbaijanis in Iran in in areas like Tabriz or the bill and some others and the figures different uh 25 million 30 Millions but that's the factor which concerns of course Iran this the second I think the fault lines let's say between uh the one-fold line is the historical uh with uh the disputes but the second fault line is the completely different nature of the statehood in Iran and Azerbaijan Iran is the Shia theocracy Azerbaijan is this the secular country and I think for Iranian clerics it represents a threat you know because there is not much sheer majority countries uh we have Iran Iraq uh Bahrain and Azerbaijan so um as Iraq the the immediate neighbors so they are concerned about this development that Azerbaijan assuming uh secular identity third fault line it's about Regional alliances um Iran from in the 90s was not happy that Azerbaijan invited Western oil companies British Petroleum and some of them you know Western companies to work in Azerbaijan Iran was not happy with the developing relationship between the United States and Azerbaijan I'm speaking especially in the context of the United States the first decade of Independence and um obviously Iran is not happy with the Azerbaijan uh relationship and growing relationship of Israel we just recently announced that we are opening the embassy and the Ambassador should the newly appointed Ambassador should live very soon for for Israel but uh on our side also the Azerbaijan views there alliance between Iran and Armenia especially if we look at the 30 years of Armenian occupation and we have the facts that the Iran helped Armenia different times in 90s and recently we've seen the Iranian tracks in our territories controlled by Armenians so of all that development put additional attention between their in the relationship between two countries whereas the fourth elements it's about Iranians intention to penetrate into azerbaijan's society inside through the Shia clerics we had incidents when the iranian-backed terrorists were apprehended in Azerbaijan several times in 2012 when Azerbaijan was uh I was about to host Evra Vision Song contest where it was um there were people arrested for the intention to attack Israeli Embassy and U.S embassy so that's uh well established facts also in 2015 where it was uh the clashes between the religious uh elements inside Azerbaijan in the village called nardaram um which is on the heavy influence of Iran so that's indeed the context of our relationship but um we in the meantime should speak about two countries as the neighbors so uh the trade very straight and there was the interaction between two countries a number of projects were signed energy swap in 2005 uh the Azerbaijan agreed with Iran that Iran will provide the gas to nakshiwan it's the Azerbaijan exclave uh recently Azerbaijan Iran and Turkmenistan signed trilateral deal about the gas swaps so we have indeed this relationship we have uh certain economic projects in the pipeline for example North and South Corridor it's not moving ahead because Iran is not willing to uh to construct its own portion of their railroad we speak about the sanctions economic difficulties but at certain time Azerbaijan was ready to provide even Financial um means to finish this project um so that's the the context uh that I would say economic and certainly somehow humanitarian context between um Azerbaijan and Iran Iran lifted visa requirements for for other Virginia citizens visiting Iran but Azerbaijan did not reciprocate um however an also important point that the formerly Iran supported azerbaijan's territorial Integrity even congratulated Azerbaijan when uh Azerbaijan managed to liberate its territory after 30 years of our main occupation but that's on the Diplomatic level uh I think what uh became a shocking surprise for Iran it's the azerbaijan's victory in the in the second karabakh war Iran was happy that Azerbaijan is weak on the occupation uh it didn't represent kind of from very perspective threat to Iran on the Northern borders but once the Azerbaijan won the war liberated territories uh and I mean Iran perceived Azerbaijan as a growing power in the South Caucasus and plus two other elements here it's the Azerbaijan Turkish Alliance especially the Azerbaijan signed with turkey declaration in in June 2021 basically it's military time on Military Alliance well we had that treaty since uh certain agreements with turkey uh into even back in 2010 but that social declaration and also azerbaijan's insistence on so-called zangisur Corridor Corridor which should be built between Azerbaijan and naft Juan through Armenian territory let's say Transportation link made Iran very nervous we have also to think about the general context of uh what's going on geopolitically around Iran Iran invested a lot of um you know financial means military means and destabilizing situation in in the Middle East in Yemen in Syria in Lebanon in Iraq uh but if we see uh Iran is losing ground in many places probably except the Yemen situation in Syria is not good because the the Russian factor is diminishing where uh in Iraq situation also uncertain Afghanistan in our Point uh of uh contention the Taliban um uh is not pro-iranian versus the the government which was before uh so uh we have to look also at the internal situation in Iran internal instability uh demonstration manifestations the failure of GC POA Iran was really um I I believe the Iran was expecting that they somehow will finalize it I will get out of sanctions that will the money will be coming so that the whole situation made Iran very aggressive and especially with speaking about the fraction inside Iran and not the fraction but basically the ruling Elite it's the sepa Revolutionary guards uh so I I I believe and because I had the contacts with the some Iranian diplomats even the prior or this attack on uh Azerbaijan Embassy um I I had the feeling that they wanted to kind of the improve relationship but when did this attack happened uh so uh we've seen in Iranian media a lot of anti-azurbation Articles video clips threatening Azerbaijan like um and those uh Clips those the articles in the media Outlets which controlled by revolutionary guards so definitely we are the the at the Forefront of the uh policy of the pressure against uh Azerbaijan we see this trend since the and also a very important factor that we see the strength of tension uh military exercises conducted by Iran at the border with Azerbaijan for 30 years of Armenian occupation Iran speaking about the Muslim Unity Islamic solidarity blah blah blah but never they did any exercise at the border which was under occupation but now since it's liberated we conducted several military exercises and some of those the nature of military exercises putting their font on Bridges definitely it's a kind of signal of the Readiness of Iranian Army to cross the River on the North and attack Azerbaijan yes and that's happening since the arrival of this government Racey government the righteous government came to power in in July and the the exercise first exercise was done in if I'm not mistaken 21st of September uh 2021 so and we we see that trajectory the rising tension and uh because of the the time limits uh I will just briefly speak about the latest incidents uh Glenn you already spoke about what happened attack on um Azerbaijan Embassy in Tehran and the Iranian version that it was attack of some you know unstable person for um the personal reasons but you see if we look uh at the history of Iran Iranian treatment of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relationship it's not something new uh the Iranian regime came to power in in the end of 70s with the incident of the American hostage taking the American diplomats and recently uh once the once Iran has problem with particular country when we see attack on the embassy 2016 attack on the Saudi Embassy 2011 attack on the bridge Chambers and we continue convert some incident against Pakistan against France in the 80s so um you attacked the embassies in Tehran you're referring to yes yes yes attacked two embassies basically they destroyed them with Saudi Embassy and the British Embassy heavily damaged in 2011 Chambers in 2016 Saudi so that happened when indeed Iran had the problems and I mean the tension went up so I don't think um this incident in something done by individual uh I uh whereas the context of azerbaijani propaganda campaign in Iran so for that reason uh I think the Azerbaijan made a right decision to withdraw and you also think that you also think that this is related to the uh Azerbaijan establishing diplomatic relations with Israel is that also kind of we have the relationship with Israel since 90s in the beginning of nights no it's about um the embassy opening um the walls of which I should mention that um Armenia is uh the Iran recently opened Consulate in in kafan in Armenian City in sunic region which is between nacho and Azerbaijan uh so uh once they did and I mean we were talking through Israel for many years about uh opening of our Embassy so I wouldn't just link to this particular element you know opening of Embassy in Israel but generally the situation between Iran and Azerbaijan and basically that's that's it I mean if some people said too that the attack occurred on the anniversary of the uh opening of the embassy is that or am I mistaken is that opening Embassy anniversary diplomac relations attack there was a something with an anniversary uh that on the date of the attack on is am I mistaken on that uh did they I'm not sure about the day that it was exactly uh 27th January was the date of the Diplomatic relationship of Israel uh we have to check it what was the exact date okay well listen that's a great overview of Azerbaijan Iranian relations and when the lace incident of course there's a crisis simmering in karabakh and there's a standoff on lechen and and there's no one better to talk about this than uh Brenda Schaefer so Brenda uh please weigh in here okay thank you so you know many analysts when they think about Iran they think that you know as the Islamic Republic that Islam is a big motivation for its alliances for its for its foreign policy priorities and you know for instance when they try to think about why does Iran so wholeheartedly support the Palestinian cause and that that it's something about Islam but nothing refutes that more than it's it's really it's policy towards its northern neighbors towards Armenia and towards Azerbaijan because here we have from you know from the minute of the Soviet collapse um Iran being very hostile to the Republic of Azerbaijan from you know from day one of its establishment and very friendly uh to Armenia and this is despite the fact that you know in the initial War between Armenia and Azerbaijan Armenia occupied close to 20 percent of azerbaijan's territory in turn a million Shia Muslims into refugees right so it's very hard to say well sympathy with Palestinian refugees motivates its its Israel Palestine policy yet lack of sympathy for Muslim Shia refugees that were created not a hundred years ago but but but but uh you know less than three decades ago or you know like during the time that they had become refugees and and even refugees that some of them escaped at a certain point Iran even had refugee camps in Iran Iranians were giving Aid to the refugee camps in Azerbaijan I mean they saw the plight of the refugees there was no you know no question so what what motivated why was Iran so hostile to Azerbaijan from the from the Inception of its independence and again even in December 19 1991 as the Soviet Union was collapsing when everyone thought that Iran would be excited about it independent Shia Authority country and five Muslim majority countries in Central Asia and ex think about exporting Islam what Iran was writing in Tehran times was this is a big tragedy it's a big danger to to Iran because the hand of nationalism is going to come over the border from the azerbaijanis from the turkmen so the real motivation in my opinion of its hostility they're the core motivation of Iran's hostility towards Azerbaijan is the fact that a third of the population of Iran is ethnic azerbaijanis um if you're interested more in the topic a recent book Iran is more than Persia which discuss all the ethnic minorities uh in Iran um and who's the publisher its degree to publisher in Berlin and uh it came out in this December uh uh sort of up to date on the question of ethnic minorities in Iran um so the azerbaijanis are the third of the population of Iran and there was a sense of a fear in Tehran that if Azerbaijan was strong prosperous um it could it could be a source of Attraction for its own azerbaijani minority it could raise ethno ethnic nationalism at the the time the government in the initial Independence period the government in in Azerbaijan government was very purported this idea of you know South Azerbaijan greater Azerbaijan so there was some there was something in the ground to sort of feed these fears as well so Iran from day one is the main supporter of our main Union it's war with Azerbaijan meaning that it could Armenia could not have sustained this war with all that without the transit of fuel supplies food and arms uh from Russia that went through Iran Iran was its main conduit why is it really important important to look at the dates of this you know again like from 92 93 94 to this whole period all of the Russian Aid to Armenia goes through goes through goes through Iran um because Georgia was in a civil war and and Russia doesn't have a direct border and so it couldn't use Georgian territory obviously couldn't use azerbaijani territory it's important to understand this because many explain Iran's hostility is connected to Iran's uh the azerbaijan's cooperation with the United States or it's its close relations with Israel but the timeline doesn't fit meaning that Iran was hostile from December 1991 throughout the war meaning it's something else and I think the best explanation for this is it's it's fear of hearing indentism or nationalism among its own azerbaijani minority um so so we have uh we so we have through the first war and again even Armenian this is not something debatable even Armenian government has thanked Iran many times and being its Lifeline given its food security um from the first war the second war the the 2020 Armenia Azerbaijan award is an escalation in Iran's war role in the war so same thing you know all the all any ships that that came with goods for Armenia they either arrived at anzali Port and in in Iran and and were taken across Iran to trucks into Armenia in fact the the the the contractor that had the contract for the trucks to bring from Russian ships in anzali to Armenia throughout Iranian territory was an ethnic azerbaijani that gave an interview in the media about it yes 680 trucks some month and this is the contract and he didn't even realize the geopolitical significant significance of this um um and all all Russian flights into Armenia went over Iranian territory you know the military flight so so one this same conduit role Iran had that it had during the 1990s but in addition this time we see actually direct intervention of Iran uh in the battlefield so we have at a very critical moment in the war Iranian forces crossing the border uh into zengilan and cutting azerbaijani forces that were on an offensive and in already part of them were in zengalan region true you know battles people people uh dying lives at stake here you have Iran coming in cutting the azerbaijani forces in half cutting supply lines I I believe that even azerbaijani soldiers probably six died because of this intervention and it also delayed the The Liberation of from The Armenian occupation it slowed down the whole momentum of the azerbaijani battle due to due to the cut and again there's films that these they're in Iranian uniforms there's films of this you know not something debatable Iran also also gave information to Armenia on troop movements Iran sometimes disrupted azerbaijani military Communications um you know at the border area so this was not just being the conduit of fuel and arms and food but also actively participating probably also a big part of the Armenian success in the July uh July 2020 attacks on the eve of the war in tavoos and and some and some of their success um around Hindi was was due to how can be was due to tunnels that Armenia had built probably this technology they received from Iran's it's the same kind of tunnels that the irgc has taught you know that Hezbollah and the Hamas to use very sophisticated tunnels that are very difficult to to detect them um and you know really sort of military standards um and more and more of these tunnels have been uncovered as as Azerbaijan um you know starts construction and surveying of the of the liberated territory so so here we see Iran you know directly involved the war was also though it was a turning point um for the ethnic azerbaijanis in Iran if actually maybe for most of the post-soviet period tehran's fears were unfounded you know most of the ethnic azerbaijanis were not not trying to rise up against the Iranian state things that started to change over the 1990s over you know over over the years especially with you know Turkish television and azerbaijani television beaming into most of the homes of the azerbaijanis in Iran and them not watching Persian language television um Turkish and azerbaijani cultural figures music figures if you even look at for instance the social media of so many of these young women who've been shot murdered in Iran in the recent demonstrations that about half of them were ethnicer by Johnny's they were all following you know Turkish singers their their social media was in the Turkish language and so you see this real sort of the social media really enabled uh uh a real um a real resurrection of ethnic identity in Iran um but the war was at this particular turning point because when the ethnic azerbaijani saw trucks with Russian arms going through their their provinces and going into Armenia when people ethnic azerbaijanis went to the Border despite Iranian government attempts to to disrupt it went to the Border saw you know saw the battles live and you know cheered on the azerbaijani soldiers this was a turning point and you know and I think um actually Iran sort of by helping Armenia actually set the stage to have more of an ethnic problem then uh that it would have had if if it wouldn't have helped the war also left Iran as sort of the major strategic loser so if if the War uh brought to you know Azerbaijan liberated its territories um it it demonstrated that it had a very sophisticated well-trained uh military um this brought turkey you know further into the region um in a certain extent it also strengthened Russia's position in in the region because they're Russian so-called peacekeepers now um now deployed in Azerbaijan there will probably be Russians on the you know zengazer corridor open so it'll probably be a Russian uh potential Russian uh presence there uh so the big loser is actually Iran because now Russia and Turkey you know have additional um presence on on its near its northern uh border so we're seeing now with with from last summer um there was there was a sort of a an intensification acceleration of of a western-led peace process between Armenia and Azerbaijan mostly together between the U.S and the EU is making significant progress towards a peace treaty and of course if there was a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan who would be against this will be Russia and Iran because they need to keep that conflict alive in order to have a lever so we see both Russia and Iran from last summer trying to disrupt uh the peace process and it even gets to uh Iran deploying irgc irgc contingent in in Han candy in Among The Armenian population uh living in karabakh under the under the support of the Russian peacekeepers probably their training giving um giving training to the ethnic Armenians in karabakh in order to keep the conflict alive um and um it was very interesting with these irgc members they have their their uh their identity cards and they all come from this house how surprising they all come from the same city in Iran they're all the same age uh you know the live live in the same uh same region where there happens to be a major irgc uh base so um again there's an escalation here um with with Iran's activities towards a conflict towards um Azerbaijan um and I would just say that in addition to the question about the embassy attack which is a further escalation two weeks before the attack uh the commander of the irgc seppa warned Azerbaijan that you know it's going to pay for its uh foreign policy choices for its for its actions towards Theron I mean they're very explicit warning you know what it wasn't like oh this just happened in no con you know context there was a warning that this was going to happen and you know Iran made good on its on its promise so maybe I'll I'll leave it at that okay and we do want you to go into what some of your uh on what's happening in karabakh with the lachen standoff also uh but maybe I'll turn the floor we'll come back to that in a question answer session I'll go ahead and move to Paul for right now and um and and circle back with you on that okay thank you Glenn and thank you for organizing this session and inviting me I've as everyone else I'm sure I've learned enormous amounts from both of the previous speakers but what I'm going to try to do is not to point to so many specifics as to talk about the elephant in the room and that is of course the emerging Alliance or axis between Moscow and Tehran uh because I think that much of what we have talked about today has to be looked at with an entirely new eye than it did before that Alliance emerged there is a there has been a convergence of interest between Russia and Iran on certain issues as well as many differences of course but the emergence uh since the start of the uh Russian war in Ukraine has been so great that I think we have to revisit much of what we understand uh and having done so then we need to revisit what we actually do for most of the last 30 years I can certainly testify Western analysts have assumed that the three most important actors outside the caucuses were Russia turkey and Iran and they've also assumed that since the three had such Divergent interests they would act as counterweights to each other because of turkey Iran would be limited because of both turkey and Iran Russia would be limited um and so on and so forth and that all of the discussions that have had focused on one or another have taught in terms of that limitation and from that people drew the conclusion that the European Union in the United States western power is born generally couldn't who could exercise more influence in the region than would have been possible if there were not three computer competing sources elsewhere and that they could do so at relatively with a relatively small commitment of resources there was an assumption that given this balance uh if the West did something at the EU or the Americans did something they could achieve more than would otherwise be the case I mean if there's a balance you can move things with a small amount of effort if there isn't you need a much bigger one now I would argue the situation has changed because two of the three most out important outside actors in the south in the Caucasus Russia and Iran have formed an axis first military but more more importantly strategically and that changes everything else because it means that the possibilities for the three countries in the region have changed and the possibilities of outside actors like turkey and the United States the European Union and Israel have changed as well when you're up against when you can count on Russia and Iran balancing off each other in certain circumstances uh you don't have to do as much as you do if you're facing that uh that combination in the long term I certainly believe that the the Iranian Russian Alliance will collapse I think that the differences between the two powers are simply too great uh to make that possible and I think the successor regime to Putin's and the current regime and however it evolves in Iran will move in different directions each undermining the interests of the other country and making it far less possible to have an impact on the south Caucasus than they can have together now but in the near future in policy relevant time if you like in the next year or two at most the possibilities that are granted to those two Powers by this axis are so enormous that we need to revisit almost everything we say about the about the region because it doesn't mean the same thing today that it meant a year ago it simply is a different world that we're dealing with in many respects it seems to me what we are seeing now is recapitulation of what happened in the 1930s uh when Britain France and other Western democracies acted on the assumption that the the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union could never reach an agreement the two said they hated each other the two said they would never cooperate the Zeus had said very clearly that the other regime was the one they most wanted to destroy and then what happened Molotov rip and trapped and they came together and when they came together what the West was in was capable of doing changed dramatically what the nature of the threat the West had to counter changed dramatically it could no longer assume that the conflict between between Germany and the Soviet Union was so great so overwhelming that it would keep the Hitler's War Machine away from them it would mean that what was going on in the countries in between either the West could do nothing about or had to do something some kind of security guarantees which would ultimately open the way to a bigger War now this analogy I would be I would hasten to add isn't perfect uh Putin's Russia and the Ayatollah zaran are not equipped exact equivalents to Stalin's Soviet Union or Hitler's Nazi Germany neither of the current Powers is as strong as its predecessor both have domestic problems and aspirations that are different in kind than those which Berlin and Moscow had in 1939 but for the three countries in the caucuses and for the regions connected to it and I want to mention Central Asia because I think we've got to understand that what's going what's now going to happen in the caucuses is going to have an enormous spillover effect in Central Asia especially in Uzbekistan in Turkmenistan but more generally can you explain why Paul what do you say that's I can go into it it's simply we have acted as if the only north-south Corridor available to Moscow and Iran is through the Caucasus that's not true the uh the fact is the Russians are trying to develop as are the Iranians a shipping capacity on the Caspian and an expanded rail transport system along the eastern border of the Caspian Sea through turkey Uzbekistan Turkmenistan what that means is the uh assumption that Moscow and Iran's policies are limited by the need to have that north-south Corridor they don't have to have it they can go east either on the Caspian and if you look at the development of ports in the north at Australia and in in in Iran and the southern borders at Southern Shores of the Caspian Sea and if you look at the different costs of expanding rail traffic through Central Asia as opposed to what as as Fareed is quite clearly showed the Iranians can't possibly afford to build that last 140 kilometers of line it goes through the some of the most mountainous territory uh that one can imagine so what that's going to mean is this new axis between Moscow and ran is going to spill over very quickly into Central Asia because if Russia has to make sure that it has a Central Asian line it will behave differently Iran will behave differently there and the West which may want to contain both of them will have to behave as well my concern is less what's going to happen on the ground immediately I think many of the processes we've been seeing I have very little confidence there's going to be peacekeep peace treaty anytime soon I think we've we've seen too many times when uh we got close to peace and didn't get it uh at Key West no no other and I also think that the possibility that there aren't plenty of people around not just the Iranians the Russians but others to stick uh to poke sticks into the wheel and make that problematic at the same time I think we need to think very very seriously in the west about understanding what this Alliance does and it means that if if Moscow and Tehran begin to coordinate their policies it means that turkey has to make a much bigger investment and the Western countries more generally have to make a much bigger investment if they're going to have anything like the kind of influence they've had hitherto that isn't to say they can't it is only to say that that requires an attention to the area that hasn't been given in recent times and a willingness to commit resources of a variety of Kinds including security resources if that doesn't happen then what you're going to have is a Russian military base since dupontica forever not just an Iranian uh Consulate General in Scenic and that's I can't see that that's in our interest I certainly agree that the the Iran neither the Iranians nor the uh Russians are uh operating on the basis of religious principles alone although I would would suggest that you we need to remember that in a funny way the Shiite Shiite Iranian Iran's concern about the Remain the other Shiite countries parallels all too closely with Mr Putin's Russian World concerns about the only three other countries which have a Russian Orthodox majority Ukraine Belarus and Moldova uh it's an interesting it's it's just interesting parallel that your comments earlier uh make me provoking me in the short term what do I think the Russian uh Iranian Alliance is going to do more than we've already seen first I think you're going to see much less progress on any of the issues that we've talked about much less project progress on much in precisely because both Russia or excuse me each side of this axis can use the other to block things it doesn't like and claim as the Iranian foreign Ministry always does that it isn't us it's someone else and the West will accept that I regret to say the West will accept that we're very good at accepting anything that provides us with an excuse not to do anything and I I I'm saying what I'm saying is that this is this is this is as important in the South caucuses as Molotov rip and drop was in Eastern Europe and it doesn't just as Molotov rip and drop didn't stop with Eastern Europe the Russian Iranian axis isn't going to stop at the South Caucasus if it isn't addressed now if it isn't addressed with much greater Vigor than I see Western countries being willing to do then what we will see is on the one hand this Alliance will probably collapse but until it does it will have it will cause no end of trouble not just in the immediate regions not just in Central Asia but as far away as India where we've seen the uh the Indians carry water for Iran against Azerbaijan in recent days and I and I would expect that kind of policy to in the non-aligned movement I would expect that kind of behavior to spread moreover I think we have to understand that Russia and Iran are likely to be coordinating their policies not only on Azerbaijan but also on Armenia and also on Georgia and possibly even on the North caucuses and that has consequences for all those places Which Way Beyond the time I have but let's just let's be clear it will be even more difficult unless there's a willingness to spend the resources to integrate Georgia into the Western Alliance something which I think all of us would like to see to talk about the expansion of the EU more broadly than that uh and possibly eventually end uh end the Karbach dispute without which was the always the possibility and azerbaijani thrust into Stephanie care which would lead to a massive Armenian out migration uh president uh delamalev I think was very wise to stop the 44 day when he did so that you didn't get that humanitarian disaster and so the International Community came down far more on azerbaijan's side than would have otherwise been the case but we could get to a situation where there will be enormous pressure to do that again and then we have a war and we have a humanitarian crisis and that has consequences that I I promise you both Iran and Moscow would be only too willing to exploit now what I would like to just point to or three three things that I think the West needs to do in the face of this Alliance besides just understanding that it's there and there's been no there's been pitifully little commentary about the emergence of the Russian Iranian Alliance it's been it's been reduced largely to the question of drones either drones being supplied by the Iranians or Iranians providing personnel and Technology to build drones inside the Russian Federation but the fact that those things are happening suggests to me very strongly that we're talking about a much broader range of of policies that will be agreed to and once that's understood then I think we need then I think we need to take three steps in the west and I'll let me list those and then make one final column comment first of all it seems to me that the west and the region would both benefit by these rapid inclusion as possible of as many of the countries in the South caucuses as possible we cannot assume anymore that just because country a was in the pocket of one side or another earlier that it will remain there we've seen movement on all three countries and I think we see it in Armenia as well as Azerbaijan and Georgia I think we have to be open to that but we have to recognize that the inclusion of these institutions of these countries into the international Western International order is absolutely essential to break this Alliance so that the axis of the aggrieved and Outsiders and the Outlaws of the world doesn't expand second toward that end it seems to me the West needs to move as fast as it can to promote that the existing disputes that are there be resolved in ways that do not make it easier for this Alliance to work but make it more difficult I would certainly like to see Western support and encouragement for a genuine peacekeeping force in uh not the sir the uh simulacrum of a peacekeeping force which is the Russian occupation the Russians have no business being there or described as peacekeepers they do not qualify under an international law and we should be very clear about it countries that are parties to the dispute and the Russians have a military base in Armenia so they are a party to the dispute have no business calling themselves peacekeepers are being accepted as such by the International Community and third while we do these things in the caucuses it seems to be The Westerns do what it can to break apart this alliance between Iran and the Russian Federation I think we have to make it clear to both of them that this is not in their interests and that there are things that they will both lose in the longer term if they maintain it and that each will lose in terms because of the the near certainty that this Alliance will break down and then they will find themselves more at risk just as the as the Soviets were when the when Hitler decided to violate multip and go east now all of this that's happened all of this that's happened in terms of the emergence of this axis has to be laid it seems to me not so much at the door of Iran as at the door of the Russian Federation and under the criminal state established by Vladimir Putin his failing war in Ukraine and his search for allies among the outcasts of the world it is that possible it is that Russian search which is given Iran an opening and Iran has exploited it as Brenda has quite quite uh intelligently pointed out Iran's behavior is that of a state and not just of a religion despite what western commentaries often suggest but precisely because it is it is responding to the environment this was not a crisis created in Iran this was a crisis created in Moscow and we need to recognize it clearly this this axis is dangerous just as maultov rip and drop was dangerous it will be dangerous because it was created and it will be dangerous when it falls apart and those of us in the west who don't want to see either of those dangers fall either on the heads of the people of the region adjoining regions or in ourselves had better start paying attention to the the implications rather than assuming as almost all of us do that what we are dealing with in the caucuses as elsewhere is simply working out of those things we've seen over the past 30 years or the past 30 centuries in fact we are living in a new world and it is a world that is far more dangerous and far more likely to cause trouble for us and our friends than the world we we saw pass away before for the first Iranian drone went to Russia and the first Iranian drone was used by Russia against Ukraine thank you thank you Paul I'd like to go back uh Brenda and ask you a little bit about how this is going to play out in Karbach uh on lechen and this uh the recent developments with the the gentleman from The Armenian from Moscow who showed up in Karbach and is now playing a big role there uh Mr vardanian I believe is his name uh can you comment on that a little bit Brenda sure so just to also follow up in terms of the uh Russian Iranian Alliance you know Armenia hosts Three Russian bases one of them is an air base so the easiest way for Iran to supply weapons to Russia or vice versa without detection is for cargos to go on a land border between our Iran and Armenia there would even be the contents could even be undetected by Armenia itself straight to the air base Uh Russian Air Base uh in outside of Yerevan and flown directly into Russia to Ukraine wherever it wants to go it's a type of arms transfer also that would wouldn't be easily detected by intelligent Services because it's not like a plane from Tehran to to Moscow a military flight I mean would be a military flight but not understanding that the contents had come from Iran so I think that's very important to watch um you know on on the you know like that again why is the context of a potential peace process I I I it's not necessarily that sure that every time things get close it doesn't you know it's not over until it's over right but it is a motivation for Russia and Iran to try to undermine uh the West with this with this endeavor and we've seen on on the chin in contrast to this narrative that it's just a you know a nice humanitarian Corridor we've seen on Latin in the past especially in from 2021 um Armenian Minds Armenian soldiers you still have Armenian troops uh in karaba you know in in um um you know it's not just Armenian militants which is which also forbidden inside the territory of Azerbaijan right but not just Armenian militants but Armenian military proper that go on the team Corridor and and and enter into karabakh you have as I said irgc forces you've had new Armenian Minds manufactured in 2021 placed um placed in the in Carl back in the region surrounding karabakh that have have led to the deaths of azerbaijani soldiers and and civilians meaning another thing that that disrupts uh uh the the piece so so this idea that and I think also it's really important um the numbers there's not a hundred and twenty thousand Armenians in in karabakh um I was there in in 2003 and even local officials would wink wink when they were saying there were 60 000 living there and Satan was probably closer to 40 to 40 40 to 45 000 clearly after the war there's there's uh less less people uh living there and yes the the arrival of Ruben vardanian uh in karabakh again violation he's not a um you know he does he's not a local resident of karabakh um uh clearly would not happen without Russia's uh urging or there's no man no way that a man that all his money was made in Russia sits in Russian Banks is uh very close you know by open open his own interviews close to Putin close to the Kremlin um there's no way that uh this would happen even the fact that he could enter Via de la chin Corridor um under the Russian peacekeepers without you know Russia wanting this Russia wanting this to happen so it was made as a disruption uh to the peace process um the world you know Falls for it um and uh you know the local local representatives in karabakh you know immediately gave him the role as the as the as the as the leader of the karabakh Armenians again they went have done this without Russia's urging um you know so so we have Russia and Iran both trying to undermine the peace a piece that um you know as Paul pointed out if there was peace and eliminate delimitated borders that's good for Armenian and Azerbaijan that's not that's not some sort of concession of Armenia to to Azerbaijan the you know the best way to not allow Russia and Iran to um take advantage of the conflict is is to remove the conflict so peace is obviously in the interest of Armenian Azerbaijan and the west and Brenda if you let me intervene uh passion is also the Prime Minister of Armenia is also not very happy with vardanyan Khanna showing up out of the blue uh because that has repercussions for domestic politics inside of Armenia as well right well I think there's two ways to you know on one hand this strengthens that there's sort of this populist support to to organize for uh Another War and inside Armenia not you know not to go towards peace treaty so in this sense it's the opposition to Passion but on the other hand it gives them the it can fall back on the regular Armenian Playbook which they learned from Russia which is oh that's not us that's the that's the Armenians in karabakh go talk to go talk to you know nagona karobak that's not that's not us even though there's Armenian military forces in stepan candy you know today like they oh they the the same Russian Playbook the way Russia goes that oh that's not us that's independent you know Logan's donesque that's transnestria that's in independent forces Armenia has the same Playbook that karabakh somehow is a separate entity you know there's two Armenian States one with 2.5 million people one with uh you know by their own claims 120 000 people but though but that's a separate that's the second Armenian State you know so they use the same so I think to to have this and have the standoff occur there was some uh apparently inspections of vehicles that weren't being inspected and then suddenly weapons and and gold and other things started being sent out through the region uh through the through the Russian peacekeepers in my is it am I correct there I mean through the I mean through the region under the control the Russian peacekeepers there's a lot of uh illegal activity including Armenian forces going into karabakh natural resources being exploited like gold and and brought to Armenia and then sold it sold to Europe um mines you know this is not a peaceful Corridor the the humanitarian corridors and again we have to think about the whole the west and most of the world supports territorial Integrity of Ukraine and doesn't say no that territorial Integrity only applies to places where ethnic ukrainians live we we think no it's a principle of organization and International System that's very important and even if there's a Russian ethnic aggression by Jordan Crimea or donesque Ukraine is the right to restore its territorial Integrity so I would say that yes you have to find a way that their security and peace guaranteed for The Armenian population of karabakh but not in a territorial change because if we you know international law international institutions doesn't do much but if we throw away the principle of territorial Integrity we'll have complete Mayhem in the International System I think the same you know the same respect for territorial Integrity that Ukraine gets to benefit from so does Azerbaijan get to benefit from what because you know is it why would there be like sort of a two two systems um you know and again we don't want to start dividing up the World by many states by ethnic group right where supposedly we have States based on civic identity citizenship and not just on you know ethnic uh states of various ethnic enclaves and Farid I want to go to you and let you get a comment here briefly also on the situation and what is the the the discussions now about the involvement of the European Union sending monitors to uh Karbach what what is happening there on that front yeah well just uh one brief comment I think it's very easy to uh to end to this crisis on La chin simply uh it should be allowed to check what cargo is going in and out of the karabakh to Armenia so uh but I mean it doesn't want to do that because we have to look again at the context and the history lachin was the first region outside of nagorna autonomy which was occupied by Armenians in May 1992 and after that we see trajectory when the Armenians occupied some other territories outside of karabakh so so the chain was like a springboard to further Armenian Ambitions in the region yeah it's the military it's major military Supply Route was in 90s and right now too as far as the European Union uh is concerned um we generally I mean uh and Armenia also agreed on that we started working uh on on the peace treaty and the auspices of EU president Charles uh where it was five meters five meetings um one in 21 and 4 in 24 two uh had some positive uh let's say dynamic unfortunately the last meeting um it was the the Frank France which insisted to be present Azerbaijan agreed and then Armenia decided to turn or demand that the trilateral format Azerbaijan Armenian should be turned into four countries for four party formats France EU president Charles Michele Armin Azerbaijan and that's obviously you know Azerbaijan refused uh because France during the war and after the war uh the macron several statements was utterly anti azerbaijani so France is not mutual broker in this equation so what happened at the last meeting in Prague where France was also present but it was a proposal to deploy EU Civic mission on the border with uh between Armin Azerbaijan to control the situation to monitor Azerbaijan agreed to work with this Mission not to accept on its territory and our approach should be understood again in the context of this 30 years of occupation on number of occasions Azerbaijan approached the European Union uh including during the Thomas clashes you know which happened on the border outside of karabakh it was clear provocation has not related to the karabakh so but always the European Union approach was it's not us who are not the negotiators who are not Brokers go and you know resolve this issue with the OIC means group or bilaterally so you express no interest to be involved in this issue and now we see this big interest big push from EU to be there to control the situation and that indeed uh in Azerbaijan Azerbaijan cannot accept such attitude especially the knowing that players like France which will be under azerbaijani biased that's the one issue the second conceptual issue okay we don't have border border was under occupation for 30 years there are no posts there is no delimitation no demarcation how the EU mission is going to uh identify whether it's violation happened here or there so what Azerbaijan approach we need to sign the peace treaty based on the mutual respect of territorial Integrity both countries and then to launch the the process of the limitation and demarcation in this complex again Azerbaijan is not against EU involvement per se in this negotiation process and as I said Charles Michelle office was quite constructive and useful but with the setting and the modalities of the mission raises concern in Azerbaijan and Brenda what uh let me go back to Brenda with a question about where is U.S policy now we were going to appoint an Envoy to the South car or to the Karbach conflict uh and then that Envoy has departed I mean what what how did what are your perceptions of U.S policy towards this region it seems like they want to get more involved but they're kind of having trouble doing so um yeah no I mean I think the the peace process started in last summer I think the U.S government was acting very um very intelligently meaning that it was a very serious but very quiet process you know make don't uh you know make making progress and I think I think there is this an understanding of how important it is to remove the conflict have a peace treaty have the limitation like Perry says if you don't have the limitation how can you talk about uh you know you're always going to have conflict even in places where you know you have on the Canadian American Border in Maine there's a lighthouse where an American uh naval officer sleeps every night to make sure that Canada doesn't doesn't take this what you know one piece of territory that that's that's not not agreed upon in the Canadian American the limitation so of course you need to limited borders um I I'm not I'm not sure if everyone understood the significance of vardanian coming coming to carve up in how much it's a Russian Emissary and you know like like Paul said that it's whenever we have anything that we can hang on to that makes it allows us not to act so you know so so just to say somehow this is local and this isn't Russia disrupt you know disrupting the peace it's always convenient for us um I think U.S government doesn't monitor much the question of ethnic minorities in Iran and understand how that affects Iranian policy towards the region Iranian um stability you know that um as I pointed out in this book Iran is more than Persia you know 40 percent of Iranians don't consider themselves fluent in the Persian language you know so and and uh you know to understand how this is affecting these current demonstrations and and wave of anti-regime activity which which Iran in many ways blames Azerbaijan for it blames Outsiders azerbaijan's Iraqi Kurds um and you really need to understand this ethnic piece in order to understand what Iran is doing you know whether it's in Iraq or or in the in the South caucuses towards Pakistan Afghanistan and the ethnic issue is a big component of all of its foreign policy priorities thank you um if anybody Paul if you have a question or you want to just raise your finger I'm not trying to dominate the conversation here no no I I look I I've learned more from the two people who are real experts on the area than I can contribute I would simply add that we one of the things that lies behind my own fears about what's going on is that up until uh pashanyan took power Yerevan had been dominated by all its previous presidents have been dominated by people who came from were born in or lived in Karbach an important part into the lives the first Armenian leader who isn't a car a karabaki that's it that's not what I'm sorry I'm sorry but he came to power on the wave of karabakh movement well he he exploited he exploited unhappiness but I think that he's much less tied emotionally to Karbach than any of his predecessors certainly anybody since terrapetrosium uh my that doesn't mean that I think he's going to make an agreement that any or you know that he's ready for an agreement that Baku would be pleased by entirely I'm simply saying that there were there was a greater sense of fluidity uh until recently and that I think that was one of the reasons one of the factors that led the Iranians and the Russians to move as they did because I completely agree with Brenda that if you remove this CR this conflict if you if if we could simply Proclaim it over okay and it really was that it would be much more difficult for the Iranians and the Russians to cause trouble there are there are other things they would cause trouble in to be sure but it would be much more difficult the problem is that this is not an easy easy uh problem to solve it is easy to declare you know recognize delimited demarcade borders that's not so difficult the question is what kinds of other things are you going are your own is your own population going to insist on either because your population was expelled from an area as it happened with hundreds of thousands of azerbaijanis who want to go back and who want rights to go back and also uh ethnic Armenians who feel they have an investment in this overcoming those kinds of concerns going to be very difficult even if you can get a piece of paper and lines on the map and demarcations of the map so that's it it's it eliminating I what I certainly favor doing vastly more on our part in the west in the United States to promote an agreement I think that has to mean something other than just going back to the men's group I was personally somewhat encouraged by the fact that the new American official who was sent who's been a debt Ambassador designate for this this area was not designated first and foremost as the code the American co-chair of the men's group that opens it up to other possibilities and more effort and I all in favor of that my concern is that we will uh five years from now we'll still be having a conversation about how to solve the Karbach issue I I really fear that and I think that's exactly what uh policy makers in Moscow and Tehran hope for and it's exactly what we should be making sure doesn't happen and that's going to require more attention Brenda is absolutely right people in in Washington don't pay attention to the ethnic composition of uh major Powers it wasn't just Iran that they don't pay attention to that I can personally testify that as late as 1989 your humble servant was the only person employed by the U.S government working full-time on all of the non-russians in the whole Soviet Union if that isn't a lack of attention I don't know what is um and so all of us are lucky that you were paying attention we're reading your article we're very lucky for people what I'm saying is you're absolutely right your book should be on the table of a whole bunch of people although it's probably has too many words in to be on the table of many but it's it's critical people don't understand it they don't understand the southern Azerbaijan issue they don't understand all of the ethnic issues and I didn't have time to talk about it but guess what one of the things that we're going to have to address is that if the rail line goes south through Turkmenistan into into the Tehran Network it's going to go through some ethnic areas that are not azerbaijani but are not Persian either and those areas we should be paying a whole lot more attention to because they may create create real problems uh in the coming months by the way the last wave of anti-regime activities you've seen exactly re-activization of the turkmen of the Caspian Caspian peoples that have been pretty dormant since this since the revolution they were hit so hard by the um hominy's Revolution and forces that but I I I your reference to the turkmen actually turkmender the front cover of the of the book um good for you I think it's completely I 100 agree with you that completely uh uh overlooked and very important uh Fareed let me ask you about uh how is Buck who now looking uh at the you know uh Azerbaijan and Armenia set representatives to Washington met with Jake Sullivan uh to discuss uh the issues of karabakh I mean what was kind of the outcome of those discussions and where where does he where do you think the U.S position is now well again I also would like to refer to what uh yeah the great speaker said uh our colleagues I don't see really uh coherent U.S policy in the South caucuses uh I mean the Clear Vision what uh needs to be done um is Administration trying to do something um and I should note that I mean at least in Azerbaijan and I assume in Armenia too uh with the positive attitude to U.S the Washington's involvement Jake Sullivan where I was meeting uh in in Washington in New York in September and then in Washington uh so uh generally Azerbaijan would like to see also positive U.S involvement and some people says it's the U.S slash EU it can be together um the in EU we have spoilers like France in the United States we have also spoilers U.S Congress and things like that but at least in terms of the real practical job which state departments are doing um I think can be greater input into negotiation process um there is the I think another we didn't much discuss turkey uh I think that turkey is important balancing power in the South caucuses against North Russia and Iran and despite the differences and always the media is bashing turkey Turkish government but uh here the interest of the United States and Turkey and for example the United Kingdom the Britain is very active working together with turkey on a number of security issues a number of geopolitical issues so turkey also can be a important facilitator in the region we've seen the Armenian Turkish conversation recently the The Armenian foreign minister went to Turkey but it should be clear that without Armin azerbaijani progress there won't be any breakthrough in on Turkish Armenian issue too so um to summarize um I think there's the potential of more U.S involvement but still there is not much again we see coherency there is no U.S ambassador in Azerbaijan you see again it will be probable again people like Bob Menendez and some others will be blocking or creating obstacles for the nomination I don't know yeah that's a very good point um and we had a question from someone asking uh about Iran sending the drones to Russia are they using uh the Caspian and shipping uh military equipment through the Caspian uh to Russia how is that or is it being done by air I've seen reports that it's been done by air drones are not very large and you can put them in you can put them in Planes uh and that that uh the risks of putting them across on the Caspian Sea is that they could they could corrode I mean just the air is the Salt Air would be a problem and the train trains are have to go through somebody else's territory so air is air is preference I mean you don't you don't need an an-10 to to move these things you can put you can put drones on you know the the military equivalent of a 707 they're just not large you know you're not talking about something that's 30 feet a wide you're talking about something that's seven or eight feet wide and you can put those on small planes relatively small planes thank you okay well uh does anyone have any com uh concluding comments observations are you uh I know there is a question about Turkmenistan uh what's going on in Turkmenistan the energy uh the projects probably Brenda knows the subject better than me but briefly um yes there is the interest to uh from Turkmenistan to join to the energy Pro projects going from east to west but still took me this done is a bit careful about the Russian possible Russian pressure on and also I think there is the lack of EU also involvement into issue because there was need for investment uh significant investment in energy projects and it should come from Brussels or from the energy companies so maybe Brenda will speak to about his subject and and Farid what would you say in the future with Azerbaijan in Iranian relations were they I mean what do you think is going to happen and as a result of this kind of Crisis and relations in the path forward I I don't see in the near future the situation will be improved much will depend on also internal Dynamic inside Iran um the the indeed the outcome of or let's say the dynamic of the Russian Ukrainian War but um Azerbaijan always tried to manage relationship with neighbors and to be constructive um the uh we should tell I mean it's it's the fact that for example uh for many years it was an official ban in azerbaijani state media to criticize Iran so uh this tension clearly was not created in Azerbaijan or by Azerbaijan but still by Iran so but I I I don't think we will see anything positive in upcoming months okay all right well thank you everyone we really enjoyed your participation today we'll be posting this event online afterwards on YouTube I hope to see you again virtually and in person at some point and thank you again for everyone for watching and listening in today so Brenda would be sort of get a copy of your book so Iran is more than Persia ethnic politics in Iran okay thank you we'll be we'll be on the lookout for it so thank you everyone have a good day thank you
oJLWPRrX_rI,Conference on the Implications of the Russia-Ukraine War for Taiwan: Panel 1- Lessons for Taiwan,"On June 22, 2022, the Jamestown Foundation held a conference on “The Implications of the Russia-Ukraine War for Taiwan.” 

The first panel of the conference assessed lessons learned from the Russia-Ukraine war for Taiwan and featured expert commentary from Michael McDevitt, CNA; Bonny Lin, CSIS, Joe McReynolds, Jamestown Foundation and Russell Hsiao, Global Taiwan Institute. The panel was moderated by John S. Van Oudenaren, Jamestown Foundation. 

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, the international security landscape has changed dramatically. In addition to irrevocably altering the outlook for European security, these developments also have profound implications for the future peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. In particular, many experts have identified parallels and drawn lessons learned from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict for a possible future invasion of Taiwan by the People’s Republic of China.",1,um tweeting on our youtube stream here once i gotta get a go on that oh okay ah better okay sorry i was just saying i've only been doing zoom events for the last year or so so kind of get used to this again all right uh thank you uh everyone uh for joining us this morning i'm john espinau noren editor-in-chief of china brief and china program manager at the jamestown foundation this is the first of two expert panel discussions that we have today and this panel will assess key differences and similarities between the conflict in ukraine and a potential taiwan contingency as well as identify and consider potential lessons learned from ukraine for taiwan we're of course here at jamestown not the only ones to make the link between these two far-flung locales both taiwan's president assaying wen and ukraine's president voldemort zielinski have made a connection uh shortly after russia's invasion in late february 2022 president tsai noted the recent situation in ukraine once again proves that the protection of the country in addition to international solidarity and assistance depends on the unity of the whole people of taiwan and as in in his remarks to the shangri-la dialogue in singapore uh earlier this month president zielinski warned the worlds to quote unquote take pre-emptive measures to prevent china from invading taiwan and in a clear reference to chinese president xi jinping stated that there are quote unquote certain political leaders who continue to keep quote unquote growing their appetites and ambitions and that the world's quote unquote must use preemptive measures against such people this highlights some of the important similarities between taiwan and ukraine smaller democratic states that are both menaced by larger revanchist authoritarian neighbors but of course there are some key differences that i think the panel will discuss on obviously taiwan's an island in asia versus a part of the eurasian land mass ukraine uh enjoys much more international recognition uh than taiwan does with most countries in the world uh abiding by some sort of one china policy right and finally uh china is larger and more embedded into the international system and economy than russia is okay i've talked enough we've got an excellent panel with us here today which is going to talk us through some key lessons and takeaways from ukraine for taiwan and a number of areas the military and strategic lessons the lessons in the information space and the diplomatic and political lessons first to my immediate left we have admiral michael mcdevitt a u.s navy retired who was uh for many years or still a senior fellow at uh cna uh during his 34-year naval career admiral mcdevitt held four at-sea commands including command of an aircraft carrier battle group we have dr bonnie lin who is a senior fellow for asian security and director of the china power project at the center for strategic and international studies csis previously she was at the rand project air force and then at the office of secretary of defense taiwan office we have joe mcreynolds who is the chief for global information operations in cyber at socie and the china security studies fellow at the jamestown foundation he is also the lead editor and co-author of china's evolving military strategy which is a very uh primary source heavy uh resource which i encourage you to check out and then finally last but not least we have russell shao who's the executive director of the global taiwan institute a senior fellow at the jamestown foundation and importantly previously the editor of china brief all right with that uh let me turn it over uh to admiral mcdevitt here who's going to talk us through the some of the military lessons of ukraine for taiwan uh thank you john uh i'd like to express my appreciation to chairman devogel and president howard for inviting me to speak on this topic this is like many of you i suspect over the past few months i've been glued to the television and and haven't read nearly as much about china and much more about ukraine and what's going on in europe i think it's important to recognize that what i have to say today could become totally irrelevant because the russo ukrainian war of 2022 is not yet over in fact it seems more likely that it could evolve into the russo war of 2023 or perhaps even 2024. clearly the eerily euphoria that we found in the media over battlefield successes that somehow foreshadowed an early ukrainian victory uh that euphoria seems to have been muted uh of late uh ukraine might very well emerge victorious but the russian army is demonstrating that it too can adapt it is reverted to the operational approach to war that allowed the red army to destroy the nazi wermach in world war ii a grinding approach as we heard from senator cotton based on massive uses of artillery bombardment followed by combined infantry armor advances this is attrition warfare that favors the side with the most men the most weapons and the most ammunition since the instigator of this war is seized with the iridentis zeal to replicate peter the great's northern great northern war against sweden which incidentally that lasted 21 years we must assume that today's war might go on for some time so what is this so we might what might also consider as hopefully taiwan is doing that any success that ukraine achieves may not be permanent so long as putin or his ilk is in charge in moscow this leads me to the first lesson that taiwan hopefully is absorbing if beijing is unwilling to forego military action to achieve reunification any military success that taipei might achieve should china attack could very well be only a temporary ceasefire and again senator cotton talked about that very problem with ukraine in short i think that ukraine reminds us that like israel or singapore he included finland and i would as well a nation surrounded by powerful large irritants claimants such as taiwan is must be as become a society that must value the virtues of military competence preparedness and resilience it also helps to have a powerful patron in this case all three have the same one the second lesson from ukraine and in my judgment a very important one is the relevance of nuclear weapons putin put his nuclear capabilities on the table from at the outset presumably to remind the world that russia too was a nuclear superpower president biden wisely in my view was quick to forswear any direct combat role for the united states because of the possibility of escalation with one of with the country that is has a treaty guaranteed nuclear weapon is a treaty guaranteed nuclear weapons peer of the united states as the president said the u.s u.s combat involvement could lead to world war iii now china is not close to matching the u.s or russia in nuclear capability but it is on a trajectory to close this gap and has steadfastly refused to become in involved in arms limitations discussions so what does this all mean for taiwan should the prc attack taiwan a u.s president congress and congress could elect to follow the biden example and prohibit any direct u.s combat involvement especially as the pla's inventory of icbms grows that means that u.s involvement could be limited to providing weapons and intelligence assistance and expect the republic of china's armed forces to do all of the fighting in short no u.s combat forces involved i suspect that this is one reason why the prc has seemingly abandoned its minimum deterrent posture there are others but this is certainly uh one of them i think because they they have become to appreciate that a larger nuclear uh weapons force improves its ability to deter direct involvement from washing washington as china's military capabilities grow especially its nuclear forces this is a credible possibility that taiwan must at least consider and act upon that means again to paraphrase what senator cotton said serious planning on mobilization of the entire population and war-related industry expanding the size of the combat combat arms branches of the regular roc army and marine corps taking conscription seriously and expanding the term of service to two years for all eligible individuals making a serious investment in militia and reserve organizations and in that regard there's a great lesson to be learned from the involvement of a various state national guard uh in institutions with ukraine the california national guard my home state uh has had a long involvement uh with ukraine in terms of uh their air power and so it's it's this is an example that we should seriously see what can be done with regard to taiwan where we have various state national guard entities making uh that become partners with one aspect or another of taiwan's military force and this went on by the way for about eight years starting in 2013 in ukraine that the national guard and it's not just the california guard different guards around the country have have partnered with various aspects of ukrainian's military and this is a terrific way to build capabilities and and expose them to modern uh weapons techniques and strategies and uh tactics ability to continue my list of what must be done if taiwan faces the potential of going it alone building up its own stocks of ammunition especially artillery and selected smart weapons one very important lesson from ukraine is how quickly for forces burn through uh ammunition during major combat operations i mean this goes all the way back to the uh first uh war with egypt uh second israeli uh operation against egypt when they surprised the israelis that they the pace of using smart weapons was was staggering and militaries need to understand this that once you once you have these precision weapons the temptation to blast away with them is overwhelming in this regard it's important that roc planners consider how difficult it is likely to be when compared to ukraine i'm sorry i got the wrong page here no no i don't building up stocks in this regard it's important that roc planters uh consider how difficult it is likely to be when compared to ukraine to deliver military supplies to taiwan once the shooting starts it's easy enough to drive or send trains across the border from poland or or romania into into ukraine it's a different story when you have an island that can be blockaded and and which the chinese might be able to achieve air superior or over how you would reinforce taiwan as i say once the shooting starts they supplies can only come via ship or aircraft and depending upon what rules of engagement china beijing uses that could become very problematic another lesson from uk ukraine is that is very relevant to taiwan is the importance of pre-combat intelligence and warning or as the us military calls it inw the u.s was publicly and presumably privately providing credible intelligence that putin was really going to attack but nobody believed him even zelinski up till the last minute many people didn't think putin would actually pull the trigger so just as a ukrainian case it seems likely that the pla would use the pretext of conducting an exercise to mask the buildup of combat power especially that within those combat forces within striking range of taiwan if beijing plans an invasion the collection of shippings and shipping and warships would be obvious the point is it would be difficult for the pla to achieve tactical surprise if if the intelligence is believed and acted upon in short the prc would be unable to mask a buildup for invasion but on the other hand it could can begin a coercive bombardment first with missiles and then by aircraft on a relatively short notice basis what does this mean for taiwan one thing that has been abundantly clear on tv is that a war with a major power is incredibly violent and that it will be impossible to make taiwan bulletproof and i think taipei has to understand that they're going to take hits they're going to take hits and that nobody can stop if deterrence fails missiles will cause a lot of damage this will undoubtedly create confusion and trigger an urge for women and children to be evacuated in ukraine crossing the border to safety to the west was relatively straightforward as we witnessed on television leaving taiwan when it is under fire is will certainly be an immensely more difficult if not impossible uh situation for people who are who are trying to uh escape violence or evacuate this means making sure that nationwide plans for civilian shelters and civil uh civil defense means uh need to be reestablished they probably have since the days of uh the early days of uh bombardments across the uh kamoy and matsu uh and the fear that the mainland would would attack quickly across the strait i'm not i'm not sure if those facilities have been kept active or not it seems unlikely that the prc would permit major airports to remain open an evacuation by sea would need prior arrangements or agreements from beijing to not attack these civilian ships for example cruise liners that could be chartered to to bring out refugees and what have you but again you'd have to get guarantees that not only they would not be attacked by missiles but that the word got out to the submarine force not to shoot torpedoes at them which happened a lot in world war ii uh despite agreements than to not attack hospital ships painted with red crosses and what have you given the proximity of the small islets and the southern ryoku chain to taiwan an exodus of boat people by fishing and other small craft is also uh possible so therefore one thing that taiwan ought to be thinking about is is some quiet discussions with the japanese corpse guard for contingency planning in terms of there's a a large evacuation from taiwan by fishing craft now i'm not a former soldier happily senator cotton was so he could talk more specifically about uh some of the ground combat issues but one of the apparent successes of the ukrainian army has been the use of small relatively short-range drones to geo-locate russian vehicles and personnel so that it's artillery and smart weapons uh can uh take them out hand-launched versions seem to be ubiquitous and and you taiwan has been excuse me ukraine has been capitalizing on on the turkish uavs that were developed uh and have so far proven themselves in combat both in within azerbaijan and now in in ukraine and somehow taiwan needs to figure out a way to get their mitts on those things from turkey is it i guess the best way to put that these systems would be especially useful for dealing with pla airborne and helicopter landed soldiers or landing craft associated with an invasion these systems are directly related to the importance of tactical reconnaissance that can provide targeting for small for smart and weapons this is something that needs to be practiced so small roc ground units and mobilized reserves and what have you are trained and equipped to capitalize on the growing battlefield importance of these systems both the russians and ukrainians have heavy tank armies i mentioned this because i'm aware that a number of american experts have criticized taiwan's desire to purchase u.s tanks i've also been been told that these critiques are in my personal opinion are probably off base it seems to me that the roc army has good plans to use dug-in or riveted tanks to as counter landing systems which seems to be a sensible use for armor on a small island like taiwan to cover the likely invasion beaches this raises the point that perhaps rushing to judgment over what weapons that taiwan should or should not buy needs to be reconsidered in light of what we are learning about combat in ukraine i would hope that the biden administration will be more restrained in its efforts to curate the arms that taiwan wants to purchase the us and nato allies are arming ukraine with systems to use against russian ships in the black sea block blockading ukrainian ports and we ought to be forthcoming about trying to do that for taiwan but for example the administration has just said no to the sale of anti-submarine warfare helicopters for taiwan that are very good at finding submarines the u.s is denied the roc navy a very good capability for dealing with giant pl pla navy submarines trying to blockade taiwan so one might consider if the roc navy can't do it who's going to get stuck with the job my time is up but i want to leave you with a final observation it's really too soon to judge with any confidence what lessons taiwan can draw from the war in ukraine what is clear however is that whatever lessons those may be learning is only the beginning of wisdom they must be put into practice translated into actionable procurement and training plans so with that let me conclude thank you thanks uh admiral mcdevitt uh let's now turn to uh bonnie lynn who's going to talk us through some of china's strategic calculus as regards the use of force specifically in a taiwan situation so bonnie over to you oh sorry so thank you very much um i'm really honored to be part of this panel to address such an important topic that um unsurprisingly is a focus across dc so as john mentioned i'll cover a bit of china's strategic calculus and what that means for taiwan i would just want to caveat that as admiral mcdevitt as well as serena cotton has said it's still very very early to assess what china or the pla might be taking away from this conflict to date we don't have any authoritative writings to go on um but what we could do is try to assess based off of what china or the pla thought before are there any major developments that they're seeing from ukraine that is really changing this and before i go into some of the details let me just note that for many of us that engage quite frequently with the chinese i don't want to i don't want to make the point that there's only one chinese view but there are relatively dominant views and what i hope to portray today is what i think is the more dominant view and before going into the specific let me do mention that overall looking at how china views the situation in terms of its larger strategic environment as well as what the pla needs to invest in from their perspective to better deal with the taiwan problem from their perspective i do not see any actual major changes or breaks in the in china's perspective in fact what ukraine has done is before cause china and the pla to double down in many of their preconceived notions of how to you potentially use force against taiwan and what they should invest in so as i go through some of the details hopefully what i mentioned won't be too surprising because a lot of this has already been as part of pla planning so in terms of the first topic i want to cover is how has china's strategic environment changed and i think it is quite important that to make the point that the ukraine war has very much reinforced a zero-sum mentality from china's perspective perspective a zero-sum in terms of u.s china relations but also as china thinks about cross-street dynamics at first glance this seems quite a puzzling because we're talking about a war in ukraine and it's very far from taiwan but let me unpack this a little bit and you'll be able to understand why china feels so much that it is resonating it is connecting with the russian perspective so the first point i would note that is that um as we all know right before the russian invasion of ukraine president xi jinping signed a joint statement with president putin where the two sides revealed a no limits friendship uh partnership uh based off of that but also the growing china-russia ties what we've seen is the official chinese position is that it's nato expansion and the west quest for absolute security that caused the ukraine conflict so as china and chinese experts are are falling in line many of them under this official perspective it's not it's quite easy then to draw the parallels for their region so as they look in the indo-pacific there's quite a bit of concern that um as the united states from their perspective is also operating very close to china that we from their perspective could also be uh close to provoking a conflict similar to what what nato and united states did in the in europe some chinese experts even believe that nato might further expand to the indo-pacific a second point in terms of us strengthening this overall dark perspective or a zero-sum mentality or a more problematic chinese security environment is that as chinese experts meet and discuss with u.s and western experts on the causes of the ukraine conflict there is very little uh middle ground or or understanding from their perspective of of when we say it's really russian aggression there's very little understanding from their perspective that that is could be the case and when they hear us say again and again we don't understand the chinese position that russia tried to work with the west and was denied and then was forced to use force they're mirror imaging the chinese are mirror imaging and wondering well if the united states cannot understand the russian position on ukraine would the united states ever understand the chinese position on taiwan and that is creating more fears for us intentions as well as more fears in terms of what the united states may have in mind for taiwan the third point i would know is that chinese experts are quite frustrated with how the united states seems to have linked china with russia very very closely and linked to ukraine i've heard a number of chinese experts mention to me that china is not involved in ukraine let's be clear with all the criticism about what china is doing uh with respect to russia china is not militarily involved in ukraine but you almost can't have a conversation these days about what's happening in russia and ukraine without at least some form of blame on china so to chinese expert it's like okay there's a rise in anti-chinese sentiment as a result of ukraine but we're we're really not the aggressors here the fourth point i would know is that um the russian innovation of ukraine as well as china's positions has created a um a greater fault line that we've seen chinese experts point out which is the democracy versus autocracy divide this divide has become much more clear after russian invasion because of the positions that china have taken but also because of how much the united states our close allies and friends that g7 have taken in terms of supporting ukraine this is perceived from the chinese side as it looks to taiwan are many of these countries that are taking the position to support ukraine are these countries these close u.s allies also going to take the same position when it comes to taiwan and finally last but not least in terms of the strategic environment i would note that the chinese are very cognizant that what's happening in ukraine is increasing significant support for taiwan not only in not only domestically within the united states but internationally the chinese are aware that perhaps one of the major lessons that many are taking from ukraine is the international community particularly the g7 is we don't want another ukraine we don't want taiwan to be another ukraine and they're taking that to mean does ukraine does taiwan have to remain uh separate from china and they're viewing that as um a problem for their goals for unification with taiwan so let me move now on to what what this what does this mean for how china may think about use of force for taiwan so i think this is if you can if you combine the the growing zero-sum mentality a growing threat perception of a strategic environment with some potential lessons learned from russia's use force against ukraine i think there actually may be some mixed lessons so i'll lay two of them out and then i don't really know which one is going to be the dominant factor but i think both could be equally um important as we think about how china might use force so as admiral mcdev mentioned when we look at ukraine in 2022 we have to be reminded that russia did take a major military operation in crimea in 2014. that's not lost on china that when russia first went into ukraine in 2014 it was relatively easier militarily for russia but it with eight years of time ukraine was able to increase its defenses in a number of ways that adam mcdevitt outlined including working with national guard acquiring these weapons international support so then when russia went in again in 2022 it was a lot more difficult so if you apply this lesson to taiwan what are you taking away is what you're taking away that if china wants to move on taiwan finish it in one go don't give taiwan eight years in between that could be a potential lesson and that could mean that if china really wants to use force against taiwan do a fast and rap innovation get it done with don't build in time in between so that's one potential way of thinking about it another way that i'm actually hearing more from potential chinese interlocutors is that as china looks at what's happening in ukraine they recognize they don't want to be in a similar situation as russia not so much that china is not willing to use force if it assesses that taiwan may go independent it's that they are assessing that russian use of force right now is not um is not a victory in any of any sense so if china is not yet quite ready to invade taiwan and we can talk about whether china is right now or not but if you assume with me that china is not quite yet ready to invade taiwan but wants to forestall what it sees as a more hostile external environment a trend of taiwan moving more towards gradual independence and u.s salami slicing of our one china policy and our hollowing out of our one china policy these are the chinese perspectives a potential way that china could do so short of an invasion could be finding a reason to provoke a cross-strait crisis so i'm not talking about an invasion it could be something like a blockade it could be something smaller than that a potential example would be the 95 1995-1996 taiwan straight crisis if you look at that from china's perspective it actually was not bad in terms of an overall strategic move because what happened after the 95-96 taiwan strait crisis was that uh then uh president bill clinton provided china with three assurances with the three no's right which basically said that uh the united states would not support taiwan independence there was no two china's no one china won taiwan and the united states would not support taiwan's membership international organizations requiring statehood so if you look at that part of history and you look at what's happening ukraine one potential lesson learned china could have is okay maybe we're not ready to evade maybe the costs are quite high maybe we need a couple of years to digest all the potential lessons learned that so the pla could improve our military capabilities if we do want to take a really big operation later on but in the meantime let's use force to make it clear demonstrate to the americans and their allies and partners that that china is set and resolve to unify with taiwan because as what as in the case of russia just talking about that the russians were not able to convince nato were not able to convince ukraine through their words so they had to use force to demonstrate that um so let me also in addition to this touch on a couple of other things that admiral mcdevitt mentioned so emma mcdevitt mentioned in terms of preparation changes for preparation for one thing that i am very worried about is that as china moves forward and thinks about taiwan it could be using the increasing this frequency and scale large-scale exercise exactly to mask its intentions because it it sees the from russia's in some ways failure of russia to do so to embrace element of surprise which has been relatively foundational to how china thinks about the use force that if it wants to embrace that it might maybe a military exercise would be able to do so other pla lessons learned including include for example importance of logistics and equipment which i think we've touched on a bit and of course the fact that china also needs to ensure that it has its own stockpile and is able to maintain its supply chains in terms of wartime operations i'm sure joel will talk about this but information dominance is absolutely critical one of the other potential lessons learned the pla might be taking away is that if it needs to move on taiwan it might need to take it might need to engage in a much faster operation a decapitation strike they don't want taiwan to have the linsky moment or maybe a president's high moment right they want to be able to take out the leadership such that the morale of the taiwan army would be or army people would be able to collapse very quickly we briefly talked about nuclear signaling and i want to uh um maybe impact it just slightly more i absolutely agree with what will mcdevitt mention but i do think from the chinese perspective they're not certain that the united states would be deterred from inter conventional intervention in a taiwan conflict if it signals nuclear weapon because they do recognize that our the u.s relationship with taiwan has been quite different from ukraine they recognize given all the statements from this administration prime administrations that we are despite our strategic uh ambiguity our problems we're quite committed to taiwan um on as well as on that point i do my personal belief is if china invaded taiwan tomorrow i do believe the united states would send much more than providing intelligence i believe we would actually send conventional forces but that's again my own my own personal opinion we wouldn't but i do agree with you taiwan shouldn't be banking on that right it should be able to plan for in for the work their worst case scenario that we would go through that scenario right um and then the final last thing i would just mention is as we try to digest potential chinese lessons learned for how it might change its operations or adapt its operations against taiwan i think it's also important to think about what i call the second order effects a lot of what i've been talking about is what china could directly take away from what it sees as ukrainian successes or failures or russian successive failures but china is also very good historically at learning at what is the united states learning what is taiwan learning what is japan learning and one thing that we i worry about is as we talk about stockpiling right for example if we um if if one of the recommendations is for taiwan to stockpile not only within taiwan but also in u.s military bases near taiwan so we can easily overcome the difficulties of resupplying taiwan well a second order effect is that those u.s bases whether those are in japan or elsewhere will be incredibly vulnerable to your first strike from china a preemptive strike from china in a large-scale chinese attack on taiwan because china will want to take those out so just a word of caution as we're thinking through these issues think not only of what china is learning now but if we were to take particular actions what would be the chinese reaction and we might find ourselves in a situation where some of the measures that we're taking to support taiwan could be perceived from the chinese side as they would need to escalate a lot more in order to achieve their own objectives so i'll wrap it up here thank you sorry all right let's yeah sorry about that um all right we're gonna go now to joe mcreynolds who's going to talk us through some of the lessons um for cyber and information uh joe over to you uh thank you very much sean um there we go uh so uh i've actually just received a grant uh in my uh china fellow at jamestown role uh from the smith richardson foundation to to spend six months starting in july studying what china is learning from the ukraine war so uh if i could time travel and find out what the conclusions of that project would be it would be very helpful for this but i will offer uh some notional thoughts and and uh i've sort of grouped this into three prior assumptions that china has about information warfare and and especially cyber warfare uh three assumptions that uh as best we can tell so far in this very early stage that the ukraine conflict may cause them to rethink and three assumptions that it may cause them to confirm and context here is that the general assessment of information operations in the ukraine war is that it's been kind of underwhelming that uh overall sort of pictures people had in their mind prior to uh prior to this conflict of you know in modern or future warfare you know winning without firing a shot through the power of information at the end of the day it's you know it's men and bullets and munitions and um certainly c4s are very important but that at that russia's vaunted uh cyber and information warfare capabilities that were said to be number two in the world are so far really underperforming what people feared and so that of course leaks into chinese views of the conflict um but just to start off with i think the most foundational thing uh that they they may be rethinking is that the cyber domain or the network domain as as they say say in the pla that the cyber the idea that the cyber domain is offense dominant uh for a while you had this debate uh within the pla between cyber realists and cyber institutionalists where realists were very focused on uh building up offensive and defensive cyber power um institutionalists more focused on on norms and institutions that govern the global information space for example control of backbone servers and things like that um but neither of them really neither of these groups which often kind of overlap with each other but neither of them were really taking seriously that idea that the domain might be defense dominant uh at its core everyone was presuming offense dominance people talked a lot about the idea that you don't want to be constructing a cyber maginot line that you create all these uh defenses that are then overtaken by uh new technological or or or uh tactical doctrinal developments uh and you're just sitting there twiddling thumbs uh but there's actually a a sort of a defense not that's not about strictly what percentage of cyber attacks do we fend off and that's more defense through resilience and defense and depth and that's something that when you look at for example um the mention in the keynote about starlink the standing up ad hoc networks uh or using existing networks in unconventional ways taiwan's ptt network uh jumps out at me as an example of of a very unusual uh national level network that most people outside of taiwan don't know about but that could play an important information role in a conflict um as it's outside of the standard standard internet um all of the all of these things suggest potentially a defense dominant domain and that's that would would mean one of the most foundational consensuses in pla writings about cyber information warfare having to be uh just wiped out and started and starting starting over from scratch almost now to something that i think is being confirmed but with a bit of an asterisk the importance of allies and partners in the uh information domain of conflict especially a lot of media reporting about and just be clear i have no um i have no specialized knowledge in this this is all just unclassified um media reporting but the the u.s role in ukraine's successful targeting of russian generals is that the vast majority of russian generals killed in action in this conflict so far have been um killed with some assistance from um america america's uh provided intelligence now china has long held that that allies and partners are really the linchpin of of success or defeating a conflict and from their scenario not about having formal alliances china you know differs from that but but about putting sufficient daylight between the us and its allies and partners uh in order to to provoke neutrality and so the the way in which uh the u.s really deftly rallied um european countries uh on things such as financial sanctions and other measures uh in in this conflict i think is is definitely significantly um worrisome for china though the asterisk is that one major component of our support for ukraine has been that key segments of the us public are very are are particularly supportive of support for an ally uh in europe the idea that they or a partner in europe the idea you know that that you know war shouldn't be coming to our doorstep that you know you hear about you know they have blonde hair and blue eyes they look like us and for those of us who don't have blonde hair and blue eyes sort of like you know who you mean when you say us but but this is uh this is a thing that impacts poll numbers um uh numbers in poll numbers for u.s support for ukraine have actually started to soften recently they're still overall decent but uh the question of how the u.s public would respond to a conflict where we might be doing more than providing material support and where the people doing the fighting are not blonde haired in blue-eyed and are over in asia and what that means uh for america's politics are something that that are is you know difficult to discuss in the the difficult you know legacy of racial politics in america but the chinese of course have no qualms about discussing uh how to use that division to their advantage in a taiwan conflict uh so you could imagine a whole uh psyops campaign as an influence campaign focused on you know asia is so far away you know you know does the should the us really be poking its nose into other parts of the world that aren't you know it's you know the us is an atlantic a european power um and so that that's that's something that i think you know folks in this room are are are pretty immune to but uh the the general public um which generally tends much more isolationist than the u.s uh foreign policy community uh that that may be a thing we are susceptible to um but that actually leads us to a major point of rethinking which is their psyops plan for the u.s population in the event of a crisis or conflict um russia sorry china has often looked to russia as a model in that regard for example the um the global arm of cctv um remaking cgtn that was specifically done in the mold of russia today consciously trying to take what they saw as russia today's successes such as in disinformation around the 2016 election as as a as a model for what china could do unfortunately as as they're now seeing russia today and and other arms uh you know of russian missing disinformation are not very effective when they're public enemy number one and it's and it's a full-on shooting invasion uh so the the limits of their global um information plan obviously the extent to which uh ukrainians have have truly rallied uh to their own cause uh it will will also give them pause on the front of their their plan for taiwan focused uh disinformation and this is something also where um you need to look at at linguistics capabilities because that's the logistics of information ops that's you know you say an army moves on its stomach well um you know propaganda global propaganda moves on linguistics capabilities and russia had has developed a much stronger uh english language like information ops linguistics capability than china has um china of course excels at chinese language uh miss and disinformation aim so aimed at taiwan but they they are well behind russian their ability to target uh the u.s popu population or or allied countries populations and and even russia's uh superior capabilities have so far looked largely inadequate um now that leads us to something that i think is being confirmed a view of theirs that's been confirmed which is they've seen the us as i believe the phrase was the world's only cyber superpower uh or in some cases they refer to us as a network hegemon the idea that through a combination of technical capabilities uh human capital and uh institutional position uh for example our control over uh global backbone servers for the internet um that that the u.s stands in a class of its own um in terms of uh in terms of overall comprehensive cyber power and that may not necessarily be true uh for more tailored or narrow military-focused operations but not only china but also the global infosec community has long seen the u.s is number one russia is number two china is number three um i've seen almost nobody that's that's put uh put china as number two russia is number three and and set aside for a second the idea that that's just a very arbitrary unscientific concept the idea that you can rank uh comprehensive cyber power um to the extent that those are concepts that have currency in chinese thinking this is another issue where they're looking at the the number two uh really falling down on the job and saying if the number two doesn't hold a candle to really doesn't hold a kennel to the number one and is underwhelming in in a shooting war and we're number three what does that say about how we're going to do um and when you add to that their sense of precariousness with their own information environment the widespread belief within the pla that that launching and losing a war for taiwan wouldn't just be embarrassing it might be a threat to regime stability as it would undermine their their domestic messaging about about their their mandate uh for control uh that's that may give them real pause um when it comes to pulling the trigger on a conflict um something that i think the two more things here one confirm one rethink um i think this confirms uh china's this conflict confirms china's view of uh network weapons cyber weapons as in a memorable phrase they refer to them as as often single-use chopsticks like that you break them apart and you're not putting them back down the idea that you know once say a zero day or or some other form of network access is used uh that the adversary grows resilient not only to that particular zero day but also to categories of attacks stuxnet used a you know usb thumb drive as one of its main critical avenues of penetrating an air gap network and the world's uh military powers are much more wise now uh to usb uh thumb drives uh being able to execute code in air-gapped systems and so it's not just about the specific zero days used in stuxnet or the specific um specific uh industrial control systems targeted there that's that's about a broader categorical uh type of resiliency and so um you cr one theory that you see a lot in writings about the ukraine war is that ukraine's experience of offensive cyber ops from russia in in in various forms from 2014 uh especially onward gave them nearly a decade as on the mission disinformation front uh to to adapt and harden and and that that is um that is something to to ideally be avoided um in a uh in a taiwan conflict but the the challenge with that brings us to our final rethink um there's a lot a number of pla analysts in this room may have heard of the concept of integrated network and electronic warfare um there's an evolved concept uh i i knew there's an evolved concept that's it's less well-known iifw but also very influential that came later integrated information and firepower warfare um yeah yeah jung in his lectures on the science of information operations uh really popularized that within the pla and the idea is um preference for first strikes that coordinate uh information and kinetic operations to achieve a combined effect that's larger than the sum of its parts and and that uh that is sort of is is key to victory that you're you're striking the opponent's forces and their c4 sr at the same time now we've always kind of looked at iifw and said okay yes in magical christmas land where everything breaks your way sure but like in a taiwan scenario you launch your information operations uh to to uh support your your in your fleet uh you're coming coming across the taiwan strait and the weather shifts in the taiwan strait it's no longer the right timing say for an invasion or uh your the effects you were hoping for in taking down uh information systems you were hoping you'd take them down for a day and you took them down for an hour or ten minutes or not at all or you took them down for a day but there was resiliency that you uh weren't properly accounting for um just so many things that can go wrong in trying to coordinate these uh very uh diverse forms of warfare and and and ukraine is now providing real examples of that um like russian targeting of i think via sat viasat however you pronounce it um it was a it was successful in the extent to the extent that they they took down took down those nodes but at the same time they were back up and running uh very rapidly there was there was no real uh degradation of um ukraine's capabilities in that regard over over a longer stretch and there was not the sufficient coordination with on-the-ground operations um and that's that's land operations that's not even talking about the the challenges of coordinating with with naval and air operations uh that the timing didn't line up to pre to produce a measurable positive impact for russia's ground operations um so coordination is hard battlefield damage assessment is hard uh all all of this is very difficult and uh for again going back to china's fears that underperforming here isn't just you know egg on their face and then return to something resembling the status quo it's it's potentially you know the end of the regime that kind of uncertainty uh in a functioning uh you know chinese military academic system may lead to rethinks but that's i think one of the the bigger overarching issues here which is um a lot of times at least in in the writings that we get uh even the the pla internal distribution only writings that we sometimes uh get through through fun or spooky means um you see certain kinds of criticism uh allowed of uh well we're making progress but we have so much farther to go and and you know this this and this could be improved but you don't see them saying wow our whole operational concept is a cluster from top to bottom we need a total rethink our senior leadership is is invested in an idea that's just never going to happen that's you don't see those kind of pieces uh for the most part you can sometimes of course pick them up in in attract dialogues in in informal conversations and things like that uh so that's i think going to be a big challenge as we try and understand what china is and isn't rethinking in light of ukraine is uh the the fact that we're trying to sort of read between the lines of of a system where officers are writing a lot they're publishing a lot they're clearly um thinking a lot but but are they able to write freely and openly when it touches on red lines of operational concepts and strategic concepts from top level leadership and with that i will turn it over to russell all right thanks uh joe for bringing things full circle and we know with china and taiwan everything comes back to politics so um russell's gonna talk us through some of the political and uh diplomatic lessons uh for taiwan from ukraine russell over to you all right um well thanks glenn willem john for organizing today's panel discussion and inviting me to participate uh with such a distinguished group of co-panelists it always feels like a homecoming uh when i'm here at the jamestown event where i first cut my teeth as a junior analyst 15 years ago so feels like another era but glad to be able to reconnect and continue uh to contribute to the good work that jamestown uh does um so i've been assigned to talk about these diplomatic and economic uh dimensions uh or lessons of the ukraine conflict for taiwan and so uh let me be succinct as much as possible i'm cognizant of the time that uh that that remains right now let me be uh the first on the lesson from the diplomatic front um i think the international diplomatic response to russia's invasion of ukraine has been impressive the rallying of the international community to express their moral support as well as outrage against russia's naked aggression acts in a way as a pressure on moscow not to escalate its military operations for tactical military objectives it imposes a psychological effect on the russian population and also provides support to the morale of the ukrainian resistance i think these are all general elements that applies to what lessons taiwan can learn from the ukrainian conflict for taiwan now what are the specific lessons for taiwan though my first observation about this matter concerns how beijing has been has gone at length to distinguish the case of ukraine from taiwan uh while there are indeed notable differences beijing's legal argument about the difference between taiwan ukraine rests on the issue of sovereignty beijing's logic is that because the majority of nations maintain diplomatic relations with the prc they would not or should not be justified to respond similarly to a conflict over taiwan because it would violate its sovereignty yet this categorical assertion of sovereignty deliberately misinterprets an essential nuance in how many countries approach the issue of taiwan's legal status so according to data from 2017 on the diplomatic regulations of the prc granted the number has changed somewhat in the intervening years due to a loss of some diplomatic partners of the republic of china but the features remain essentially the same here between maintains diplomatic relations with 173 nations and all about 36 signed communicates with beijing but among those 137 countries with communication with china there are three distinct categories in how those countries treated the issue of sovereignty prc sovereignty claims over taiwan so 52 states recognized prc sovereignty over taiwan some of those countries include portugal south africa as well as israel 29 states use a vague language to express their attitudes uh towards prc sovereignty over taiwan this includes the united states japan and canada for example and then 56 states does not mention the issue at all with regards to prc sovereignty over taiwan and those include germany ireland mexico therefore there are a total of 121 states this is 2017 numbers are either vague and do not address the issue of prc sovereignty over taiwan so a question a follow-on question that one may be asking and this leads into my second observation is does taiwan's lack of um membership create a legal obstacle or moral prohibition for the international community to respond in the event of china's invasion of taiwan i think the answer is no the perception that it could stem from could inhibit the international response comes from actually prc's deliberate distortion of un resolution 2758 that narrowly disposed of the question of which entity holds the seat of china in the united nation and which has been misused deliberately by the prc as a sort of a form of u.n wide one china principle which is not while u.n membership would certainly help taiwan in his quest for international legitimacy it would neither effectively bar nor be the decisive factor in ensuring taiwan security as an institution arguably the u.n has been proven to be quite ineffective for responding to the ukraine conflict and it will have little role in a military conflict like in ukraine over taiwan ultimately it will depend on the decision of individual governments and their people to decide whether and how to respond to a conflict over taiwan those decisions are going to be governed by national self-interests and i would also add concerns about what a post-invasion region and also world would look like countries are not going to respond because they feel obligated to do so because the u.n charter necessitates them to respond but to be sure the absence of diplomatic relations will complicate taiwan's ability to generate the type of official support and hinder some forms of cooperation in the absence of a military conflict that will galvanize the type of uh the changes that will be necessary and more troubling is that this situation will likely exist in this gray zone until a conflict arises beijing however should be well aware that at the outset of military conflict and hostility the situation could very well change very fast as some of my previous panelists have alluded to first and foremost with almost a guarantee a declaration of deterrent independence by taiwan for washington's part is this sovereignty question a bar to a military response i think the president of the united states has made that clear and that the answer is a no the most recent statement made by president biden on the subject of u.s commitment to taiwan's defense was made while on his trip to asia and notably in japan during his stop in tokyo reporter asked him and i quote you didn't want to get involved in the ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons are you willing to get involved militarily to defend taiwan if it comes to that without hesitation the president responded yes the reporter followed up you are the president nodded his head that's the commitment we made and he added president allen we agree with the one china policy we signed on to it and all the intended agreements made from there but the idea that that it meaning taiwan can be taken by force just taken by force is just not appropriate it would dislocate the entire region and be a action another action similar to what happened in ukraine uh so it's a burden that's even stronger end quote this is of course as senator cotton alluded to in his opening remarks not the first time that president biden has made such statements and has expressed his views on u.s commitments to taiwan's defense on one occasion he likened it to u.s commitment to nato and on another occasion he vowed to protect taiwan to be clear the united states does not have a mutual defense treaty with taiwan since 1979 but provisions within the taiwan relations act especially sections 2b 4 through 6 can be read to indicate a broad commitment to taiwan's defense my third and final observation regarding the diplomatic front which is really more of a question is whether the lack of a more widely held disposition on taiwan's legal status lead to a more or less effective defense of taiwan i think that is a critical question that i think needs to be considered deliberately and carefully in the months and years ahead as the threats facing taiwan becomes more acute i would note here in this context that in march of this year against the backdrop of russia's invasion of ukraine the former secretary of state mike pompeo stated that the united states should re-establish diplomatic relations with taipei his statement which was delivered at this at the heritage foundation foundation bears repeating here it became very clear to me that one of the most one of the central features of making sure that taiwan has the capacity to defend itself is the world recognizing what we all know to be true there is a simple truth it is not part of china that if it became part of china this wouldn't be reunification this would be an aggressive action that destroyed the sovereignty of an independent country and for an awfully long time the west has moved away from this under coercive threats from the chinese communist party and no leaders in the west have been prepared to say the simple fact which is that this is an independent sovereign nation and we ought to help it protect its own sovereignty i think it is time that the united states do so end quote so while the ukraine conflict has certainly created a rallying effect between taiwan especially in japan australia czech republic uh lithuania slavakia even south korea for that for that matter but do these countries even the united states included have the legal and political means to effectively do so under current diplomatic constraints again i'll leave this third third observation as more of a question than an answer so move on to the economic one quickly just as important if not more are the lessons to be learned from the economic uh less the economic front of the ukraine conflict my first observation is that there is an urgent need to develop a set of tools based on a coordinated and even preemptive geoeconomic strategy for enhancing integrated deterrence against china's military aggression china has been leveraging its economic strength with great capacity and capabilities to advance its comprehensive national power to further its geopolitical objectives the free world has not developed a compromi a competitive counter strategy to counteract this type of influence and is utilizing trade policy investment policy economic and uh financial means uh financial monetary policies energy strategy uh cyber tech all of these means that as uh you've effectively utilized under a very uh a very a coordinated industrial policy i think it is clear that beijing is concerned by the use of economic measures in the case of russia's invasion of ukraine i do think it's instructive that the ccp has been convening econ and financial experts to address the very types of sanctions that the west has been imposing on the pr on russia in the case that it was imposed upon the prc an event of a invasion of taiwan i think this is indication that the general secretary is very concerned about the how how these economic measures would impact uh his regime i think while it would be far costlier to impose wide-ranging sanctions on the prc than russia i would be i would argue that effective sanctions which are carefully calibrated credibly signaled and executed could be a more powerful asset to deter in the case of china than russia clearly it had failed in the case of moscow and this is the reason because is because the ccp is arguably more vulnerable to the political effects of economic sanctions for one china also has a wealthier population with more to lose and the ccp arguably has a much lower threshold for political instability than russia obviously this is i do not have the time to go at length in terms of how what i think about that my second observation is that tawa needs to accelerate the diversification of economic and trade investments to alternative markets taiwan exports to the prc including hong kong uh its exports reached a record high in 2021 and accounted for 42.3 percent of taiwan's total exports in 2021 it is in this context why i think a u.s taiwan bilateral trade agreement a free trade agreement is critically important at a strategic level to provide an outlet for taiwanese investments in capital a recent heritage foundation study also found that an fta between the united states and taiwan would have positive economic effects for both countries total trade would increase by 6.2 billion annually for the united states and 3.8 billion annually for taiwan my third and final observation on this matter is that we should be under no illusions that economic measures alone would be sufficient to deter china military denial would be absolutely vital but i do think the economic sanctions component is it should be a necessary component and could potentially tilt the balance towards deterring beijing which should be the ultimate goal so finally i would just just close in stating that that there is obviously a spectrum of potential conflict scenario over taiwan from limited military operations to full-scale invasion uh i think the most recent invasion of ukraine of course should not be seen in isolation as bonnie referenced also the annexation of crimea in 2014 uh it should be another example in which we need to study and turn carefully in terms of what types of operations china could be engaged in it is therefore critical that allies and partners are engaging in in high-level security consultations with taipei to figure out and have figure out a way to respond to the spectrum of conflicts that can arise and coordinate roles and missions uh respectively and i'll conclude there thank you thanks uh so much russell i know we're almost that time but i'd like to give a little extra time uh possible to allow for some audience uh q a because we have such a stellar uh audience uh here with us today so if you can just uh raise your hand and and introduce yourself and pose your question and potentially even say who you might be asking see our professor waldron to you sir forgive me for not standing up but i have a very bad back problem i'd like to make two points first i think and i would commend russell in particular for bringing this out although all of you spoke of it the sooner or later we are going to have to do what mike pompeo said uh there is a saying in chinese to point at a deer and call it a horse and you hear this all the time uh and there is abso there is no reason uh that we should uh deny diplomatic recognition to taiwan and there's every reason that we should remember that britain until 1971 maintained a consulate in taiwan in those days of course it was expected that taiwan was soon going to liquidate itself but that has not uh occurred and the price that britain paid for that was that instead of having an embassy in peking they had a legation it seems to me that given the basic lack of utility of the us embassy in beijing that it would be a very good trade and i believe that it is essential if we're going to get this taiwan issue settled down that some form of diplomatic relations official relations be established at a level at which security treaty can be signed i think that this is very very important and uh of course our china policy so-called has been based on the idea mr kissinger's idea which was the the shock of usd recognition which of course he never did he that was that was brzezinski and uh the other the the they uh rushed into this i think the reason that ike never did it was that he could never figure out what was going to happen to taiwan and ike one had always had not just the beginning of the story but the end but we we have to do this and once that's done a lot of pieces will fall into place the second point i'd like to make is that has to do with nuclear capacity i ask myself these days because remember that the denuclearization and non-proliferation are very basic to the whole american approach to foreign policy and i think this is quite wrong i think that if the country has nuclear weapons the only way you deter them is with other nuclear weapons there's no conventional deterrence of nuclear weapons and i ask you if we look at today's world let us suppose that sweden were a nuclear power which she's very close to being let us suppose that germany were a nuclear power let us suppose that japan were nuclear power let us suppose that south korea were a nuclear power and let us suppose that taiwan were a nuclear power taiwan after all has twice been at the threshold of uh creating nuclear weapons and their one of their smartest generals told me that you know nine months that the maximum the japanese ambassador has said to me don't you understand don't the chinese understand that we could do it overnight i don't think they do well what i would say is that although our arms control community would be appalled by this situation i think it actually would be a more stable situation it is a tragic fact that we are at in a nuclear world but we have to face it and that means that if you know the other that guy has got a nuclear weapon then our allies have to have them and uh we have to stop acting as if somehow the way this thing is going to start is that taiwan provokes china somehow this is a very false psychological equation and the last thing i would say is that in chinese there is a saying that foreign relations is simply an exp an extension of domestic politics and we must understand that that the reason that china is adopting the policy she is has nothing to do with a deep desire to get hold of taiwan as i put it to the dread tiger yang why do you i didn't quite say it this way why do you and moan about taiwan all the time you say nothing about mongolia and he was very angry but he sent someone around to talk to me the reason is that when mao went to see stalin miles said we'd like to have mongolia and stalin said well young mao in fact we russians are going to have it and even though mongolia has been run by china much much longer than taiwan ever has been you don't hear irredentism about mongolia some chinese will kind of grumble about it but it's all focused on taiwan why is it because the status of taiwan is not nailed down and i think that the number one priority someone's got to grasp the nettle and we've got to establish some kind of official diplomatic relationship with them ideally we should do this in conjunction with japan i suppose the last thing i should say is there are two countries that i don't hear names in this discussion number one is japan i believe that the chinese are more scared of japan than they are of the united states because they've had experience with the japanese and if mr kishida says you know we're you're not gonna you're not gonna get into a fight about taiwan without taking hassan if you look at the map you can't get to taiwan without violating japanese territory and the other is india and india is way over on the other side of china now there was a time when india was sort of the gang that can't shoot straight but i was there on the day of uh they tested their h-bomb and uh the late uh i will the late uh defense minister said this is aimed at china so we have to look at it in a multilateral way and this is really a comment it's not a question so thank you very much well let's kind of two two parts there the first is if we were to do as arthur suggests right and extend diplomatic recognition to taiwan what impact would that have because we have heard from people that this would potentially precipitate a conflict right but arthur is saying would actually do the opposite right and the second question is i think arthur somewhat maybe channeling kenneth waltz here a little bit sorry would would proliferation in asia increase the security of the u.s allies so i know there's a lot to chew on there uh arthur doesn't give easy questions uh does anyone want to take this on to start joe admiral mcdevitt well just i'll just say he may very well be right that if we recognize had an established official diplomatic uh relations with taiwan that china would just simply uh uh swallow hard and and uh and tough it out and have to live with it now the other the other side of the coin is uh it may start a war so if you're in the white house uh how risk tolerant are you are you willing to roll the dice uh and what would the amer we heard already from joe what would public opinion in the united states say about essentially the united states provoking a war with china so i think i think politically it's a non-starter i would just add on the uh allies and partners front that if if we if we believe that a conflict over taiwan that the u.s being able to hang close with its allies and partners is is key to prevailing in that sort of conflict uh kicking off the conflict by pissing off all of our allies and partners with a a unilateral move that that suddenly creates a global geopolitical crisis uh might not be the best way to have them you know willing to you know commit blood and treasure to our side uh and that's something i i think the question would be is do you think we could do this not as a unilateral move but as a multilateral move and and my sense uh from at least the the contacts i have in u.s ally and partner countries uh is is that there there would likely not be a lot of appetite for that um outside of outside of the united states foreign policy community uh at least not in not in the current governing uh coalitions of major ally and partner countries i have a hard time imagining say uh germany or us or australia for that matter under under albany's uh signing on to that um maybe maybe one day and and i would definitely rethink it if it was something we could do as a like a true multilateral move not like iraq war style multilateralism where you know micronesia is on our side or whatever but like where these days we don't even have micronesia on our side so um you know back to backwards movement on that front but uh if we if we really got a bunch of key players all aligned then then yes i could definitely uh rethink uh how that would play out the false assumptions that govern the nixon kissinger diplomacy we finally say goodbye to them and i should mention the one china policy this is not to be found in any of the canonical documents where it came from nobody knows i think it came during the clinton administration i think it came in a letter from winston lord which i have seen and when i mentioned it to an nsc member he was shocked and said we never gave that away and we're now so ill-informed about our own policy history that we have i think the ambassador saying that our whole our whole policy rests on a one china policy so we're not very good shape all right i think we're gonna wrap up now uh thanks for a great uh panel discussion uh tremendous amount uh to think about oh all right you know what actually we're gonna give uh president's prerogative here uh so uh mr glenn howard uh glenn glenn glenn hey thank you everyone uh i admire mcdevitt i wanted to ask you a question and then i'm going to ask also russell uh question you brought up the very interesting analogy to the 73 war in the middle east which uh many people in this room probably don't remember but the ammunition shortages israeli army how the u.s had to airlift that uh you hit on a really important point about how the ukraine war has really exhausted our own ammunition and european nato allies ammunition so you're obviously been thinking about this in the case of taiwan i wish you could just kind of talk about that a little bit more and and the analogy with ukraine and or the differences between ukraine and taiwan you know could you just discuss the 100 you got 100 miles of water between the two so obviously russia is right next door to ukraine so there's some logistical issues involved how much from a naval perspective as you say and us getting supplies to taiwan and the fact that we're not giving them asw capabilities how does that kind of affect them in this what have you been thinking about all these ammunition shortages and just kind of in that general sentence scenario and russell uh armor the taiwanese arm that's an interesting idea about their lack of armor and desire to have armor some people think they don't need to get uh tanks from the u.s so i i realize you're at night you you stay up reading about armor so uh but anyway i wanted to ask that if you could just talk about it well glenn you've you've asked a question it would take a good long time to answer um but briefly uh the issue of uh supplying ukraine is obviously you have contiguous friendly states that you can uh use rails and truck to ship uh ammunition and whatever it's it after all is a bulk quantity it you can airlift it in so the the issue is uh china has the ability with taiwan the issue is china has the ability with their uh shore based sams right along the coast of china uh to uh have sam envelope that covers most of taiwan and besides that they have their own uh have a lot of fighter planes and what have you so trying to fly in uh in a hostile environment there uh ammunition uh what i would call with flat fat airplanes full of bullets you're it's going to be difficult uh unless you can gain at least temporary air superiority over the island so you can land some things otherwise you're running the risk that all of those airplanes are going to be shot down similarly ships carrying ammunition uh um to uh uh first of all in taiwan you have to have a port to be able to actually unload this stuff so you're talking about khao shong and ki lang and a couple others where are they they're all on the uh mainly on the west coast uh there i don't know that there are any ports on the east coast that you can get to but still you those ships have to be able to uh sail through submarine-infested waters face the problem of anti-ship ballistic missiles you know those can asbms are not just good for hitting aircraft carriers they're good for hitting just big ships uh and so you have a real problem there and so then you have to try to achieve some sort of sea control for a period of time so that you could run the ammunition in there so it it would be a combat uh organization problem russia has not chosen to try to interdict trains and trucks and what have you bringing ammo into ukraine they could but in the process they could widen the war by directly involving nato that situation does not obtain in in east asia and i don't know that we're exhausting our stocks of weapons we certainly are running them down uh the problem the immediate problem for europe is ukraine ukrainian artillery is russia is russian-made it's russian artillery and the west the former uh soviet black states in eastern europe have given most of that back to to ukraine so they can shoot it it's mostly gone now ukraine is going to depend upon u.s artillery and u.s ammunition but they're still getting that and nato is essentially based upon u.s standards or nato standards so that's a very encapsulated response to some of the questions well uh after what dave it's uh you know very detailed response i'm going to give you a very broad and general response the general response to your question about armor since i do not spend all my days reading about armors uh but i would say i would answer your question in the context of that in the absence of a defense treaty between the united states and taiwan there needs to be a sufficient level of clarity that would be enable the two sides to really come to a clear division of labor in terms of missions and roles uh and in the absence of that there uh you know taiwan needs to prepare for a spectrum of phases and uh conflict in all phases of military operations and as such you know the dispute uh disagreements with regards to whether or not tanks are are necessary in the in in the event of a uh of a taiwan conflict it you know i think rests on that similarly you know the the issue with regards to asw the implications there is that you guys are saying we got it right that's the implication that's the implication they're saying hey look u.s is saying we got that let us take care of that right um but you know i think um so i think it you know to answer your question that's really the you know taiwan has to swallow the i believe pill on that one uh really last question bonnie you recently did a war game on taiwan did you deal at all with the resupply issue in that in the game the game that you did for msnbc and cns and if so can you tell us how that played out thank you we didn't really deal with the resupply issue but um i think it's a very critical one and that's where i was talking about as taiwan thinks about its resupply issue it's not only about stocks on the island but much closer to the island and because that could make it much more rapid but a lot of the issues animal mignon already addressed in terms of how difficult it is all right well thank you for a very uh wide-ranging uh panel i was kind of feeling a little bit very concerned after listening to admiral mcdevitt and bonnie and then after i listened to joe and russell i felt a little bit heartened so these things are kind of so multifaceted so thank you so much we have our we're going to have a lunch uh and then um we'll pick up i think probably closer to 12 30 looking at policy implications for the u.s so thanks everybody [Applause]
F2OxezI_MsI,Posing problems without shacking up - Oriana Skylar Mastro,"Posing problems without shacking up: Prospects for a Sino-Russian alliance and implications for Asia-Pacific security.

Is China forming a balancing coalition against the United States, in particular with Russia? The most recent scholarship does not address China’s balancing strategy because it focuses on explaining secondary states’ response to China’s rise. 

Work in the realist tradition does predict China will ally with other nations but does not provide insights into security behaviour short of alliances, which more accurately characterizes Beijing’s strategy to date.

In this seminar, Mastro presents a theoretically and empirically informed way of measuring alignment degree and scope, which uses metrics relevant to understanding alignment between great powers. Evaluating the China-Russia relationship within this framework, she argues that their alignment is narrow in scope, but deep – though the latter is reflected more in terms of mutual enhancement of military capabilities than direct coordination of security policies. While the Sino-Russian relationship is unlikely to become a formal mutual defence alliance, China is pursuing a limited subset of alignment activities with Russia that would impact Asia-Pacific security through its effects on U.S. military operations in critical contingencies. This research has implications for the stability of unipolarity, alliance politics, and balancing theory more broadly.

Speaker:

Oriana Skylar Mastro is a Center Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, a Foreign and Defense Policy Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and an inaugural Wilson Center China Fellow. She is an international security specialist, with research focusing on Chinese military and security policy, war termination, and coercive diplomacy.

respects to the nanowire people and their elders past present and emerging welcome to the second of this seminar series um today we've got orianna skyler maestro who is going to give a research seminar before i turn over to orianna please allow me to remind our audience some of whom may be new to the seminar series that the purpose of this seminar series is to showcase the research of women scholars who work on asia pacific security broadly defined i'd like to also remind you that our call for papers and presentations is still open and with a deadline of the 15th of december so if you go to our project seminar series website you will be able to find the details of that we will arrange for the website link to be put up in the chat box in the next few minutes and if you're joining us by the youtube recording the details will be available at the bottom of following the video recording on the youtube channel today's seminar will be chaired by my colleague dr sue thompson from the anu's national security college um before i head over to sue um please just let me um introduce her to you sue a senior lecturer at the national security college which is located in the crawford school of public policy here at the australian national university sue's research specialization is in the history of regional cooperation in southeast asia during the cold war she focuses in that area of specialization specifically on foreign and strategic policy issues in southeast asia um she's also translated some of that um historical work into contemporary implications for regional cooperation in southeast asia um i'm going to hand over to sue and and let her run the rest of this seminar sue over to you thank you very much evelyn and thank you for that um introduction and it's my great pleasure and thank you for inviting me to chair this this session it sounds like it's going to be a really interesting session and i'm looking forward to the presentation very much so it's my pleasure uh right now to kick-start this session with orianna who evelyn has introduced um briefly um prior to me but for those of you who haven't seen the flyer um orianna maestro is a centerfelt fellow at the freeman spaldi institute of international studies at stanford university and she's a foreign and defence policy fellow at the american enterprise institute and the inaugural wilson centre china fellow she's an international security specialist with the research focusing on chinese military and security policy war termination and coercive diplomacy and today's presentation she's going to be talking to us about alliances and i'm actually looking forward to this i i look into alliances a little bit in my historical work but certainly not from a contemporary perspective and it sounds very interesting um what ariana is trying to achieve so i will pass it on to you now thank you and thank you all for for having me uh both in your country i'm calling you from kuji from sydney uh so i am very happy to be here in australia and not be in the united states uh and also have the opportunity to present to you some research in progress i think for these research seminars there's sort of two types of research that scholars present one type is something they've worked on for years you know that they've done and presented so many times they have heard all the feedback they have smart answers to all the feedback and they're just kind of honing their argument here and there the second type is one which i think is more interesting uh but a little a bit more embarrassing to present which is the works in progress where you get feedback when you're stuck you're having issues with certain things and you get to discuss it with with other scholars in the field to help you move forward this project is definitely of the latter type i started working on it a couple months ago and thought uh this would be i would have a quick answer to an easy question and instead have found that the situation is much more complicated than i thought it was and so today i'm going to present to you some of my ideas about alignment and in particular trying to use international relations theory and international security studies to understand what's going on between china and russia so i'll present some of my initial ideas and also some of my current questions and confusions to see if together we can move forward on that so i do have a presentation i think that uh kian is going to share her screen to go through that so i'll just wait um for her to get that started and then we'll just put that in um uh presentation mode and or in slideshow mode perfect all right so uh for those of you who don't know i know rohan since we were princeton together i was a student of tom christensen's and one of i think his greatest works was posing problems without catching up about how the chinese military doesn't have to be a pure competitor of the united states to create issues so i have piggybacked off of that title and have called this discussion posing problems without shacking up which gives you a little hint at what i'm going to say about china-russia relations and east asian security slide so why do we care about china and russia well the biggest reason is that historically it's always been a factor in u.s strategy and the strategy of our allies and partners like australia that it is a serious threat to us if you have a country that is dominating the eurasian landmass and so i have two quotes here one is for the 1988 national security strategy this is sort of the famous quote and one from the 2017 national security strategy the first one says that part of u.s strategy is this conviction that the most basic national security interest would be endangered if a hostile state or group of states were to dominate the eurasian land mass and since 1945 we in this case the united states has sought to prevent the soviet union from capitalizing on its geostrategic advantages to dominate its neighbors in western europe asia and middle east in order to alter the global balance of power in their favor 2017 uh you know a couple decades later we have this assessment on the part of the us government that china and russia are challenging american power influence and interests attempting to erode american security and prosperity so the idea is that china and russia both revisionists powers that prevent that present a challenge to the united states and there's always been this view of what's worse than having one revisionist power is two what's worse than having two is if those two powers came together to coordinate um in order to more efficiently and more effectively challenge the things that we hold dear and it's not only obviously important for the united states i have a quote here as well from the danish institute for international studies that basically says that when the united states threats towards china and russia increase when they reach a certain point a sino-russian alliance could become a harsh reality for the united states in the western order so part of the concern of the 2017 national security strategy was this idea that is the united states creating this coalition by calling out china and russia by putting both of them on the spot making you know potentially enhancing the threat perceptions in both beijing and moscow the united states are we pushing these two together and if so you know is that a problem for um the united states and its allies and partners slide please so being a good political scientist um uh the first thing i sort of always do when i want to answer a question is to go to the sort of the literature you know surely someone has come up with a better answer than i can come up with so i can answer this question for myself which i think has a lot of policy relevance call it a day move on to my next projects um so one thing that is clear is there is a huge debate about how to understand the nature of the relationship between china and russia so from the 2019 uh worldwide threat assessment i have this quote that these two countries are more aligned than they have been at any point since the mid 1950s that they quote seek to shape the international system and regional security dynamics and exert influence over politics and the economies of states in all regions of the world and especially in their backyards so from the u.s government's perspective these countries are coming together but then you go into the political literature and the literature on area studies that look specifically china and russia and you get as i have here a list of what is being described you have some type of alliance political military lines veritable alliance de facto alliance tasks you know tacit alliance some people say sure it's not a full-fledged alliance but it's moving in that direction others say no you know it's not even you know it's rapprochement or non-aggression pact or you know strategic partnership but it's not an alliance so i have read hundreds of reports on china and russia and in the end it seems like there's no consensus on how to understand this relationship slide please in addition to you know how should we understand the relationship there's a a secondary debate on whether or not this matters at all right like are these two countries going to come close together and if so are they going to have any impact they do so there are lists of reasons that scholars give about why they're not going to come close enough to have an impact those are things like historic mistrust military and economic asymmetries different stakes in the international order conflicting positions on seven foreign policy issues and then some say it is the time to worry because these are two autocracies with shared interests that their primary primary goal is to undermine the us-led international order and they have shared threat perceptions and historically that's all you need in an alliance right the soviet union was aligned with the united states you know during world war ii we didn't share a lot of common interests except our need to defeat um you know japan and germany right so maybe that's enough and that pushes them together there is a host of debates some people say no the you know this alignment's gonna be problematic because it's asymmetric china needs russia more others say russia needs china more some people say they're very closely aligned militarily but not aligned in the political economic sphere other people say they're very closely aligned politically and economically but not in the military sphere so in the end there's this broad range of opinions from everything from china and russia hate each other so we shouldn't worry about it to china and russia are basically in a full-fledged alliance uh to counter everything that we hold dear so so this range of the debate to me suggests uh that we haven't honed in on what we are actually trying to study slide please so i gave this a lot of thought and of course uh one of the reasons you do the seminar series is right before like a couple days ago i had what i hope is a breakthrough kind of a breakthrough about how to think about this you know i kept on going back and forth and i and i tried to assess like well some people use these variables other people use those variables like which variables are important which variables aren't important and i just took a step back and asked from you know doing doing policy relevant research which is really something that i focus on why do we care like what is it that we actually want to know and what we actually want to know is china and russia are they forming a countervailing coalition against the united states its allies in the u.s world order we're looking at intentions that's one component the second component is what form is some alignment going to take how deep is it going to be and deep also usually deals with duration as well is it transactional short term or is it enduring what's the scope of the alignment and this is one thing i'll talk about in great detail because i think some of the literature it's either they're aligned or not but all alliances have a scope right even the united states and japan like japan is not planning on defending the united states the scope of the alignment is the defense of japan that doesn't mean the two countries aren't deeply aligned it means that the scope is limited so i think we need to separate those those two those two things out and one of the things i'll talk about a lot today that i have really been thinking about is different types of states align in different ways so a lot of the literature uses the same metrics to measure alignment between china and russia those metrics are derived from understandings basically of u.s alliances with their partners that are more of a patron client type of relationship and so my first question is great power partnerships the alignment between two great powers would it even take the same form as the united states with japan or the united states with australia in which the commitments the defense commitments and the defense resources are are so asymmetric and i come out on the side of of no that we have to weigh different metrics differently depending on which states are involved and i'll talk a bit more about that in the following slides the last question we have here is like even if they have the intention even if we get it right you know what this alignment is going to look like does it even matter do the two sides have the capacity to actually pose any sort of threat to the united states and its allies and here's a quote from john muirsheimer 2014 um that you know he basically says that china and russia are far are still far weaker than the united states and in no position to challenge the united states in any meaningful way so maybe some scholars say you know who cares if these two countries come together they're not going to pose a real real threat so my bottom line review of the literature is it seems like there's this reliance on very high standards very narrow standards and potentially irrelevant evidentiary threshold for what alliance is or what alignment is that may cause us to overlook some substantial efforts that china and russia are undergoing to counter the united states and its allies and partners especially in the context of asia slide please so maybe it's maybe it's my military training but i always like to you know in case anyone's going to zone out for the rest of the talk i'm just going to give you what my argument is before i build through it and the bottom line is china and russia are not going to form a formal military alliance they're not going to fight together in the traditional sense the traditional sense what i mean is the two military is fighting in the same location in some sort of joint way and they seem to be relatively uninterested in coordinating their policies towards third parties so outside of their bilateral relationship of helping each other achieve certain goals in asia they are not expanding the scope of that alliance to coordinate what they do but what is china and russia's policy towards syria for example or towards afghanistan that would be an additional complication this doesn't mean that the relationship isn't problematic hence the title of my talk china russia alignment is deep so it's not superficial it's not transactional it is deep but it's limited in scope and in my view it's basically limited to helping china gain the position of being a hegemon in asia that is the limitation of the scope but of course that is a challenge the international order the u.s light alliance system in asia but i think the scope is relatively limited to asia and even though the two sides are not going to be fighting together anytime soon i think russia is enhancing chinese military capabilities in pivotal ways so one of the things that literature and alignment does a lot is they separate internal and external measures right we know from political scientists they say internal balancing right states can build their own militaries external balancing states can form alignments but in a lot of cases it is external countries that are helping you internally balance right so so separating those two things out isn't very useful and i would say a key part of the alignment is that russia is helping uh china in significant ways in building its military and i also think china and russia might support each other indirectly in a contingency so again you know war fighting is a very complex uh endeavor it isn't just you know two sides you know with bayonets anymore fighting it out there are a lot of supporting and enabling systems that go into warfighting and so i think russia is going to do a number of things that are going to help china whether it is providing them with a strategic rear in which they're providing equipment and other support during a conflict even providing you know satellite coverage intel sharing all this sort of logistics enabling things could help china prevail in a conflict but it makes it very difficult for the united states to control escalation right if we want to impose costs on china and china basically has this safe haven or sanctuary which is russia that they're working from we it's very hard to think about how you undermine their warfighting capabilities without bringing russia into the conflict which might uh you know be very difficult to do so controlling escalation i think becomes much more difficult and even though the two sides are not coordinating towards third parties and i don't think they have any interest in doing so the obvious point here is that competing with two is harder than competing with one so i i think that the united states and its allies will only need to counter one at a time because they do have different interests in different countries around the world but it's still twice the effort because we have sort of two problematic countries we're dealing with slide please so how did i get to some of these conclusions the first thing i did was spend a lot of time reading how other people defined alignment i'm going to present you what i what i have come up with with my definition which is strategic alignment describes the relationship between states in peacetime and in wartime specifically the degree to which they purposefully coordinate security policies to support and protect each other to achieve mutually beneficial strategic objectives there's a lot of different components of this definition i'm happy to go into more in the question and answer but i think some of the most important ones are alignment is something that's done purposefully um a lot of the literature equates alignment with like foreign policy preferences like two countries have the same preferences they are aligned and that's a colloquial way of using alignment but that's not what i'm talking about here i'm talking about sort of the strategic decision to come closer together and and i use mutually beneficial strategic objectives instead of shared interests because i think a lot of times especially with great powers it's they might have completely different interests but they uh one might help one with their interest another might help one with another interest right so as long as it's mutually beneficial um that's what's important and it's in peace time and more time because we can't forget about great power competition right wars are very rare we might never have to fight you know china at all hopefully let alone these two countries together so how do they help each other compete against um other countries in peacetime as well slide please so i come to this definition the next thing to do is to come up with indicators of alignment and what a lot of studies do what you are probably hoping to get from me today is a list of these indicators right things like arm sales joint exercises professional military education how often do they meet what is their total trade what is their total investments like all these indicators and then you know map it on to the china rush relationship to say yeah these are the numbers and then i assign some sort of weight to them and then i come up with some sort of conclusion about alignment the problem is what i mentioned in my argument which is it seems like how states alive depends on the nature of the state but also what their goals are and then the so that then creates the indicators right so obviously if two countries do plan on fighting together we'll look for indicators of you know are they enhancing their ability to do joint operations together the indicator is derived from what the main goal of the alignment is and so in a lot of cases they're not the same there are many reasons i think for example that great power is aligned differently than alignments between sort of patreon client type of relationships that in some cases certain indicators don't mean a lot in patreon client relationships but are very significant between great powers and the other way around so here's just a few examples of some of those the first is great powers can go at it alone right they don't have to do that autonomy versus security you know china doesn't need russia china the definition of a great power is one that can defend and protect itself against other great powers on its own and have a reasonable chance of prevailing that is the definition of a great power so what this means is i think any form of alignment is significant if you're a smaller country the fact that you're choosing to align with another country is not sort of surprising um and so strategically it doesn't have the same significance as a china or russia deciding to align with one another and because there is this less need of security there's less willingness to sacrifice autonomy and so there are certain indicators that we think show alignment like uh do they are they willing to host bases of the other country are they willing to put their forces under the command and control of another country if you're a great power you know china is not going to let russia have a base in china china russia is not going to let china have a base in russia uh the united states and i have a few of the cases and we can talk about that they're very sort of very specific minor situations have us troops been under the command of a non-us commander but these are just you know great powers are not willing to make these types of sacrifices and so a lot of the studies i see we'll take a look at this and say china and russia are not aligned because they you know they don't have bases in each other's countries like are those the right metrics to be understanding what these two countries are doing i would argue uh no also in alignment we're talking about defense and and i have a whole nother paper about revisionism and and how i don't think that's a useful concept uh in general so here i put unfulfilled ambitions listen china and russia rising powers they're not just trying to defend themselves right they have goals that they want to achieve um and so this idea of like a mutual defense treaty is going to be too risky for them right like russia knows like china might have to fight a war over taiwan right like they don't want to be dragged into that that war so because the scope of the potential use of military force is wider for great powers than it is for a smaller country whose main purpose for alignment is just is just self-defense it is you don't want to be so closely entangled because because of the fact that you know that there are going to be issues between countries in the future between great power so a mutual defense treaty whether the two countries have a mutual defense treaty again a non-aggression pact is very significant between grant powers you know mutual defense treaty might be asking um a bit too much uh the the next one i would say is force enhancement comes at a real risk this is just a fancy way of saying when russia tries to build china's military or china tries to help russia build its military this is not costless right when the united states sells some aircraft to india we don't worry that the indian military is going to become more powerful than the united states we don't worry about positional costs like are they going to overtake us or india's direct threat to the united states because there's such a huge difference in power but when great powers help each other build their militaries this is a very risky proposition and so again arms sales between the united states and india might signal a lot people might say yes that's alignment but a low level of alignment but when two great powers are willing to do it that to me signals a higher level of alignment because it is more costly and more risky and because you know these are two great powers they have shared interest they're going to be concerned about distributional gains again because of the power issue if you're strengthening the other side the more shared interests you have maybe the more problems you have so maybe in great power relationships indicator of the best condition for alignment is not how many shared interests they have but how many sort of not shared interests do they have like in many cases people say russia is focused on europe china's focus on asia so they're not going to align but with great powers is this potential the reason why they would align in that their interests do not overlap and so they can help each other uh gain those interests uh without having to worry about distributional gains i would also say that because great power is more capable they have more options for what fighting together means it isn't just this sort of joint under the command like i like i mentioned there's logistical you know equipment other types of support that a great power can offer another great power that can be useful and lastly i will say that alignment between great powers is more risky and therefore more costly and therefore greater signal than between patreon client because it's more likely to spark a great power response right two smaller countries are thinking of aligning we might not be having this sort of research seminar on whether or not they're coming together but at china and russia we focus on that and so it is risky in that case slide please so i started thinking about yes it seems like great powers aligned differently and and in a very informal discussion with my colleagues at stanford one of them mentioned that it seems like what i'm trying to say is that different countries we have to weigh indicators in different ways depending on the country so then i started to think maybe i don't want to just say that great power is aligned differently maybe i want to think about this more broadly and it seemed to me that the more i thought about it the more indicators might be case specific that the degree of power absolute power and relative power and capability between two countries matters when deciding what is an indicator of alignment that the nature of the threat matters because the various contingencies that they're planning for determine strategy right so if we think about should we think more specifically about like how could china how could russia help china in a taiwan contingency then look at peacetime indicators are of are they building the capacity to do that or not would they be sort of contingency specific for example we might see that the ground forces if if china and russia are engaging in military exercises and this goes to my next point about disaggregating variables but all those military exercises are ground exercises you know that doesn't really provide that doesn't really suggest that you know russia is preparing to help china with the taiwan contingency so this brings me to my next sort of point about disaggregating variables separating the wheat from the chaff the question i ask of all the main variables that are used in the literature that then in this project i want to break up into more detail is the following under what conditions are arm sales droid exercises defense engagements etc a sign of alignment and it seems to me that most most of the literature just looks at arm sales exercises and i'm going to give you one example here i'm working on all of these different variables but i'm going to give you one example of arm sales in which i think we need to disaggregate these variables because these are behaviors or activities that most states now engage in if you look at the chinese the recent defense white paper they have a list in the back of all the exercises they do if i you know all the arm sales that occur like this these are sort of common things so the question is when is it assigned and when is it not a sign and just like i mentioned before if we're thinking about being case specific then china and russia engaging in certain types of exercises that are irrelevant to the contingencies that china might be fighting with outside powers then it seems like you know the scope of that alignment is not really of concern to the united states and its allies and partners we have to really look at the details what states are trying to accomplish will determine not only whether they sorry a line that should say but also how uh and in general i'm interested very much in the how slide please so i had so i sort of re-thought this out just a couple of days ago as i was thinking about the why we would care type of thing like what are the impacts and so i'm very interested to see if you find this sort of framework at all useful but i sort of asked myself this question and looked into the literature which i actually did not find as much as i thought i would so any suggestions would be much appreciated how do states help each other achieve foreign policy objectives this is sort of alignment i went back and forth of saying like is it security it's not just military objectives because it's also sort of the foreign building power i want to basically say how do they help each other build and exercise power um and so i'm kind of thinking about different ways to couch this but that's the main question you know what can they do and so i just brainstormed a few ideas and i split them into three different categories things that can be done unilaterally sort of one side gives to the other things that are done bilaterally between the two countries and things that are done with third parties multilaterally on the international stage and this is how i think of the scope of the alignment is it just one side to the other is it the two sides together or is are they aligned in cooperation coordination with all their foreign policies around the world so unilateral the first big thing is sort of force enhancement one side can help build the military of another side this could include training advising building institutional capacity human capital equipping and selling weapons bilaterally you're trying to improve the ability to fight together and i sort of put this in quotes because i part of it of course is fighting jointly fighting simultaneously so i've asked a couple of defense planners um just out of curiosity and and maybe you want to think of your answer to this question as well for those of you that do sort of military operational planning would it be harder to fight china and russia in different theaters at the same time or fight them together in one theater like would we prefer that we have to deal with russia and europe and china in asia at the same time or that china and russia are fighting together uh for armed reunification of taiwan and we're countering them together which is harder militarily and i've gotten kind of a range of answers but the the focus when you look at the indicators is people are always looking looking for jointness um and i guess my point is that that you know might not be how two great powers think about fighting wars it might be simultaneous and lastly you know how can they help each other fight you can do a lot of things together like providing direct logistical support equipment intelshare and use of satellites sanctuary right we talk about sanctuary for terrorists but also can be military bases like you know if china is able to operate from russia were able to get equipment from russia those are going to be targets outside of the reach of the united states as long as russia is not an active believer in that war so one of the reasons i am sort of listing all these things out is and when i go through the example of arm sales what will become clear is when you disaggregate the variables you're going to be looking for certain things over other things right if i'm going to logistical support like intel sharing to me it's more important not to say how many courses does a chinese officer take in russia the question more likely is is there an in-bed is there a liaison are these two countries trying to build their ability to share intel that would be a sign that they are about to help each other versus you know just just sort of taking taking the courses um and the last one is multilateral are they coordinating to support each other's foreign policy objectives around the world this could also include helping to protect each other from outside sources of pressure and coercion so are they coordinating in that way to protect themselves so they're organizing together pressure on someone else they could also divert attention to resources by creating crises this is something i hear a lot um in the policy realm about china and russia the fear that what we're dealing with china russia is going to create some issues for us or vice versa but i haven't been able to find a lot in the academic literature on this of course you have diversionary war theory this idea that governments are trying to divert attention from domestic problems but i don't see a lot of literature on governments trying to divert other countries attention through through external maneuvers so so if anyone has any ideas of that i would greatly appreciate it uh slide please so let me just give you sort of one example of what i'm trying to do here and the first one is taking an indicator that people use for alignment that is arm sales arm sales are a rationally theoretically empirically a sign of alignment because they can improve the military effectiveness of an alliance they add to the warfighting potential of a supplier state they increase the capabilities of the recipient to weaken the security of a common adversary so we see often alliance relationships of which arma sales are our component a lot of the discussion because again it focuses on patron client is about how a country will sell arms in exchange for some sort of political gains bases commitments they might want to submit positive relations with the foreign government things of that sort but looking at arms sales and volume which is basically what people look at is volume of arm sales between two countries as an indicator of alignment is actually not very informative if you don't disaggregate the variable and that's because arm sales are so common uh if you think about every country in the world every country buys something from from somewhere else and also there are both commercial and strategic reasons why states might sell arms so we want to know again if you go back to my previous definition of alignment i want to know you know where the strategic reasons if it's just commercial it's not really a sign of alignment to me uh and so that's not as important and so there's some work being done and i have here jen spindell who has a book coming out that says you know if you sell certain prestige weapons or a certain advance weaponry that is a better indicator of alignment than volume of sales for example slide plays so to the point of arm sales being so common i just have this chart here about sort of the major exporters and importers you know just to give you a sense of the fact that you know just because two countries engage in some sort of arms relationship doesn't necessarily mean that they're that they're coordinating defense policies and ways to help each other achieve um security goals slide please so i have broken up arm sales by the scope and the depth of alignment and for each of these categories i have very long descriptions but i'll sort of go through them and this is what i mean by disaggregating the variables and my hope is and i'll just talk a bit about doing exercises i'm doing this for each so the first one that i call this strategic provision of arm is just you know a state giving another state weapons this is unilateral the next one is bilateral arms arrangements that's that's production arrangements between the two countries and the last is international coordination in this realm of armed sales so the question is where is china and russia on this um on this chart so if you move then across you're getting into i would say deeper and deeper alignment so for example that first if you look at the first line of providing arms first you provide arms to target a common adversary then if you're more aligned you're gonna be providing arms of advanced strategic or sensitive weapons right it to me it's a greater sign of alignment if you're helping a country build a nuclear weapon than if you're providing them with small arms for example and the last is you know the two countries are really aligned if the provision of arms is strengthening one country so much that it negatively impacts the providers relative power right so this way we know it has to be strategic and that they're making a strategic choice to give up their relative power for the sake of enhancing the military of another country and so across this spectrum there's there you're accepting a loss of relative power in exchange for deeper alignment the another reason i think when you go across the spectrum uh you're getting greater alignment is because they demand deeper coordination um so if you go from the bilateral arms arrangements there's different types of production so people focus mainly on do i sell arms to you but there's actually a range of ways that a country can gain those types of equipment selling arms is the unilateral when you move into the bilateral you have things called collaborative production so this is like licensed production and co-production um you know are you allowing the other country to build your arms the next is joint development it's not that they're just building though those arms you are developing the technologies together and then the last one is technical assistance you are helping the other country have their own indigenous capability to build those arms and so there's a lot of research um gilly and gilead have a piece of international security in which they talk about how difficult reverse engineering really is um unless you know you have basically the industrial uh you know know-how and the expertise to develop a certain system well technical assist is that another country is giving you those things right so as you move across this each of those types of arms arrangements require deeper coordination and less control over uh the future military of that country so if you imagine russia selling china something if let's just say they have a falling out russia can stop providing those systems stop providing maintenance updates things like that and those systems over time atrophy and don't become as relevant operationally but if you provide china with the ability to build that system themself then you've lost some of that control right because even if you have a falling out and you stop your you know future assistance they already have the know-how they already have the capabilities so that less control over the future i think also signals greater alignment the last one is international coordination these are ways that i thought of in the arms realm two countries can coordinate the first is mutual embargo protection do we see instances of china protecting russia from arms embargoes and russia are protecting china from arms embargoes the next one is uh primo no no sir which is just to do no harm are they coordinating to not sell weapons to each other's other potential adversaries and then the third is coordinating arms to third parties more generally so do we see either deconfliction or together like if china and russia are both siding with with one group in a civil war that they're both providing arms to that country that they're coordinating their arms sales processes to each other i think that would you know that level of coordination is an indication of deep alignment um in in the international sphere slide please so the unilateral the force development i talked a bit about this when i look at the weapons that are being supplied even within this you know we know arms transfers is something that's focused on a lot we call it security assistance this isn't a form of grant aid this is what arms are just sort of given so at the very least we know there's no commercial reason for this that it has to be strategic so this is often a great sign of alignment but this very really happens between great powers because great powers can't pay for things so just because we don't see arms transfers between china and russia i wouldn't say that that means they're not aligned it's just that those are this is exactly the type of thing that different types of states these indicators mean different types of things um probably when looking at force enhancement we're thinking you know are they getting non-lethal or lethal equipment um advanced strategic and sensitive sectors another reason that's a greater degree of alignment is that it comes often with a discussion of roles missions functions so you are allowing another country to know more about your own strategic thinking and planning and so there has to be a degree of trust for that to happen and some of the sensitive sectors based on the literature things like missile defense nuclear submarines hypersonic technology these are listed as sensitive and on impact i also asked the question do they mitigate a critical vulnerability like what is the degree of alliance oh sorry level of of reliance is it the case that russia is providing china with certain things that it can't create on its own to me you know that shifts the balance of power more so it is a greater sign of alignment than other types of activities slide please and why do we care about you know this is connecting the impact again why do we care with an indicator of alignment the production process if they are engaged in these sort of co-development co-production types of arrangements does this mean that in wartime estate can serve as a strategic rear does that state help with mass mobilization like if if china and russia have co-production does that mean that their industrial basis can both be used in a time of conflict so that china has a greater ability to mobilize than they would be otherwise and a greater ability to sustain war fighting in a protracted conflict so is is russia serving as a long-term is it a reliable supplier in the long term does it seem like they you know halt or call for embargoes as it means to pressure the other country so the deeper the alignment the less likely these types of things are going to be cut off then of course the question and when you're looking at deep alignment is do these arms arrangements change the balance of power in favor of the recipient state because what that suggests again is that that the country is actively strategically choosing alignment and sacrificing relative power in exchange for that slide please and then i talked a bit about the multilateral the broader political uh competition there are costs associated with helping another great power for one they might be competing with each other for arms sales right there already are examples of china taking certain technologies that they've learned from russia and then producing them and then outbidding russia uh in sort of uh in arms sales packages to other countries so you might think about you know how does it affect each other's ability to use arm sales as a tool to influence their third parties um obviously the two sides want to be able to prevent the other from selling weapons to a potential adversary and so there are ways that we could see both sides helping each other's military or their force enhancement through these different types of arms arrangements and so the first thing i did and the slide please is i put together and this is just a snapshot of a very long document of all the systems that russia has sold to china uh and then uh you know what they are what they do uh what is their impact uh in certain contingencies etc etc to try to answer some of these questions that i posed in the chart slide please and this is sort of what i came up with so i think there are there's evidence when you look at the arms relationship between china and russia um of these three that we are in these three different brackets that i have uh circled the the scope does not extend beyond east asia to the international arena it's basically unidirectional we see collaborative production but that's kind of at the lower level of alignment in a bilateral arms relationship but the nature is deep in long long-term because uh there is a negative impact on balance of power that both countries are not going to agree to this type of arrangement if they think there's a possibility you know that tomorrow they're going to be enemies slide please so just to give you some examples within each of these categories you know the first one i said are they targeting a common adversary a lot of these weapon systems and and i can go into more detail in the q a are the main focus is on denying us conventional force advantages in asia it's very clear that the the weapons that the two sides are uh coordinating and cooperating on are specifically designed to counter uh their common adversary which is the united states are there advance indications that they are sharing advanced or strategic technologies yes um you have the anti-air anti-missile defense systems like the s-400 uh you have advanced aircraft ground force equipment which you know you might not think ground force equipment is important in those contingencies but you know china and russia do share a border so at the very least it does suggest that they don't think that they're going to be fighting a border war anytime soon um there is less cooperation uh in hypersonics and anti-submarine warfare than you might suspect so this i think deserves a little bit more research of why is it the case that you don't see russia helping china more in this area um it is very clear that china's military uh part you know partially due to russia's support has become more powerful with respect to russia uh and there's a lot of literature that says that one of the main reasons why after 2016 they restarted arms sales so there was a period in which russia stopped selling arms to china because they were upset about reverse engineering but then they started them up again and one of the main reasons given was the strategic need to counter the united states but also that russia no longer saw china as a threat so one of the things you know if you look at indicators of alignment for great powers in many cases shared interests is less of an indicator to me than uh because they're going to have conflicting interests they're great powers they have so many interests so the question is do they work actively to mitigate their conflicting interests and so trying to reduce the threat between the two sides or mitigate some of the conflicting interests those attempts to be more informative than how many shared interests they have there have been some mentions about joint development under discussion i did not circle that bracket because this is sort of potential um a former ambassador fought mentioned that there had been discussions about joint development projects between the two sides putin recently mentioned that the two sides will launch a joint development of a possible early warning system but right now i don't see um evidence that they are that they have moved away from just collaborative production into the joint development stage and there is a sort of a mutual dependency uh on both sides china accounts for 20 of russia's weapon exports at times in some years has been high as 50 percent and china relies on russia because it can't get advanced weaponry in a lot of other places after the uh embargoes in tiananmen side please so some of my conclusions just from arms sales the first is that russia greatly enhances china's military capabilities if you focus on the prc's principle capabilities and technologies there russia is helping them in significant ways to deny us conventional force advantages in airspace in the maritime domain the arms sales that have been sort of completed are very pivotal the main exports from 2014 to 2019 were air defense systems combat aircraft these are these are areas where china has had difficulty building their own system so if it wasn't for russian intervention and help that they wouldn't have these these capabilities at all that are so critical to the contingencies that they're planning for so i'll just give some examples here like the s 400 can essentially guarantee i know flies out over taiwan or the senkaku islands uh s35 other multirole fighters are totally necessary for air dominance and you know a lot of the comparisons i just have one here between the j-20 and the su-57 some of the russian fighters and the chinese fighters you might think oh they both have fifth generation fighters they both have fourth generation fighters but actually the russian ones are still significantly better because of engine design um and they're more maneuverable which becomes increasingly important if you're engaged in dog fighting for example slide please my conclusions about bilateral and again these are all just preliminary based on the arm sales the overall project is hoping to disaggregate a number of variables in this similar way but it doesn't seem like there's any indication that they're moving towards jointness in terms of systems so it's not the case that they're trying to use they're at the stage where their weapons and equipment are similar enough to really facilitate coalition warfare i like the communication between them sure china has you know a couple you know has some combat aircraft of russia but it's not the case that their militaries can easily communicate with one another so it seems like jointness and the ability to fight together is not a main priority of these arms but a lot of what i've pointed out is just that there's other ways that um that this sort of alignment between the two sides can cause issues one russia is a reliable source of technology weapons and equipment for china even during a conflict and this minimizes the us abilities to coerce china or to deter china through denial um it hurts any u.s attempts to deny tech transfer that improves the lethality of the pla because even if you know we the united states tried to you know prevent boeing from you know engaging in some sort of agreement with a chinese company because of civil military fusion there's always the russians that are there that are willing to provide those technologies to china also it seems like the more they move towards those uh arms arrangements and they're at very nascent stages now it's possible that russia can be an alternative center of production that's less vulnerable to attack for china so they can provide each other with a strategic rear that save for attack um a safe from attack as escalation risk to attacking a country that's not technically in the fight is too high for the united states and its allies and russia can potentially enlarge mobilization capacity in the event of a large-scale war for china which would be problematic and a lot of the contingencies we're thinking of slide please on the multilateral i'll just say i don't see any indications that china and russia are coordinating their arms sales policies either in multilateral fora or to third parties i am still looking into whether they protect each other from arms embargoes but but it doesn't seem like they're very proactively doing that this is important um because you know one of the things is that the two like russia here i sell still sells military equipment to vietnam and india which china will potentially need to fight that's why i didn't circle the you know do no harm uh they haven't coordinated their policies enough such that they aren't selling to each other's potential adversaries um if you look at their arms sales china and russia only share five countries of which they are the main suppliers um and only uh you know the only two countries that share algeria as one of their top three main clients what this suggests is that they aren't really coordinating their arm sales policies at this point and so when we think about like what are china and russia doing in terms of their the scope of their alignment uh some people might point out and say although they're not doing this at international states they're not aligned but i don't think that's very useful i would say yes they are aligned to achieve aims in asia but the alignment scope has not extended um to their foreign policies more broadly slide please uh just to give you a little hint of what i'm thinking about since i want to take q a now you know then we get into force employment that was mainly about force development for you know how how you help another country build the military now what are ways that that russia china can help each other's militaries perform better it seems we have to disaggregate joint exercises the timing scenarios tactics practice whether it's bilateral multilateral where it takes place the units involved all that seems to suggest different things about alignment as well as the types of joint operations do they have access to each other's countries are they engaged in intel cooperation do they have in-beds consultation logistics support all these sort of things again i would disaggregate exercises and then try to measure where china and russia are on this skill in terms of scope and depth uh slide please so it's it seems that if i'm looking at the ways that these two countries are cooperating to maximize the benefits to crude from using their militaries together or separately in p7 wartime uh they russia and china are helping each other improve their tactical and operational capabilities to conduct unilateral operations so what that means is they're helping each other have greater abilities to fight by themselves not necessarily together um we have to look in the exercises in particular and i'm still doing this on you know it's not so much are they fighting together what i'm interested in if you look at this more broadly disaggregate the variables are are they instituted and improving communication channels that facilitate some of the logistical support and enabling mechanisms that i've laid out um and if if they're going to allow access to each other's territories we'd see exercises within the territory so it's actually more meaningful and i've talked to some military planners about this but it's more meaningful for russia to invite china to one of their own exercises within russia than it would be for the two of them to exercise you know with south africa for example because you're inviting another country in to have insight into your own strategic plan in your own thinking and to operate um on your own soil so it seems like that is a greater um thing a greater measure of alignment side please so it looks like this one's a little bit off the off the page the top line this is just a rehashing of what i've said before the china and russia are unlikely to form this formal military alliance or fight together in their traditional sense or coordinate their policies towards third parties but in some significant ways the alignment is deep though it's limited in scope i think right now to the region and you know russia right now is aiding at china's rise which makes it more challenging for the united states to compete with china which i think is the is the bottom line issue here and then my last slide uh on some concluding thoughts so just to leave you with where i am i'm thinking about this there seems to be some redundancy i go back and forth about the depth of the alignment the scope of the alignment and the impact right because they're all related in some way so i've i've you know obviously as most scholars have written this paper in so many different ways in which i start with scope and depth and then say what is the impact or in this case i say how can states actually impact things and then i try to get the indicators from that but trying to discuss those various things um is is difficult um the second point about you know military defense ends and or means is the focus so in some cases you can think about china and russia trying to help each other achieve defensive military ends with economic tools so in that case should i include economic measures a lot of scholars have convincingly argued that economic measures are not a good uh indicator of alignment uh because they're mainly commercially driven um so i've sort of left them out so far but i'd be interested in people's thoughts and the last question oh looks like our slide has changed back oh uh one slide forward yeah perfect um have i missed some ways that states can help each other you know when i list the unilateral bilateral multilateral ways that can you know that states can help each other achieve these goals that then i should think about deriving indicators of alignment from that so i will conclude there uh take questions feedback responses and i'm really looking forward to your um your your views thank you again um thanks ariana that was really interesting um very enlightening actually and now we're going to have half an hour for or so for um questions and answers but before we do that we've actually already asked dr ian henry from the strategic and defense studies center who is um his research specialisation is in alliances and dr henry is going to give us kick-start the discussion uh with a few thoughts of his own thanks ian thanks sue orianna this was a a tour de force uh and a very impressive paper if you can keep it as a paper and not as a book i'll be extremely impressed because it seems to me here that this would actually be a perfect sort of 100 000 word project i think there's a lot of stuff to dig into and um and i wonder to whether the the theoretical contribution this is obviously going to make might be expanded if other case studies were looked at as well um but i'll i'll also email you some comments so i'll try and keep these fairly brief to give other people a chance to chime in as well um on the the theoretical point i think that one of the main um there are two different ways at which this idea of alignment could be approached and that's through the the more narrow alignment literature or it could be through the broader alliance literature and some of this i think gets a key question which i've written down is are alignments subset of alliances or are alliances subsets a subset of alignments and i think here that the differing schools within these literatures will actually have different views on it i mean snyder quite clearly says that alliances are a subset of alignments and then goes on to talk about them in that way so i think um and it's not a flaw but it's something that i think might um sort of cause a visceral reaction among some people who approach it from the alliance literature is to look at how you theorize this idea of alignment and think well where's the other stuff that contextualizes it with view to alliances um you know you do a lot of great work on teasing out what the you know what lemon cooper or what coral saw and what other um more alignment focused uh work say on it but then there's kind of like the other end of the definition where it seems to me that the way you define alignment creeps very close and indeed i would probably say crosses over into how a whole bunch of other scholars actually define an alliance itself and so i think kind of in again putting my own old military hat on getting the left and the right of arc on that definition are really important and sort of you know defining it on one end and then also defining it on the other um all that said i think you're right i think that there is something here that the existing categorizations don't necessarily capture and it's very hard when dealing with this kind of thing because very often we want to amend an existing term or word or repurpose it for our own purposes but it makes me wonder whether actually there would be value in at least thinking about whether what you're talking about as an alignment is it like an alliance theorist i think would probably call it an informal alliance or perhaps even a limited liability alliance there are you know sufficient conversion interests to encourage and prompt a variety of conscious deliberate cooperation on certain security measures particularly those ideas of capability that you've talked about but they are not so convergent as to warrant the the kind of commitment that a mutual defense treaty sends in today's context um and on that note as well i think there's something here about where our modern conception of alliances particularly post world war ii in asia may not actually be all that helpful for understanding the dynamics that are occurring today and it may be more useful to go sort of back and look at those alliance classics that look at uh great power alliances in multipolar uh environments so particularly that pre-war one world war ii stuff in europe the sense i get is that your conception of alignment this is how i would describe it is is kind of is it in my state's interest for this other state with whom i'm aligned to be strong powerful and possessing some independent military weight and my reasons for doing so might be because they could be a wartime ally in the future or simply because i don't want them to be conquered or defeated in battle because that would pose adverse consequences for my security and in the paper you talk a little bit about how this alignment alignments don't involve shared interest in the same way that alliances do to me that interest as i've just described it is actually a really important shared interest but again it's not that kind of we i think we associate the mutual defense treaties with broad ranging we see the world 99 the same way and will cooperate on all manner of things i i definitely agree with you agree with you that there's something below that that the the current categorizations in the literature don't adequately get at um and to my mind it reminded me of glenn snyder's concept of the alliance halo where there are all these elements of cooperation that exist between two allies that aren't actually part of the treaty and uh ancillary to it and probably because of the regular cooperation that's conducted under the treaty particularly that do no harm principle that you talked about in your table i'm pretty sure that snyder himself talks about that as being part of the alliance halo so it struck me as an area that might have some useful stuff to say about uh how to define this this idea i just got two quick comments on the stuff that you've presented today uh your innovations on how to measure alignment i think are a real step forward uh and as you started to talk about those that was when i began to think how on earth is this going to be a paper and not a book so they were really interesting and i think i agreed with you on most of those and it raised for me the question of um you know you could draw some comparisons quite um know some quite interesting ones between the kind of the closest alliance that's probably existed on some of those measures which i would probably say would be the the bilateral relationship between the us and the uk particularly how the u.s helped them with nuclear weapons and um delivery systems uh but i also thought that was a little bit of a challenge to some of your ideas about great powers military bases all those kinds of things um and finally uh on the idea of the the russia china relationship today i agreed with with uh i think almost everything that you said but just one thing that occurred to me i thought i'd draw your attention to uh lol goldstein very recently uh was looking at some work done by a russian scholar and essentially saying that there were these speculations that perhaps in some contingencies russia would open up arctic ports to chinese ssbns and it struck me as a really interesting kind of thing that might be a it may not be a present data point for your argument but it could be the kind of future thing you know where alignments in a crisis scenario obviously here russia's uh interest in not seeing any conflict between china and the us escalating to the nuclear level you might see really limited forms of military basing that could quite decisively affect u.s war planning particularly in a uh in a taiwan scenario that's all i'll say for now because i want to give other people lots of time but again great paper i really enjoyed it and you'll talk today thanks thank you ian um ariana did you want to make any comments of that or because i have another question i can go to yeah i'll just say ian thank you for those comments and i'll definitely uh be bothering you again about a lot of this you know when you say that it might be a book i just have to sort of i laughed for myself because actually this project started out of a question i got in my military job of which they were like can you just give us one slide so so so i'm i still i still owe them that one slide they're probably like why have you been working on this for months and you haven't come up with an answer yet uh but i kind of had that same feeling of like there's just so much going on here and and and arm sales was gonna be like you know a paragraph and now i have like 40 written pages about arm sales so so once i get the framework where i uh maybe a book is definitely a direction to go so i appreciate all those comments and i'll probably just take a lot of feedback and i might not have anything sort of smart to say in response at this time but i'm really looking forward to hearing people's questions okay thank you well we do have some questions um next person um is evelyn evelyn go has the question thanks thanks sue um uh arianna again congratulations i think that this is a a great project and um i think you've done huge amounts already um as you said um two sort of comments and suggestions i think i've got um following on from what ian has already offered i mean the thing that from your presentation that more than from the paper i think that really struck me as the potential contribution here to the literature is that you know for a long time now the alliances stroke alignments literature has you know been obsessed with the one case of you know u.s alliances right which means that they factor we've really only been talking about asymmetrical alliances and of course there's an oldest it's in all the literature on you know alliances that we might and alignments that we might think of as being more symmetrical um and and so i see you know your work as a corrective to that slant in the literature and i take on board everything you said about the quality of great power to great power alignment being actually rather different than what is assumed in the large section of that asymmetrical alignment literature so i'd really push that um and encourage you to think about first of all giving a proper label to your framework which you know i would think of as yeah a framework you know as a great power strategic alignment framework i think that's what you are sort of putting forward in um in what you presented then that slide that had the you know details of it um and to be quite sort of upfront about that because i think that's that's where you are entering the literature um and my other piece of sort of answer to you one of the questions you asked is that if i were you i would actually focus quite starkly on the milit what i think of as the military defense elements of what you've done here because to me that's where the very clear contribution is in terms of material that you have in terms of the analysis that you've already started to do um one day i see in in how you've cast it at the moment is for example when you you have that slide about sort of how states help each other achieve foreign policy objectives in general right i think foreign policy objectives in general is a bit of a dangerous ground to god because it covers all men of sins um i would probably advise thinking about being quite focused on strategic policy perhaps as a label or even military strategic policy to reflect where your comparative advantage and the material you've got is and then to really sort of hone in on that the danger of the way you've kind of put it forward as foreign policy objectives more generally is to my mind when i saw that slide i thought you were trying to do some new work on bringing together the alliance's literature with that international cooperation literature you know how do states help each other foreign policy objectives suggest that oh my goodness there's going to be cooperation stuff coming in here you know which i kind of realized as you went on was not your aim yeah i i took one class with like helen milner that cooperation and that was yeah it's just too broad a scope i think so i'd suggest that my other suggestion i'll stop here is that of course the china-russia relationship you know has you know a bit of a history even in the more modern context and so it just made me think i may be sue too that you know there's that cold war um there's lots of cold war data points for that kind of broad-based strategic alignment you're talking about between china and russia too they did a lot of this stuff uh in that period so you know if you were going to sort of look at ian suggested looking at a number of different cases but even within the china-russia relationship i think there are different temporal points that you could actually um do do some comparative work on if that's where you wanted to go thank you sorry for taking up so much time that's fine and actually interesting you point that out with the cold war relationship between them evelyn when um orianna started her presentation it sent me back to the document national security council document 48-2 which was released in 1950 on us objectives towards um asia and they specifically point out that their role is to divide the soviet union and the people's republic of china um and then it come came full circle at the end of the cold war when the united states then tried to mend the the sino-soviet split by bringing um deng xiaoping and gorbachev together so it's quite interesting but anyway ariana did you want to respond to that no i think those are all great points and on the different cases i will say that i started researching um u.s china alignment in the 70s and 80s and as a china specialist i find i was just surprised with how i i absolutely knew nothing about any of that and a lot of the dynamics that i'm talking about now were present there you know the united states asking for listening station within china and china saying sure but only if it's you know only if it's chinese who are doing it so i think the historical cases would be very useful um it's nice to learn about new things yeah sharing of intelligence data from for the satellites of crises and so on and so forth yeah there's quite a lot there um okay we have a question from um hunter marston he's got his hands up um hi orianna thank you so much for a fascinating uh presentation um i'm glad you noted uh the provision of arms uh to vietnam and india on russia's part and i'm wondering how much does this complicate um the tidiness of your theoretical direction you know it seems to me that uh it's not just the provision of arms and the strategic partnerships that um russia maintains with vietnam and india but also you know i'm sure you're aware that uh rosneft russia's state-owned oil corporation does work in the south china sea uh which is really a point of friction for china and this seems like a rather awkward um interaction that the two aligned great powers have um so i wonder how much does this sort of pull in the other direction of preventing deeper alignment and is there um perhaps you'll be able to explain this away by saying you know i think alliance coordination is tighter perhaps and line mint means that uh there's possibly more flexibility or maneuverability and frictions in these relationships more nuance um thanks i look forward to hearing your thoughts yeah thank you for that hunter and it's good to see you i mean this is something that i have struggled with because for example i have put together like all the statements that russia has made about the south china sea and then everything that china like either has officially said all the chinese writings about crimea and like ukraine and one of the things that's brought up a lot is that like neither side is particularly supportive of the other so this goes back to the question of like with great powers would you expect them to be very supportive or is it enough that they're neutral um so so i don't have a good answer for you i think but part of the question is you know can they compartmentalize these sorts of things because one of the things i noticed looking at the historical cases that i found interesting is when the united states and china were aligned the united states continued to sell arms to taiwan but china never never brought it up publicly right so so during their alignment it's not that they resolved those issues it is how did they deal with the conflicting issues did they did they try to like mitigate it so it wouldn't affect the alignment or did they solve it so so that's what i'm i'm currently struggling with that in sort of the great power alignment because i think great powers you know by definition have so many interests so they have conflicting interests like naturally so are they going to divide up spheres of influence or you know are they going to sort of accommodate each other or are they just going to like close you know say oh let's just pretend that never happened so so i'm not really sure at this point how to deal with those um but i do know that the current literature basically says because they they don't fully support each other or have these conflicting interests they can never be aligned and i and i don't think that's true but i haven't come up with a good alternative yet thanks yeah i think it certainly makes it a very interesting story um you know not something to just ignore um amy the next person with the hand up um thanks ariana i really really enjoyed the paper um i also had the benefit of reading your draft conceptual paper um and both from that and the presentation i two things that really um i thought were quite useful in the definition you're advancing in the approach you're taking uh first the the distinction you're making between shared interests and mutually beneficial uh ways of achieving the objectives i think you're quite right that actually shared interests isn't all that analytically helpful to you uh and i like the direction that you're taking there for um and the sort of the north korea south korea japan case study that you sort of refer to in the in the paper illustrates that nicely but i think more generally uh mutual objectives makes um mutually beneficial um the ways of achieving objectives make sense there um i also was very much persuaded i think that starting with the objectives of the alliance and using that to derive the indicators uh is the is the right way around rather than just collecting up a whole host of indicators um so that was that was very persuasive to me and i think that's a real contribution that you can make and what disaggregates you from so much of the sort of a policy um commentary sort of work on the china-russia relationship which sort of starts from let's just observe what's been happening for the last year or two so that was good but i guess the the one um thing i kept coming back to in thinking about what is the key objective of this alignment between china and russia i accept of course that the united states is a is a feature in all of this and you know uh the external other and the unite the role of the united states there is key but for me equally important to driving the china-russia alignment is the need to re to remove the source of threat in that bilateral relationship you know i know much less about the russia side of course but from the chinese perspective you know achieving great power dominance in east asia requires you not to have an adversarial relationship in russia and that that adversarial relationship with russia you know has been the dominant uh characteristic of the china-russia relationship for centuries you know it's it's a it's a mere blip in kind of the 50s and 60s when they actually were aligned and perhaps again today um and you know the united states certainly serves as an important motivating factor so perhaps driving that align but i think there's a deeper um motivating factor there which you know russia has had long-standing ambitions in the far east uh if if russia really wanted to exert greater dominance in east asia then it would pose great problems for china so i think sort of thinking about the internal dynamics of that bilateral relationship separate from the external other in the role of the united states is important there and i know that in your own definition of alignment um you you don't put the kind of external balancing or defense against a third party in your definition which i think is really useful as a result so it leaves open the possibilities that and you know as you refer to i think of it in your presentation that they may simply be aligning because they're trying to reduce uh or mitigate the conflicting interests or threat within that uh bilateral relationship itself thank you though great great presentation um thanks amy um and i have a comment uh another hand up here is from um rowan yes hi hi arena great to see you uh thank you evelyn and sue for inviting me to this event it was fantastic i really enjoyed the presentation um my question is a little bit so um i think at an intuitive level it makes sense that russia and china are trying to align or would be aligned um i i'm i'm focused a little bit more on the sort of measurement side of things and so to me you mentioned intentions which are clearly an important piece of all of this and i'm wondering if arms sales might be too noisy a measure of that um you know what what especially if you sort of disaggregate the state because your sort of framework takes the state as a unitary actor at least it seems like it does and what happens to intentions we need to segregate the state and i guess what i'm what i'm asking is how much of this is driven by state-level strategic intentions and how much by the economic imperatives and political economy of defense manufacturing right so arm sales are often shaped by the incentives of private manufacturers um both you know towards selling arms but also refraining from arms for ipr concerns you know intellectual property concerns and not necessarily shaped by the willingness to lose relative power so russia sells similar levels and types of equipment to india as it does to china like the s-400 uh but does that make india aligned with russia and if that if that's true then is india aligned with both the us and russia that work so arm sales as a measure itself seems to be a bit difficult to sort of reverse engineer intentions out of um and and i'd be curious to hear your views on how it fits into sort of your other metrics and whether we can say more about yeah its role in that thank you i'll just make a quick comment to both amy and rohan um you guys both have asked questions that pinpoint two issues of two other projects that i have uh one is on how to decipher and measure intentions which i have like a 50 page paper presented at notre dame right before the shutdown that i'm still like struggling struggling with and then how do we understand competition so amy to your point about like you know trying to reduce their threat to each other that's absolutely the case i have this whole other project in which i'm trying to understand how states compete in like the peacetime environment and that you know that is a key component is is making sure you don't have to deal with the threat of another country and so this is i think you know the arm sales for example that s 400 i guess what i was trying to say is exactly that because india is different than china the s 400 might not be a sign of alignment with india but is a sign of alignment with china given that given that india and russia are not going to be fighting wars against each other given that they're not like potential adversaries the way that russia and china are especially in terms of you know the history of their sort of nuclear relationship so the fact that russia was willing to do that now now you bring up the point of the incentives of private manufacturers and that's why i try to break it down a bit to like as i say like you know you have these pooling equilibrium in which you know a state's going to sell whether they're aligned or not aligned so other certain indicators that can tell us they would only do this if they were actually more aligned or to amy's point at the very least you know russia has decided that you know china is no longer a threat to them in the near term um as you know they just stopped their sales or their their um transfer from s 400s to china recently so i don't know what that means uh but but that's kind of what i'm trying to get at is this issue of the indicators does it mean something different based on the countries that are involved and my hunch is yes um uh but i haven't come up with like a maybe you know a broad enough or maybe narrow enough framework to help us address some of those issues so um i agree with all those all those points that were made there's definitely things that i'm thinking very deeply about but i haven't been able to straighten out completely in my own mind yet okay and we had a question here in the chat there was one here from um bill uh who talks about the question of dividing china and russia with in terms of war and then uniting them in terms of peace um and did you want to make a comment about whether you see anything like that or we can take that as a comment well i'll just say one of the big questions of why this matters is i'm trying to figure out like is it worth our effort to try to divide these countries and if it was like how should we go about doing it i think before we can answer those questions we have to understand what the nature of the relationship is and the impact that it has on the region um but i'm definitely you know partially driven by those questions to try to come up with with a good answer in the end and then of course my advisor tom christiansen wrote a whole book about how actually if the two if two countries like china and russia are divided and competing against each other it actually creates more problems in the international system than if they were united so that's probably you know something that i'll have to deal with once i come up with answers to the former questions so if i may yeah just um before we we all go off um i'm just going to post in the chat box for everybody the link to the seminar website where orianna has also provided a number of such a small number of suggested readings that relate to this topic so if you're interested in that please have a look just follow the link that is now in the chat box thanks sue thank you and i'm just going to post um quickly my email to people for those of you that didn't enter early and just didn't hear us chatting you know i am calling from sydney and i am in australia somewhat indefinitely at least until august um and so hopefully at some point you know we can continue these exchanges of course remotely but you know we do plan on coming to canberra uh sometime in the new year and so it would be very useful you know if you're interested in connecting and continuing this conversation other conversations uh further in person you know please send me uh please send me a note thank you ariana and in fact that is really good as also the reading list because this is a topic that has lots lots that one can unpack from um and even just from my perspective as a historian there's a lot to unpack from the history or the post-war history of the soviet china relationship as well even to understand that you know let alone looking into the contemporary period um but thank you very much for that presentation and also thank you everybody who made a comment um it was a very very thoughtful and insightful um session
pMkuA9IVchk,The Taiwan Choice: Showdown in Asia - Australian Foreign Affairs issue launch,"If Asia’s key flashpoint erupts, what will Australia do? The decision could reshape our future in Asia.

“If America goes to war with China over Taiwan, Washington will expect Australia to fully commit to the fight. This would pose one of the hardest strategic choices any Australian government has ever faced.”

– Emeritus Professor Hugh White AO

The latest issue of Australian Foreign Affairs, The Taiwan Choice, examines the rising tensions over the future of Taiwan as China’s pursuit of ‘unification’ pits it against the United States and US allies such as Australia.

Hugh White, Linda Jakobson, Brendan Taylor, Jade Guan, and I-Chung LAI discuss Xi Jinping’s intentions, what a conflict might look like, and what Canberra can do to both soothe tensions and prepare for a confrontation.

The Taiwan Choice looks at the growing risk of a catastrophic war and the outlook for Australia as it faces strategic choices that could reshape its future in Asia.

at the aiu he's a multiple contributor to afa his essay in this issue argues that taiwan cannot be defended by the us and that this has major consequences both for asia and for the us australia alliance um next we have jade wan jay he's a lecturer in strategic studies at beacon university and an expert on chinese foreign policy and history and international politics of east asia she's

the team for um for all your support and for making this happen tonight thanks michelle and um uh um thanks again uh for coming it's great to be back here again after a long break thanks thanks [Music] can you hear me up the back is that clear all right i'm going to try and project um thanks so much for coming to what i hope will be a really engaging uh and interesting discussion with some absolute first-class minds taking a look at one of the most important and difficult foreign policy questions confronting the globe um what i'm going to do is i'm not going to try and do a sort of full reprise of everything but i'm conscious that not everyone in the room has necessarily read the full afa yet so what i might do is i might offer or start off just with a question to all of our panelists in particular those starting with those who have essays in this afa just asking them to draw out some of the key themes and and points uh that they've made and so look i'll get straight to it and go straight to hugh um right at the other end now i've pulled out one quote here um hugh and i know it's it's just one but i i figure it's the one that gets to the heart of the the point that you're making and it's this quote america's promise to defend taiwan is no longer strategically or militarily credible and maintaining it does more harm than good and further you go on to say that australia should recognize this and quote make it clear to washington and taipei publicly and privately that it does not support such promises to defend taiwan and it would not join america in a war over taiwan now can you lay out please hugh why you think that america's promise such as it is within the the framework of strategic ambiguity uh is not credible and why you think that australia should make this declaration to both washington and taipei yeah look thanks steven and thanks jonathan and maury a chance to be here and thank you for coming look one of the real challenges in this business is to establish the correct connection between the broad strategic the grand strategic questions and for that matter the sort of moral and political questions that flow from them including the sense that we have a moral obligation to support a democracy like taiwan on the one hand and the harsh military realities on the other and in the end the harsh military realities are like engineering problems they're just they're just physical facts the fact is that for a very long time until probably a decade ago this the united states superiority in air and maritime capabilities meant that the united states had a very good chance of being able to win a war with china over taiwan and effectively defend taiwan and that's just no longer the case anymore now of course wars are always uncertain they're always surprised vladimir putin's discovered um but you know one's got to make a judgment on the basis of the evidence available and it's very broadly accepted now that china can effectively deny the maritime approaches to taiwan to u.s ships and aircraft it would take a lot of uh hits in a u.s china conflict the china will take a lot of hits but the americans would take a lot of hits too and the americans could not put enough and impose enough pain on china to make the chinese stop so america can't win and what's worse by failing to win a conventional war the risk that it escalates to a nuclear war is very great uh i think much higher than most other most people understand i do think we have to be incredibly careful about the idea of starting conventional water between nuclear powers we have no experience of this but all the evidence the cold war is that once the conventional war gets going a nuclear war is not very far behind so i think we need to be extremely careful about that what that means is that much as we might like to be able to defend taiwan the military reality is we can't and i don't think that's a military reality that can be reversed simply by spending another percent of gdp on defense or whatever go very deep to the deeper features of the operational and technological balance and if that's so then it's a really dumb idea for the united states to base the credibility of its position in asia on its ability to fulfill a promise that i don't believe it can fulfill and what's worse by basing its credibility right it increases the temptation for the united states to go to war over taiwan even if it's not going to win and going and starting a war that you're not going to win is a really dumb idea we anglo don't have much experience of losing wars at least for the last couple of centuries so we tend not to put as much emphasis on this but i think it's a really fundamental question you don't start a we haven't got a reasonable chance to win and in australia's case you don't join and shut the war but you don't have a reasonable chance of which that has very big and very gloomy implications for the future of u.s power in asia very gloomy implications for the future of australia's dependence on u.s power as a foundation for our for the asian order and our place in it but that's why i conclude as you mentioned in that quote that we should discourage the united states from promising this discouraging the united states and fulfilling the promise if comes and recognize what this means for the future order in asia and start adapting to it now all right look i'd really like to come back to quite a few of those uh threads but i'll move on for the moment and we'll revisit some of them linda i might go to you next i'll i've got a quote here um you argue that beijing will use quote all means short of war to take back taiwan there's also the prospect it uses the means of war as well but let's focus on the means short of war at least for now can you describe what you mean by that what sort of tactics are already being used and what tactics are currently being contemplated by the chinese leadership to try and wrestle control of taiwan okay lovely to be here thank you to afa for having me and letting me write that essay um i have two key points before i come to what it's going to look like and they're very brief one is that xi jinping has said clearly that he wants to see reunification in his lifetime he said we cannot we can no longer leave the taiwan issue to future generations and in this is a clear difference from his predecessors so we we can expect movement on the taiwan issue second one is xi jinping doesn't want war he wants to be able to see or oversee reunification as the people in the prc say in a way that doesn't lead to war he wants stability he wants prosperity he is not hankering off the wall and i think that's a point that many of the analysts have got wrong and why then do i say that he will use all means short of war so what are those means they're means such as taking out the communication system taking out the lights stirring up internal domestic clashes within taiwanese society possibly a blockade or a partial blockade now i know we're already on the brink of actions which are considered war actions but all means short of war means to stir up so much chaos within taiwanese society that the political leadership will buckle and say okay we will negotiate because after all they have been told all that the beijing is asking for is to negotiate they aren't saying you have to reunify tomorrow what they're asking for is without preconditions you will come to the table and have political talks about reunification now in the essay in the afa i also besides taking out the lights and putting huge pressure um on taiwanese society i envision possibly a hundred thousand fishermen unarmed going across from fujian province um towards taiwan is a democratic society going to mow down a hundred thousand unarmed fishermen of course most of these fishermen would then be guerrillas who would come on shore and and stir up trouble so i think this constant pressure which will intensify and lead to in the mind of xi to an agreement to start talks is what he aims for now there could be a missile that goes astray kills 20 people i'm not saying there won't be bloodshed um and at any moment during a very intensive campaign like this um we could slip into a war situation by miscalculations misinterpretations and so on so all means short of war could actually lead to war but i think this is what they will in the beginning try and my last point here is that each action that they take it'll be like salami slicing like we've seen in the south china sea no one action will warrant a response from the united states militarily if no one action will bring the whole region up in arms against beijing so they'll be able to bit by bit slice away and and create that turmoil which at the end in cheese eyes will lead to an agreement to talk all right um brendan i might go to you next um because we're coming to the well it's a it's not a cheery read the opening of for those who haven't read the opening uh sections of brendan's piece it deals with the prospect of a hot war in the strait and what that war might look like including the horrible possibility of a nuclear conflict and the cataclysmic results that would flow from that brendan can i get you to lay out just briefly what a hot war might look like in the strait what the consequences of that might be i'll uh i'll read a a brief quote here as well on top of that um after that you talk a lot about given the cataclysmic consequences of a hot or the importance of diplomacy you say australia really needs to put the shoulder to the wheel in terms of regional diplomacy to try and do everything possible to forestall war um you say here that australia is part of that should prioritize trying to quote establishing a high-level diplomatic channel to beijing to influence china's behavior can you expand i know there were other measures you talked about there but can you expand in particular on that suggestion why did you nominate that and why do you think that australia could potentially exert any influence at all on this question given the crushing you know forces of history and geopolitics at play well thanks thanks very much steven if i also add to i think the very last live event that i did was exactly two years ago in melbourne with um with jonathan so jonathan thanks so much for having me back in this lovely day to finally see you again after all this stuff this time i mean i think you know the last two years have been have been pretty difficult um for all of us um the bad news is that if hugh's scenario eventuates and we do end up um with taiwan escalating beyond the you know atom conflict escalating to the nuclear level the bad news is that the last two years will will seem power by comparison that's a sheery thought yes i mean it's not and it's not um you know it's not that unlikely a a prospect um you know i think we won't be talking about things like petrol prices will actually be you know potentially talking about things like you know when they're actually being no no petrol at the bowser um we won't be talking about you know food food prices of you know sorts of issues like um supply chains and those sorts of things would have been magnified um but you know to a very significant degree so i think that you know that's something we certainly want to to evolve um to avoid what what really worries me is that the kind of the scenario that linda sketches that kind of all all measures short of war or kind of um verging on on war to go from that point to what he was is um uh describing i think um in the current age um and unlike the cold war um i think we could escalate from from what linda's describing to what he was describing you know very very quickly because of the different technologies that that are being used um and i'm very happy to go into detail on um on those um but i also think that these are issues that aren't really being sufficiently grasped by either side of politics in australia at the moment on the one hand we have uh peter dutton coming out and saying that you know conflict is um you know it would be inevitable in a case of conflict for australia to decide with the united states on the the other hand we have um you know uh those on the other side of politics such as as penny won saying um you know we really need to do what we can to preserve the status quo i just don't think that either of those positions are are sustainable i think dutton is asking the is posing the wrong the wrong question i think if we get to that point where there is a conflict it's it's going to be a war that nobody wins and it won't really matter particularly if it escalates to the nuclear level and i think that's a you know huge right that's a very likely scenario on the other hand i think that the and linda talks about this in in her wonderful essay i think the status quo that has managed to kind of keep the peace um across the taiwan straits for really since the the period since um uh 1949 onwards is is now unraveling and i think um you know china's assertiveness is a big part of that story but also that the pushback from the us and its allies um and also from uh even from taiwan understandably does heighten the risk of um of conflict and so what my argument in the in the essay is is that um australian leaders should really be doing much more uh making a much more concerted effort um and not necessarily unilaterally and in concert with other powers in in the region um you know japan singapore south korea indonesia other players who would be equally if not more affected by the sort of conflict situation um that we're that we're talking about that um that that really that the um the need for a kind of a diplomatic solution to it to avoid this um this sort of um conflict or at least to reduce the risk of such a conflict i think should be really a priority for australia's leaders right now and how about that idea just caught my notice the idea of a of a hotline or some sort of high-level diplomatic channel between canberra and and beijing why why why do you suggest that yeah well i mean the hotline might not necessarily be between canberra and and beijing but i suppose i'm slightly more optimistic than you is not much more optimistic but slightly more optimistic about where the where the balance of power the correlation of forces between the us um and taiwan and the us allies on the one hand and china is on on the other hand i think that that china still has about another seven or eight years before it reaches a point where i think hugh says that china is at right now where it or it can uh be confident that not only it can prevent the us from intervening to defend taiwan but also where it develops the kind of the the sea lift and other other capacities to be able to be confident that i could um invade um invade taiwan i think during that window there's a much greater chance of a kind of an inadvertent escalation you know as linda says events kind of spiraling out of control but i think there will be quite an important um tipping point at that seven or eight year mark and we kind of get ourselves into into huge scenario and in that window i think that's where things like hotlines where militaries where governments can communicate with one another to avoid uh escalation occurring or um if they're in a crisis situation to and to ensure that or to try and reduce the risk of misperceptions and miscalculations i think that's where those could be valuable so at least for the next seven to eight years i think that in partnership with others in the region this is the sort of thing that australia should be advocating for the use of these nations thanks um jade it might come to you now please there's a slightly ancillary point but a really interesting one you talk about in a low eps you don't of course have a piece in afa but in a really interesting lowy piece you wrote recently you talked about the influence that australia could actually assert in washington in the event of if not a full crisis perhaps in the lead-up to a crisis and i'll just quote briefly saying the precise manner in which canberra could exert its influence over its superpower ally prior to and during a conflict in the taiwan strait now requires more urgent attention i'd really like if it's possible for you to elaborate a little bit on that point what sort of attention should australia pay here what sort of role i mean i presume you'll say australia could potentially play a moderating influence but what sort of role do you believe that australia could or should play in the event of a crisis in terms of its uh relationship with washington thank you thank you everyone um it's really great to be here with first class experts on this i think there are more qualified speakers than myself to uh talk about this here but really a great honor to to be here um i i think that's a really great question um when i wrote that it's really kind of i was disturbed by um um sort of uh um kind of you know the i think it's in the context of the um uh the kobe the inquiry i think australian you know did that unilaterally um and then that that resulted the pushback from the mainland china which i think a lot of commentators already expressed that actually australian government could do a better job to do that with uh you know all the regional statehood stakeholders so when that you know the the uh the drum of war beating that claim uh came up i i thought oh no we shouldn't repeat that kind of uh uh scenario again australia should be you know isolated or australian just do a diploma diplomacy uh unilaterally this is this is the world health organization pro proposed by famously organizations yeah yeah so so i i i think so in that context i i wrote the piece i think i quite agree with uh brandon uh you know argued that in his article i you know i'm a person really favor diplomatic power and multilateralism uh so i think australian uh really should be careful and apply more wisdom on this not just you know walk by itself but it's uh an ally of the united states it can i think a regular um meetings and conversations with its uh counterparts so i think australians should pass its views or its positions concerns um not only as austrian itself but uh because australian sitting a very important strategic predation in the south pacific to you know to bring all those kind of views that has to its allies and make a smart you know choice thank you do we have doctor ly on the line but uh thanks for having me here i think yeah uh probably the topic about it is that the um uh whether uh the china taiwan the kind of warfare uh one would that come and how town can be defended and the likelihood for the chinese youth force against taiwan and those are chinese parliaments toward taiwan um i would have to say that um just let us back a little bit uh just look at the development of the post global chinese partners into taiwan we have three leaders uh zhang zaming and wu jintao and shikim in the meantime there was a 1995 united states talent street crisis in the hujin house time there is no such thing an incident of course since year 2016 uh the uh military uh tension started to rise and uh even right now we saw that the right and uh dramatic but then if you look at those three uh the most successful policy in chinese view toward taiwan and not get the most scared among the taiwan uh chinese government it's actually under the house time that the fujian town was able to lure a lot of the taiwanese not only investments but also the the so for the people about how they feel about china if you do the opinion survey at that time that although the government feel that the uh the chinese government policy uh attitudes over taiwan uh the people sometimes they have the baguette uh in terms of their perception regarding their uh view about chinese people as well as chinese government whether they are very hostile or the less hostile or torah taiwan so uh it is very ironic that in gentilman as well as xi jinping's time that the bose leader has a certain level of the military and harassment uh but it is puting power and under his time that no such things but uh it seems that the the political taiwan at least uh according to many outsiders as far as the analysts in taiwan the who do not seems to be the one that achieved the most uh to be the most successful one and then that uh tells us something that is the um when the chinese uh about the unification of taiwan of course it has been their long-term policy since 1949 but uh the uh there are various uh period of the variance uh intensity method but then i think one of the issues we could actually deduce from those developments is that china if they are very uh rich could the economy try to lure taiwan into unification and that's exactly what the fujinha was doing uh he tried to showcase to the italian people about how rich how wonderful and how successful the china state is so that the uh um the taiwan you could join that there's so much prosperity that you can you can have but and and also there's another issue that's regarding the um um uh the economic opportunities uh in that time fujian health spirit that china actually present to a lot of taiwanese people as the area for a lot of economic success uh the even some of people they believe that economic future of taiwan is actually in china and also in terms of the how the china could uh terrorize our interest emissions uh the uh i think that element did not work well whether that is in gentlemen or in the in the shipping bins and so that's right now the uh increasing level of the military usage against taiwan uh you sort of indicate that first of all china lost the kind of offensive against taiwan that the trump appeal to taiwan that's no longer there and second the kind of economic opportunity in chinese actually and yes they never agree for taiwan it's also also lost its appeal if you look at the ministry of economic affairs in taiwan right now one of the major uh tasks of major business is to help the taiwanese investment and have businessmen to safely get out of china and i would since i was on one of the review board that we just received so many requests from the town businessmen operating in china and asking that what is the best way or the kind of safest way for them to be able to get out of china because right now chinese first of all they are not that welcome entire investment anymore and second the uh uh for using china as area for the exports uh we they started to bunk into all the questions regarding the u.s china the trade war and all those and third if the china has a market and the market only uh worked for the the chinese the indian chinese there rather than for the taiwanese they are trying to sell things in china so that economic appeal is also losing and the way that the sri lanka is using the military forces actually uh demonstrate that the uh china is now um losing all the other method on appeal and also probably losing some of the strength so that they have nothing but using military to terrorists however into submissions right uh dr i'm sorry to interrupt i'm i'm just um i'm just hearing that we were actually struggling to hear you with a few people up the back in particular i'm sorry this is entirely a technical gremlin it's of no fault of yours uh but people out the back i'm told are struggling a little bit to hear you i might if it's okay just get the moderators to see if we can come up with a bit of a fix to get you some better audio and come back to you later in the discussion i apologize for that but you're audible in the first half and not in the back so i'm just conscious that's neither fair to you nor half of our audience so let me let me come back to you and i apologize um can we just briefly uh take a bit of a turn to a slightly um tangential question but one that's obviously really pressing and that is of course the events in ukraine at the moment there's been a lot of talk about how the chinese leadership what lesson how they are watching events in ukraine what lessons they may already be starting to draw from events in ukraine um linda i'd like to come to you on this first and then go to the others what impact do you think events in ukraine at the moment are having on the calculus uh in in china in china's leadership and can you talk a little bit about the parallels that do and don't exist between the situation in ukraine and across the strait well this is something i've been giving a lot of thought to over the last two weeks especially um being in finland where um events in ukraine have been quite traumatic to watch but let's start with the first question there's no doubt of course that xi jinping and other senior leaders of the communist party of china are watching the events in ukraine extremely carefully as is the whole world but obviously with in mind a possible conflict over taiwan and um i think the whole bureaucracy the research world the think tank world is now geared to understanding um what went well from the point of view of russia and what went poorly and and there'll be numerous innumerable uh reports and internal deliberations on about this so there's no doubt that china is watching very carefully what's going on but one of the things i'd like to point out if i come to your second question stephen is what's similar when you think about china wanting to reunify with taiwan and and what's going on at the moment uh between russia and ukraine um and one of the things that it's it's understandable that the world media has been commenting on this but one of the points that is missing which is absolutely fundamental when you start thinking about any comparison between these one event and one possible event is that approximately one week before russia did invade ukraine the president of the united states joe biden came out and says we will not use force we will not send our military in to ukraine we will not defend ukraine that is a huge difference to the calculus going on in beijing when they contemplate either all means short of war knowing that it could spiral into a real war or contemplate a outright invasion attack on china the ambiguity of the united states policy towards taiwan has been the foundation of this triangular relationship ever since 1979 when beijing and washington uh formed diplomatic relations and officially at least turned their backs on taipei so there's going to be no statement in any circumstances i i don't usually say anything this with certainty but there's going not going to be a statement by the united states president that we will not come to the defense of taiwan under any circumstances so it's a completely different calculus from beijing's point of view when they think about it um hugh i might go to you next on this what i mean it's very early days we have no idea what's going to happen we don't have a clear idea of what's going to happen in russia and ukraine over the next few weeks let alone months let alone then extrapolating out to taiwan but are there any lessons or are there any observations you'd like to make at this very early stage oh yes i think there's some very important lessons i completely agree with linda that the most important thing about the ukraine crisis so far is that the united states declared so categorically that it was not going to individual and indeed back in december biden said that right at the beginning of the process um and i think that's terribly significant for chinese calculations because going back to some of the things that brendan had willing to touch on xi jinping doesn't want to fight for taiwan of course he doesn't want to walk in america what he wants is for america to back off and he wants the american back off not just because that gives him taiwan without the cost and expense and data of a war but because in the process he humiliates the united states demonstrates the united states promises to defend people in the western pacific are not reliable and therefore not just undermines america's position in relation to taiwan but undermined america's position in relation to both its allies japan south korea australia and other partners in other words if you want to if you're sitting in zhong nang high in beijing and you want to undermine american strategic leadership in east asia and take its place the best thing you can do is to create a situation in which america has committed itself to do something and then does subjects that's catnip and so to me the really striking thing and so i'm doing the with great history so i'm drawing a diametrically opposite conclusion from linda i think sitting in jung high what the chinese see is that america not sounding course the fact that ukraine is not an ally but then again neither is taiwan america has not been willing to go to war over ukraine for a very simple reason it can't win and although the operational circumstances are different the basic calculation is the same that is the united states cannot project and sustain enough power in the theatre of war to give itself a high level of confidence of being able to prevail and there's a very significant danger of escalating nuclear exchange now that is just exactly what i think is also the case already being a bit gloomier than brendan um in in the theater and so in in the taiwan straits so i think what i fear is that xi jinping looking at the way in which both swords make the point just not just the us but also the rest of nato because the rest of nato said they're not fighting either uh for all the talk about oh you know we must have ukraine and nato release we must have given ukraine the option of being in nato they in the end haven't been prepared to fight for it and the russians have i think that increases the beijing's there's a danger that increases beijing's confidence that when push comes to shove when the chinese impose a blockade for example which i do think is the most likely military scenario when that when the president faces the choice as to whether or not he's going to deploy the seventh fleet to break the chinese blockade and initiated what would what i think would then escalate into a major region of war the president looks down the barrel of that very big gun and says no the the the fact that that biden made their judgment in relation to ukraine by fear will increase confidence that he will make that judgment in relation to taiwan that will encourage him to give it a go and that will then present a u.s president with a truly disastrous choice between either going starting or he can't win or not starting a war stepping back from the conflict having the credibility of america's strategic position in asia very significantly undermined i would say destroyed and the really tragic thing is that whichever choice he makes america's position as a leading power in asia is screwed which is of course exactly what xi jinping wants i'm just i'm really keen to get to questions because i'm conscious that uh with so many speakers we've uh we don't have much time but just one very last one i might go to jaden and brendan on this strategic ambiguity um there's been there have been numerous instances two at least maybe even three where president biden has delivered what could be called gaffes seemingly seemingly ditching the prospect of strategic ambiguity saying at least in one famous town hall that no america does have a commitment to to defend taiwan if it's attacked then subsequently walked back by the white house press secretary it's happened two maybe three times leading to a lot of speculation this is quite deliberate on the part of the administration um and then of course in australia you've also got a situation where peter dutton declares us he's already touched on that it's inconceivable uh that australia wouldn't join with the united states in the defense of taiwan were china to launch an attack and then that was subsequently walked back um over a series of interviews most decisively a couple of weeks ago um i might start with you brendan and then jade after that what do you make of this looseness of language is this just ill discipline is that startling given the states that are that we're looking at here um or should we perhaps read something else into it a deliberate ploy by the americans and perhaps even by by peter dutton even given how marginal we are in all of these equations um to introduce just inject a little bit more uncertainty into beijing's mind yeah i think i think that's right on your last point um steven and i think what what your question really hones in on is is you know obviously the the kind of the main kind of fundamental driver of tensions over taiwan is kind of china's growing assertiveness that that we've seen you know over the uh really as as linda points out really since cj ping became leader of china and kind of had this kind of you know spit change in terms of um you know saying that this issue can't be passed from from generation to to generation and we've seen kind of chinese coercion of taiwan really increase during that time i think that's well understood that's kind of well documented i think what isn't as well documented or is acknowledged it's kind of um uh that there are things that the that the us is doing that's um that's also exacerbating this tension and challenging the status quo so even though officially the us has said that his position hasn't changed it remains that kind of traditional position of of not guaranteeing that it would come to tolerance defense but at the same time i'm not saying that it wouldn't that kind of the essence of strategic ambiguity i think that if you look at what's happened really starting in the trump administration um you know right back to those early days when trump was elected and he took a phone call from from president sang when congratulating him on being elected um through to the you know the record levels of arms that um the 18 billion dollars worth of arms that trump had um trump approved for for sale to to taiwan right to those dying days of the the trump administration when the secretary of state mike pompeo relaxed kind of diplomatic restrictions that have been in place um which got buried he's been in retrospect yeah consequences partly because the us capital building was being stormed at that really taken me by surprise um is the extent to which that trajectory has continued on into the biden administration to be honest i it's very rare for an academic to ever say that they were wrong but i think that in this situation i expected a degree of moderation or pulling back from the biden administration but if anything we've seen that that position can continue and i think that that that kind of doubling down that kind of attempt to strengthen deterrence um i think it will it will be sustainable for you know maybe another seven to eight years i think after that point as the kind of the military balance really starts to shift you know if used right it's already shifted if i'm right it'll start to really tilt significantly around about that point i think at that point those those us guarantees uh that that kind of more uh clear position at the u.s china stakeout becomes less and less credible and i think that's one of the reasons why you're seeing uh us leaders and officials really double down now because they realize that window is is closing and um and will have closed and you know by the end of the decade yeah jay any thoughts of you on that question before we got a question yeah thank you i just do two thoughts the first one is on the strategic ambition i think that have been played by all the three governments prc garments the town government and the united states uh so i think the street it seems very odd i think the three governments have been playing or have emphasized how important about the verbal formulation from the start of the 1972 the first china u.s communicate to you know the uh 82 the shanghai community but equally i think taiwanese played that as well what does independence mean i think it goes back and of course in the centurion's time they have a referendum but then that's taiwanese independence in the name of taiwan and then i think now time one plays that a more problem uh programmatically it's actually i think a pursuit uh de facto independence so but they never i think it's clear what his independence really mean and what is really wang china me so i think these are played by three garments the second point i would like to make is i think yeah um in terms of the military or the jet flights of this so-called taiwan's air id identification zone it is true china uh the prc has increased the numbers the frequencies but i think that regarding beijing's position on taiwan it hasn't you know never as non-observative from the 1550s you know to taiwan crisis to 90's the third town crisis to 2005 the anti-succession rule they are i think they are all very assertive of behavior um so i think that's very consistent and we should i think consider china's position really seriously it takes that as a core national interest it's a as i think as the audience are familiar with chinese official document it's an internal issue so i think when i said we should possibly like multilateralism in diplomatic power but on the other hand we also should be careful not to project you know we try to internationalize this issue to accumulate beijing i think that's a very hard tight rope we are working on this matter all right look can you please join me in thanking our wonderful panel [Applause] [Music] also thank you so much to the afa maury schwartz uh jonathan pullman and others for hosting this and also for uh for your sterling work with afa which is a wonderful publication which we're all delighted to contribute to

64VmOH9wYTc,Not your parents' Cold War: Why this time is different and more dangerous - Hugh White AO,"It is only natural that we see the ‘new Cold War’ through the lens of the old one. But how far is the new Cold War against China like the old one against the Soviet Union?

Today’s policies in Washington, Canberra and elsewhere are based on specific views of both the similarities and differences - views that underpin the prevailing optimism about how the contest will play out, and who will win.

In this lecture, Hugh will offer a different view of the similarities and differences which suggest that optimism about this new Cold War is misplaced.

Hugh White AO is Emeritus Professor of Strategic Studies in the School’s Strategic and Defence Studies Centre. His work focuses primarily on Australian strategic and defence policy, Asia-Pacific security issues, and global strategic affairs especially as they influence Australia and the Asia-Pacific.

He has served as an intelligence analyst with the Office of National Assessments, as a journalist with the Sydney Morning Herald, as a senior adviser on the staffs of Defence Minister Kim Beazley and Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and as a senior official in the Department of Defence, where from 1995 to 2000 he was Deputy Secretary for Strategy and Intelligence, and as the first Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). He was the principal author of Australia’s 2000 Defence White Paper.

The Strategic and Defence Studies Centre Public Lecture Series seeks to stimulate public discussion on major challenges relating to Australia’s strategic and defence policy and to contribute to the vital national conversation about Australia’s future in the Indo-Pacific.",1,[Music] well good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the fourth lecture the first this year of the strategic and

students who are here today and i know some of them uh who have personally benefited from his counsel from his insights from his very heartwarming personal touch it's extraordinary a man of a senior bureaucrat like that who was able to maintain the human touch and he really had it brendan first joined the university in 2018 as the principal of the military and defense studies program before he was appointed as professor of practice at the strategic and defence study centre he took over from me when i went to go and work on the asd history and the rest of that is history of course um but we

well particularly in the east days of the east timor crisis when i was a little bit wet behind the ears up in townsville and and then doing other things like that um he then went on to found the australian strategic policy institute um and he was the principal author of australia's 2000 defense white paper ladies and gentlemen a lot of that you probably already knew i have hopefully wetted your appetite what should be a fascinating presentation hugh over to you thank you well thank you john um and thanks to michelle and kian for bringing us all together here and how nice it is to be together in a room like this apart from a quick talk i gave a couple of weeks ago this is the first time i've spoken in front of a proper live audience for two years so i look a bit nervous and uncertain of myself you know anyway i want to say thank you all for coming look like john i just want to say a very few words about brendan sergeant it was of course as you'll have gathered from our biogs a colleague close colleague in defence for many years as well as a colleague here at at anu and um although i love my time in defence i really did and and i loved my colleagues it would be fair to say that a disproportionate number of the people you work with in defence apart from the military officers are either accountants or engineers and their two very fine professions and i wouldn't say a word against them but when one came across brendan in the room a colleague of immense learning and culture and grace and charm and wisdom there was always a sense of a breath of fresh air as well as a fresh and very important perspective on whatever you're doing and his loss is a great loss to all of us who knew him to sdsc and anu and the australian strategic policy community at a time when we need all the help we can get and it's also a kind of a shocking reminder of the fragility of things we take for granted including our friends and colleagues so of course it's not the only reminder we've had in the last little while about the fragility of things we take for granted because when brendan and i discussed this talk and this topic there was really one cold war we were talking about potential new cold war now or two and uh that does change the dynamics a bit or maybe there's one cold war with two fronts um i'm going to try and explore that topic a bit so i don't want to abandon my topic but on the other hand it would be superhuman and kind of stubborn not to talk a little bit about uh the elephant well if pepsi elephant's not in our room it's in somebody else's room but the the big new issue and so i'm going to say a few words about how i see the connection between the strategic crises that i see with us in east asia that constitutes that cold war the cold war in my topic and the strategic crisis in eastern europe and then i'll also return at the end to say a little bit about how i think the implications of all this connect so let me just start by saying a little bit about the interconnections i say between the strategic crises that we face in east europe and in east asia today and i use that term very deliberately i do think we face strategic crises of a very high order in both both ends of eurasia if i can put it that way those two crises are separate but they are connected they both constitute together and separately a crisis in the post-cold war global order that we've all grown pretty used to now because it's nearly 30 years old and most of us have loved it and we've got what we have is two connect separate but connected crises in two separate parts of the world in the one global order that came into being at the end of the cold war that order was based ultimately but very directly on u.s strategic primacy u.s global strategic primacy this is a big subject i'm just going to say one sentence about it but it's always been my view that the strategic order of whatever scale global or regional is defined by the issues upon which great powers believe they're willing to go to war with one another over so in the concert of europe in the 19th century the strategic order was defined by the fact that the great powers were all willing to go to war with one another to make sure that none of them became hegemonic in europe and ends globally in the cold war the order was defined by the by the fact that both superpowers were willing to go to war with one another and believe that they were willing to go to war with one another to avoid the other um gaining a significant advantage and disturbing the status quo and the defining feature of the post-cold war order was that the united states convinced everyone and believed themselves that they were willing to go to war to sustain their global supremacy and to support the order that that had been built on their vision of how the world should work and their values and so on and just to be crystal clear that was a really good order it really worked i think for the vast bulk of humankind it certainly worked very well for australia but it was it was welcomed by awful for a very larger portion of the world um but in order for that to be sustained it was necessary for countries around the world to accept that it was underpinned essentially by military power military power is the muscle beneath the skin and we often don't see the muscle beneath the skin in a in a in a in an international order when it's working well because it doesn't have to be used it's a bit like the you know the sort of the concealed firearm that the policeman carries you don't see it when it doesn't have to be used but it's there and it's it underpins the order they're sustained and it was but the fact that it was welcomed did require everyone to accept u.s primacy and that meant that everyone every country in the world had to had to relinquish for themselves the status of a great power no one could talk for a week about what i mean by the status of a great power but but to put it to try and put it succinctly the way i see things a great power is a power that has the capacity to shape the way the international system of which it's apart works and what we kind of had to relinquish all of us was was to the united states was that status as a great power now that was actually pretty easy for most of us to do it was easy for countries in the west it was easy for the countries of europe it was easy for countries like japan certainly for countries like australia we got used to us leadership during the cold war and we respected and admired it and it worked very well for us and it kind of fitted with an ideology that power politics was a thing of the past and there were a lot of countries in the world who didn't like it as much as we did but who tolerated it partly because they didn't have much choice and partly because they did also recognize although they were perhaps less enthusiastic about it than we in the old west were that it worked for them and i think for example i mean a lot of parts of the world are characterized this way but south east asia i think it broadly characterized that way but it has been resisted by some now those that those who've resisted it have not challenged the united states for global leadership but they have sought to challenge the united states leadership in their own regions they've sought great power status in their own region and they've sought in order to do that to minimise or exclude u.s influence in their region and establish a sphere of influence of their own that's one of the hallmarks of a great power you seek to exclude great power other great powers from your immediate neighborhood and uh you and you s seek a sphere of influence of your own um and you also seek equality with other great powers in this case with the united states at the global level you don't seek to dominate the united states at the global level but you do seek to function at a level of equality with the united states at the global level and a country that seeks that status is fundamentally challenging the u.s led order the u.s led global order of the post-cold war world because it disturbs the position of the united states and it disturbs the position of u.s regional allies u.s regional allies who are accepting u.s global primacy require the united states to function as the only great power in their own regions because if another country does start acting like a great power then they need to start acting like a great bear if you look at japan's predicament for example it was fine for japan to accept that it was not a great power in east asia and accepted america was a dominant power because there were no other great powers and the united states was going to keep any other great power any pretend any would be great power under control but as soon as another great power a country does arise as a great power then japan thinks oh is this working for me anymore or you can apply the same logic of course to europe and it doesn't require a lot of imagination to do that right now so all those countries around the world who are happy not being great powers and subcontracting the shaping of the international order of the united states they're happy to do that as long as everyone else did the same thing but when others start to violate it it starts it fails to work for everyone now there are there have been three of these significant great power challenges to the u.s led global order in their separate regions over the last decade iran in the middle east and one could talk a lot about that the the challenge in the middle east actually seemed a very significant one for a while but once one starts seeing challenges in even more important parts of the world like europe and east asia the middle east tends to drop away and i'm going to move past i won't talk about iran anymore the other two challenges of course are china and russia neither to seems to make incredibly bid for global power against the united states to compete with the united states at the global level to seek to become what the united states has been and take america's place at the global level but both can and are challenging the united states in their regions and of course they have a clear benefit in cooperating both seek to reassert their position as great powers in their own regions both seek to exclude the united states from their from their immediate regions both seek to establish a sphere of influence in their regions and those challenges uh were kind of kind of latent in the 90s became a little bit more clear in the tens and became totally i think fully overt in the years around 2008 and 2010. when come on pick the chronology a bit it's quite interesting to see how closely parallel the russian and the chinese challenge became overt with russia of course with the high points are the russian incursion into georgia of course the seizure of crimea and what we're seeing today with china that we can see the the beginnings of that with some more politically around the chinese response to the to the uh east to the global financial crisis to the uh the beginning of serious chinese pressure in the south china sea the beginning of serious chinese pressure in the east china sea um and so we've seen and now of course um with russia we've seen that challenge take a whole new dimension in in ukraine now the aim of both of them is to show that the united states cannot back its claim to primacy in their regions with armed force in other words the us is not willing to fight to stop them building their own spheres of influence and by doing that to undermine the credibility of the united states as a power in their region and to build their own to assert their own status as a great power in their region and what putin has done in the last few months in some ways and days obviously has taken a huge step forward it's the first time that a major power has used since the end of the cold war has used armed force to test america's ability to sustain its claim to global primacy by military force and of course the big question is whether taiwan is next whether xi jinping is emboldened to try and do in relation to taiwan precisely what putin has tried to do in relation to ukraine so that brings us back to east asia and my attempt to frame this around the concept of is this a new cold war america recognized china's challenge very clearly from the end of 2017 when the u.s national security strategy of december 17 just defined china and for that matter russia in the same paragraph as a strategic rival that that's what they meant by that phrase and the cold war analogy was surfaced almost immediately and the use of the analogy between the contest that that that was emerging between the us and china in east asia and the cold war was not just a matter of lazy columnists and for that matter lazy academics trying to find an easy way to explain what was going on because historical analogies do have great power and great significance a great power for good i mean in the end the only tools we can use to understand what on earth is going on around us is to try and draw on historical analogies and i would and i do it a lot myself and i would never knock it but historical analogies can also be very deceptive and very misleading they can be used to short-circuit debates they can be used for political advantage they can be used as political clubs and they can prejudice more serious analysis of what's going on because it's too easy to say okay this is this situation is just like that situation what we do now should just mirror what we did then and that's only right to which the extent to which the historical analogy is very close indeed and as mark twain famously said history doesn't repeat itself it rhymes and the rhyme is helpful but no two situations are the same and we can see the way in which the munich metaphor for example that every time a rising power is trying to do something we don't want it to do we we liken it to what happened in 1938 with hitler which has led us to some very foolish policy decisions and sewers in 1956 and vietnam in the mid-1960s in the invasion of iraq even and so i think it's very important that when we see these historical analogies appear we're very cautious about how far we accept them and how far we don't but we can also use them as i said to unpack the similarities and differences and we learn something about the situation we face today by exploring the similarities as well as the differences from what's gone before and of course the cold war analogy with the contest with china is irresistible in the sense that it is and the first time since the end of the cold war that we see strategic rivalry between the united states and another major power and of course the fact that that power happens to be communist does just add to the sort of color of the thing but i think it's a misleading analogy or the analogy is is misused in two different ways sometimes it's misused it's by those who who support the analogy who say it is like the cold war this is a new cold war and they use that to shortcut in the way i just described a shortcut debate about what's at stake and how hard we should fight we all know about the cold war everything was at stake we pushed like mad and we won so if this is just like the last goal if this is a cold war again then all of those same things apply and that's a bad idea because we have to go back and analyze much more carefully what really is at stake in the contest with china and how hard should we really push and what are our chances of winning but there's also i think misleading uh this also leads to a misleading debate by those who say that it's nothing like the cold war because that's proposition is often used to imply that the costs and risks involved in the contest are much lower that we don't need to worry about it so much this is all going to be fine it's not going to be fine because we're going to win the way we did with the cold war it's going to be fine because the whole thing's just going to drift away and that's a very dangerous proposition as well overall i think the cold war analogy the cold war metaphor has encouraged the assumption the assumptions that this is not too bad that either it's like the old club war and we're going to win it or it's not really like the old club war and it doesn't really matter whereas i think it really matters and it's going to be really hard so let me just try and pick out some of the ways in which i think the cold war analogy works and some of the ways in which i don't think it does how is the us-china contest in each asia like the cold war and how is it different and how reassured or alarmed should we be by the similarities and differences well let me just start by very quickly listing some of the obvious ways in which it is just like the cold war from rather which it's not like the cold war the first is of course the people always point out to is that during the cold war the soviet world and the west were almost completely separate economically whereas today the economic integration is like that the second is that the integration is not just economic but social and human there's an enormous connectivities at every level between china and the west between china and the united states including a huge amount of people movement the third is that the that the contest today lacks the idea the sharp ideological edge of the cold war between capitalism and communism now there is a sort of a question about that in some people's mind and i think it's an issue that's interesting to discuss but as a broad proposition i think that's right i don't think what we're seeing here is a clash of ideologies i think it's much more traditional clash of power political ambitions and the fourth way in which it's obviously different is that china doesn't have the have a block the way the soviet union did the soviet union led a big group of nations relatively powerful nations some of them um and china doesn't china is much more alone and there are significant i think significant ways in which uh uh the the the cold war today is not like the old cold war and the ones that are often cited in the debates you see in the in in in the literature the less obvious and less obvious but i think in some ways more important way in which the analogy is obviously incorrect is that china's aims are very different from i think china's aims are very different from the soviet arms the soviet union at least at the start really did aim to dominate the world and that uh and and in a way that i'll touch on a bit later that was not an impossible not a not a wholly implausible objective for the soviet union to have um and so it was it really was a rival for the united with the united states for global hegemony um china i don't believe is that and again i'll explain why i think that in a little while but china's ambition is to become the dominant power in east asia and the western pacific that is itself a very radical very significant and in many ways very disturbing ambition but is not the same as trying to dominate the world [Music] if the 10th of china has a global ambition it is the ambition to be at least an equal with the united states on the global stage i i don't see evidence that china actually wants to rule the world um and in broad terms all of those differences that i've just listed are kind of reassuring that's on the reassuring side of the thing okay this is a this is going to be manageable it's not going to be so hard but there are a whole lot of other differences which i think are much less reassuring the first is that the contest between the us and china is much more equal than the contest between the us and the soviet union for a simple really important reason and that is that china's economy is as big as america's functionally and it's important to remember that out on its best day the soviet economy was never more than about half the size of america's it was the second biggest economy in the world which is also worth remembering but it was only half the size of america's and and the fact that china is relative to the united states much more powerful than any rival the united states has ever faced before is a very significant difference and a very scary one the second difference which is not reassuring is that although china has no allies it has a lot of friends well friends has a lot of customers um and they count as friends actually i mean we're we're seeing an interesting demonstration at the moment it's just how deep those economic links go uh for a country like russia but but i don't think we can we we should never underestimate how significant china's enormous role in the global economy is in underpinning its diplomatic and in the long-term its strategic position and that's very different the soviet union the soviet union had a block and some of those and at times for example when it had china in its block um or some of the countries in eastern europe little significant strategic assets but i had very few friends no friends really and and i think china china's position is therefore much stronger than the soviets was the next the next um unreassuring difference is that the compared to the cold war the objectives of the two rivals in the u.s china contest in each asia are much more asymmetrical now i said a minute ago that that at the beginning at least of the cold war the soviet union was trying to achieve world domination but actually that that passed pretty quickly when it discovered what a serious rifle the united states was and i think for the bulk of the cold war um the core objectives of both sides was to preserve the status quo the united states wanted to make sure the soviet union's influence didn't grow any bigger than it already was and the soviet union wanted to make sure that america's influence didn't grow any bigger than it was they wanted to preserve their respective global spheres of influence they carved out for themselves at the end of the second world war and in the early years of the cold war and they had they both had quite a lot invested in that objective because that the status quo that they were both trying to protect gave them equal status there were two superpowers they were seen and were seen by one another as having equal status and in the process each accepted the other sphere of influence it is important to remember this um you know sears have influenced you know lincoln in melbourne just last uh just last month uh talked about how civilians of influence are a terrible thing and shouldn't be countenanced well for any american statesmen to say that given that they've exercised a sphere of influence in the western hemisphere since 1824 is a bit cheeky but the fact is that it's not just that they claim their own sphere of influence they recognize russia's views soviet's fear of influence that's what they did at yalta and they didn't like it but if we look at the history of the cold war repeatedly when the soviets did bad things in eastern europe in poland in hungary and czechoslovakia united states sent you know  didn't mind but in the end said okay that's your part of the world you do what you want to do and the contrast with east asia today is very stark because in each days of the day the united states does not exceed to acknowledge china as having a sphere of influence in fact the u.s strategic objective in east asia to the extent that one can see one is to deny china the sphere of influence that it's trying to build and so whereas during the cold war the two superpowers would had a very symmetrical set of objectives they were each trying to preserve a status quo that they both broadly accepted and their aim was to try and make sure that the other didn't upset it in in the context between the u.s and china in asia today china is trying to get something that the united states is denying it and that makes china much more dissatisfied than the soviet union was for the bulk of the cold war and therefore makes it more resolved and therefore a more dangerous adversary the third difference and it flows from that second one is that uh is a difference in the clarity of resolve on both sides one of the most distinctive things about the cold war and the reason we call it the cold war and not world war iii because it never went hot was that both superpowers were extremely cautious about the use of armed force against one another because both put it the other way neither doubted the resolve of the other one of the most distinctive things about those long scary decades is that when all was said and done and there were a few bad days in the office uh berlin a couple of times cuba obviously but most of the time both sides were absolutely convinced that if the other one that if they pushed their tanks across the iron curtain across the line down the middle of europe they would be in a war and the war would go nuclear they didn't doubt that the other side would fight and that was immensely stabilizing the fact that both sides had a very high confidence in the resolve of the other meant that neither side was at all tempted to try anything on and that was and that's and that was a very significant and very in retrospect we can see a very reassuring part of what made the cold war uh the the in the end in a weird way the peaceful order it was um and that's particularly notable on the part of the united states the fact that the united states could could convince the soviet union that it was willing to fight to defend berlin in a war that would that everyone knew would well we're pretty sure will quickly escalate to a nuclear exchange and that nuclear exchange could include devastating nuclear attack on the continental united states the fact that the united states could convince the kremlin that they are willing to fight that war is a pretty remarkable thing and it was a major achievement of u.s statecraft if they hadn't convinced the soviets of that then it's very likely that the cold war would have ended very differently from the way it did um and it's particularly notable because of course that proposition is so contrary to what one you know what one should i think still legitimately see as a fundamental tenant of american statecraft and that is that being a continent that dominates of being continental power that dominates its own hemisphere and which is guarded by two very broad oceans isolationism comes very naturally and is a very sensible policy the reason why the united states succeeded in convincing the soviet universe resolve was that they convinced the soviet union that americans believe that even in their own hemisphere with those broad nations on either side a soviet union that dominated for example that came to dominate western europe would come to dominate eurasia and any country that dominated eurasia as a whole could threaten the united states despite it the inherent security of its geographical endowment and of course and that and the united states was right to fear that the soviet union particularly early in the cold war had the capacity to dominate eurasia because the other countries in eurasia were small and weak um well were weak if even if they weren't small they there was china a very poor country and of course for the first portion of the cold war a soviet strategic asset there was india there was western europe at the beginning of the cold war flat on its back uh devastated by world war ii the soviet union was by miles the strongest power in eurasia and without u.s supporters capacity to dominate eurasia was pretty clear and so it was quite easy that being true for the united states to persuade the soviets that they regarded the americans regarded their security at home in the western hemisphere as depending on defending berlin and therefore they were willing to fight that kind of devastating war in order to do so now in east asia today that's much less clear um i think the united states strongly believes that that china understands its resolve and i think there's a kind of assumption in the united states that its resolve is is strong but if you look at the fundamental foundations of that resolve why would the united states have to fight to defend taiwan say the way the united states had to fight to defend berlin the rationale looks much weaker and the rationale looks weaker because the united states security is not nearly as badly affected by a china which ends up dominating taiwan or goes on as it easily could to dominate east asia in the western pacific as it would have been by a soviet union that went on to dominate eastern western europe and then went on to dominate eurasia because no matter how well the chinese do in east asia and the western pacific even if they achieve domination over that very substantial area it can't go on to dominate eurasia because although china is very strong relative to the united states compared to the soviet union it's weaker relative to the other countries in the system compared to india compared to russia compared to europe china is not as strong as the soviet union was compared to the other countries in eurasia during the cold war and so the chances of china dominating eurasia are much lower and the chances of china being able to dominate being able to threaten the united states is therefore lower the imperative of the united states to prevent china dominating east asia and the western pacific is therefore lower and and that's and that doesn't just weaken america's um imperatives it undermines the credibility of its resolve in beijing which gets me back to the point that that the clarity of resolve on both sides which was such a critical part of what kept the cold war stable is much weaker in in this new cold war than it was during the old one and the last point which flows from that the last difference which is unreassuring is the relative weakness of the united states actual response to the challenge from china because if you go back and look at what the united states did in the first decade of the cold war for example compare it with what the united states start or even the first five years the cold war compared what the united states has done in the years since 2017 when it declared china a strategic rifle well i don't think it really measures up in the first five years of the cold war the united states built nato it built its alliance structure in the western pacific including australia it's it it deployed massive u.s forces to europe and asia and it drove defense spending through the roof and it kept defence spending high it's important to remember in the 50s and 60s us defense spending moved up and down between eight and ten percent of gdp eight and ten percent of gdp at that level the cold war really was a war the spending was unbelievable it's kind of more sobering to note that it was 4.9 of gdp in 2010 and today it's 3.7 you don't want to overstate these things but it does tell you a lot is this does this feel to you and more importantly does it feel to xi jinping like a country which is taking on an intense strategic rivalry with the most formidable power it's ever faced not a 3.7 percent of gdp so there's some very important dissimilarities all of which to me point towards a contest which is much less stable than the cold war ended up being there are also some similarities which are not reassuring the first similarity that's not reassuring is that as quickly became apparent in the old cold war if it comes to a war the us can't win at the conventional level one of the decisive things about the cold war was that it very rapidly became clear that in a war in europe against the vast bulk of the red army the united states could not win a conventional war which is why it had to rely on nuclear weapons and the first use of nuclear weapons and for a long time that was the opposite was a case in asia because any significant war in asia is going to be primarily maritime the united states has been the dominant maritime power globally for as far as anyone can remember and uh and china in particular had very weak maritime forces but today this is a long story i won't go into it but today the united states has lost its assured maritime supremacy as china's capacity to deny it freedom of movement in the western pacific has grown very substantially the second similarity and what that means that the united states has has a as ahead during the cold war a strong imperative to rely on nuclear weapons to achieve what his conventional forces can't achieve the second this unreassuring similarity is that this is a war that's going to be very hard to keep limited there is a strong argument in the united states including by some of the most significant strategic thinkers in the united states that you know there's good news here and that is that unlike the cold war this war could easily be kept limited i think there's very little evidence to support that the stakes for both sides are very high i think for the reasons i've explained they're higher for china they are for the united states but they are but they are very high if it's a limited war it's because the united states because it stakes a lower backs off and and doesn't win if the united states doesn't back off this is not a war that gets that's limited at all and the third point the third similarity which is not uh reassuring is that both the nuclear powers and the risk of nuclear escalation is is very high um one dissimilarity which is not reassuring one more dissimilarity that's not reassuring is that this is not well recognized at least in the united states i at least am continually surprised by how often people discussing the analogy with the cold war say one of the difference is that in the cold war nuclear weapons were something we're really worried about and we don't have to worry about them now really the argument is often put is that's because china only has 400 nuclear warheads well it's just worth remembering the time of the that is 10 roughly speaking of what the united states says it's just worth remembering at the time of the cuban missile crisis the soviet union had about 10 percent of of america's nuclear stockpile but we were but we worried about it a lot new 400 nuclear warheads even with defenses and so on even with preemptive strikes can still destroy half a dozen american cities and kill millions of millions of americans so well taken together the similarities and differences between the cold war and the east asian crisis suggests to me that the east asian contest we're seeing at the moment is harder for america to win than the cold war is more likely to lead to war is more likely to lead to a nuclear war and it's more likely that the united states will manage that those three facts by withdrawing because its stakes aren't high enough and that of course all has very significant implications for australia and for that matter for our neighbours in asia so just back to ukraine for a minute the us decision not to fight in ukraine is still the second most important thing that's happened in the last couple of months the most important of course being putin's decision to invade but the us decision not to fight is enormously significant because when confronted with the test is it willing to fight to preserve the military foundation of the post-cold war global order the first time it faced that test really seriously by confronting a major power the answer was no now of course there's also a test for putin going on here and a test for russia and the outcome of that test is not yet settled one of the things that's being tested is whether given that it chose not to fight the u.s led order can be sustained and putin's use of armed force defeated without going to war by using economic means now all of us who've grown up over the last few decades and have been around this boy a few times before are inclined to say economic sanctions don't work and i do that's that's my board my broad hypothesis but these these sanctions are different you know feels a bit different maybe this time will be different and if so that'll be a very interesting day in the office but if not if if they can't deliver a decisive defeat to putin one way or another and in a reasonable time frame not weeks or months but a couple of years then the failure of that economic mechanism will show that the u.s lacks the power to sustain the global role it claims and that will of course have immense implications in asia as well as in europe and and and you know and china will be encouraged to to run the same kind of test of u.s resolve in relation to taiwan that putin is running in relation to the ukraine and that's something we can learn just finally by looking a little bit more closely at what that challenge in europe really means in europe because if ukraine is subjugated then the key question that will face the rest of europe is it having failed to prevent russia reasserting itself as a great power the question will then be how does europe deal with it as a great power how far does it allow russia to expand its sphere of influence even further than it will have done westwards and southwards now these are not new questions this has been how far west and south do you allow russia to go not just territorially but in terms of predominant influence has been one of the principal questions of us of european statecraft since peter the great since russia became a great power and the usual answer looking at how far west you're allowed to go is halfway through poland that that's where they that's where the germans i don't just mean the people of germany the germans the austrians that whole that that's normally where they've said to the russia that far and no further and that's one of the reasons why poland has got such a shitty history i mean you wouldn't laugh if you were polish and it's you know that that's really the question that europe faces now now if if i was standing in front of a european audience i've actually done this um and nobody loves if you stand in front of a european audience today the answer they give the nato answer is that we stop it at the nato boundary the boundary of the of the of the expanded nato that we see today which of course includes the baltic states and poland and so on and the but the problem particularly in relation to the baltics is that they were bought into nato without serious thought of how hard it would be to defend them and whether it was really necessary for the rest of europe to defend them i think it's possible i'm sure it's possible for nato to defend the baltics but it will be immensely costly and there is a question as to whether other other countries in nato the old nato countries in particular the ones with the real strategic weight in western europe are willing to bear the burdens of doing that and so the boundary may be pushed further back which is bad news for the baltics um and and before we say another the europeans would never do that because they're so committed to the idea of nato and and they are there's a real emotional pull in in berlin and paris and london and rome to the idea that that brussels the idea that nato's new borders have to be sustained but there's another there's a countervailing factor in what one might call a european strategic psyche and that is the old idea which draws on centuries of experience of managing power politics amongst great powers in that very crowded strategic space which is in europe which is a great powers have to be given some room that was a whole idea behind the concert of europe in the 19th century for example and in a different way was the idea behind the wacky system that they ran during the 18th century and so the thought the boundary might be further back into europe is not out of the question but that boundary will have to be drawn somewhere and wherever it's drawn it's going to have to be drawn real hard against the russia of today with a regime that looks anything like putin's and it might well be putin's for a long time to come then that line wherever it is is going to have to be drawn not with battalions little token presences tripwires but with army corps permanently deployed right up against the boundary that really is a new cold war in that respect and that is going to be immensely costly and immensely difficult to sustain uh now we can and the real question is who will do that and who will lead america will but the question we're going to ask ourselves is whether going back to the point i made about america's motives whether in the long run not this year or next year but a decade from now america will see its imperatives to defend western europe as sufficiently important to warrant those costs because it is worth bearing in mind america doesn't have to do it europe is strong enough to contain russia itself because europe the united europe of today is immensely strong and much stronger than russia much stronger than russia where it chooses to draw a line it can stop them if they want to and so i think there's a fair chance that it won't be america that leads this effort and if it's not america it's germany and that's a very interesting day in the office for everyone but you know the chancellor's statements just what 36 hours ago you know i mean lots of things happen that you don't really expect well that's that's one of them that's the third most interesting thing that's happened after this russian movement and the american decision not to invade so there's a real chance i think that that we are going to see a strategic revolution in europe which will see you work very differently um but in a way just sort of back to the old days back to giving great power space and so on the difference being that western europe will be functioning as a single great power europe indeed will be functioning uh the bits that can be kept from russia will be functioning as single-grade power okay very briefly in asia it's different because the difference in east asia is that whereas the europeans in their new form with all of that wealth and power and all of that unity which they've built so painfully and i think notwithstanding our british friends so impressively over the years since the end of the second world war they are strong enough to contain russia but but we in east asia are not strong enough to contain china if the united states bugs out then partly because of the sheer economic weight of china compared to the rest of us it's bigger than the rest of us put together in east asia and partly because india won't be part of it because it's just not close enough it's not part of the east asian system it really has its own strategic system over there in in the indus in in the indian ocean and south asia um india will ensure that china doesn't dominate asia as a whole but it won't ensure that it doesn't dominate east asia russia and europe will ensure that china doesn't dominate eurasia as a whole and that's a reminder of how important russia is always going to be to us no matter how mad we might be with it today but um but the us can live with because of those things the us can live with that chinese dominated east asia so it's a different outcome different process rather from from what we what we see in europe but the same outcome because the us the us does not have the imperative that it used to have to sustain the global order that it promulgated at the end of the cold war and so the chances of of the us abandoning east asia i think are much higher than most other people do it was always clear that the great strategic question of at least the early part of the 21st century was whether or how the united states would sustain or would lose the astonishing position of global primacy that it exercised on the 1st of january 2001 at the dawn of the century and for a decade now we have seen the pressures on the united states on its capacity to sustain that order building and now they have broken out in very dramatic terms and it does seem to me that the cold war provides no very helpful guide and no very reassuring evidence as to what happens next thank you very much [Music] you
saJol19urp4,The coalitions presidents make: Presidential power and its limits in democratic Indonesia,"Political scientists have conventionally suggested that presidential systems operating in multi-party regimes face problems of stability and effectiveness.

In recent years, however, a new school of thought has introduced the concept of ""coalitional presidentialism"" to argue that presidents can achieve stability by forming post-electoral coalitions with legislative parties. The Indonesian case fits into this model, but as I will argue in this presentation, the country's post-2004 system goes well beyond the boundaries of traditional coalitional presidentialism.

While coalitional presidentialism scholars have exclusively focused on the alliances built between presidents and parties in the legislature, Indonesian presidents have treated non-party actors as coalition partners whose status and rights are equal to those of political parties. Concretely, they have included representatives of the military, the police, the bureaucracy, local government, the oligarchy and Muslim organizations in cabinet in order to protect themselves not only from threats originating in the legislature, but from attacks by other potential veto powers as well.

Beyond cabinet representation, these non-party actors are integrated into presidential administrations through a continuous process of negotiation and re-calibration, in which the red lines (that is, non-negotiable vested interests) of both sides are defined and defended.

As a result, Indonesia's post-2004 presidentialism has achieved a level of stability that sets it apart from many of its international peers and its own transitional experiences between 1998 and 2004. But the price paid for this stability has been high: in their endeavour to maintain the solidity of their governments, presidents have made substantial concessions to their partners that have eroded democratic quality.

Ultimately, a regime emerged that maintains stability for the actors benefitting from its existence, and excludes those deemed not important enough to warrant participation.

Marcus Mietzner is Associate Professor in the Department of Political and Social Change at the ANU Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs. His research interests include the political role of the military in Indonesia; Indonesian political parties, particularly campaign financing issues; elections in Indonesia; and comparative electoral politics in Southeast Asia.",1,it's nice to see so many familiar faces here uh in the audience today um uh let my let me begin uh by saying that um here at the anu we acknowledge and celebrate the first australians on whose traditional lands we meet and we pay respect to the elders past and present today we have a um a very important and as you can see very popular uh or well-subscribed seminar uh by our colleague associate professor marcus mitzner marcus is very well known as one of the leading scholars of indonesian politics he's previously written two very widely read and widely cited books one on the indonesian military and political islam during indonesia's democratic transition and another book on indonesian political parties and has of course apart from those books has maintained a quite formidable publishing record with numerous articles on many aspects of indonesian politics edited volumes and so on so today we're fortunate to get a sort of an advanced insight uh into the new book he's writing uh which as you can see is on uh presidential power in indonesia uh so marcus will speak for about 45 minutes uh if you have questions or comments please hold them to the end and then we'll have a similar amount of time dedicated to q a at the end thanks marcus take it away thank you ed and thanks everyone for uh joining just a few special welcomes to bill little for instance who is here who is also writing a book on indonesian presidents uh i think we will establish that our books are rather different so we're not colliding uh much in in this regard but uh thanks a lot um for for being here also everyone from the united states sydney jones meredith and others uh and ben kirkfleet from hawaii thank you all for for being here and of course many friends from indonesia as well so you see here what i hope the title will be of this book so the coalition's presidents make presidential power and its limits in democratic indonesia let me just move okay so this is essentially borrowed this title is borrowed from this quite influential book which was written on american presidents and the way they influence policy making and the making of politics in the united states the general theory of this book being that each american president has been an innovator who has shaped american politics in in certain ways now for the indonesian case uh that obviously is rather different and what i'm trying to argue here is that indonesian presidents largely leave their mark by how they make their coalitions hence this title so this is what i'm going to do today obviously a lot to go through it's a pretty thick book so i can't cover it all i hope that whatever isn't um covered for you can be raised in the q a but first of all i want to set so the conceptual and theoretical setting in which this book is operating then present the main arguments of the book then talk about presidentialism in indonesia what i'm talking about and what i'm not talking about then so the core of the book is about uh how presidents manage coalitional presidentialism in indonesia how are alliances established and maintained over time uh the fifth part is then and very important one how presidential management of coalitions has interplayed with democratic decline the sixth part then we need to ask of course why this spectacular this specific form of coalitional presidentialism has taken roots in indonesia and then finally some comparative um reflections so first of all the conceptual and theoretical problem that this book tries to address so in political science there has been for many decades now a discussion about the perils of presidentialism this goes back to a piece juan linz wrote in 1994 which argued that presidentialism is a bad choice for young democracies it's unstable it is uh vulnerable to overthrows of presidents and the fourth who can't manage to stay in power and he expressed a preference then for uh parliamentarism now there have been some people already back then in 1994 who didn't buy this argument and who reminded juan linz that what he was really talking about was not presidentialism as such but the problem of presidentialism in fragmented multi-party systems right so main wiring and others uh reminded juan linz you have to be very specific about what kind of presidentialism you mean when you talk about inherent instability and mind worrying said it's largely the focus what we need to have here has to be on fragmented multi-party systems so a question then in this debate has been how stable is presidentialism particularly in system where a we have an atomized multi-party ism in place and b as a result of that presidents who do not hold a majority in the legislature and the latest answer to this question has been by this team of researchers from oxford university paul chastey nick cheeseman and tim power who published in 2017 this volume they created this concept of coalitional presidentialism and this was the book that came out of this long research project now what is coalitional presidentialism exactly about the main argument of this school of thought is that minority presidents can achieve stability of their rule by forming post-election coalitions with parties in the legislature and i've underlined this here because this is important that is their focus right so their whole research focus is on interaction between presidents and parties in the main arena of the legislature in order to manage these coalitions presidents have a set of tools available to achieve this goal um so they're five and they call this the presidential toolkit of coalitional presidentialism first the legislative prerogatives of presidents second partisan powers by which they mean the control of presidents over their own parties and thirdly cabinet authority which is largely appointment powers then budgetary authority and finally the exchange of favors so the argument here is if presidents use these strategies these tools out of their toolkit effectively then they can achieve remarkably stable rule even though they only have a minority in the legislature and in fact so again coming back to the concerns that juan linz had coalitional presidentialism not only makes presidential systems operational but in fact quite remarkably stable now you don't have to be an expert in indonesian politics to note that indonesia obviously fits into that model both jokowi and judy yono have approached this uh problem of coalition of presidentialism in that way both came to power as minority presidents but then built post-election coalitions with parties in the legislature but let's have a look at how several polities that are traditionally researched by coalition of presidentialism scholars have done in terms of preserving stability and i've mixed indonesia into uh this set of countries here and i've used four very broad indicators of uh stability of presidential uh systems the first is attempted impeachment the second successful impeachment the third is incumbency loss because incumbency losses indicate uh problems in the governing coalition or more broadly in the effectiveness of governance and the fourth is post office prosecution because that also uh underlines the risk for presidents that they take when they rule um in minority governments when then often oppositions but often also their own allies come after them after uh their office uh that term has expired so if you look at all these indicators you see quite a bit is happening in a number of countries peru obviously outstanding here i think since 1985 there has been only one short-term president who has not been indicted or imprisoned after leaving office and you also see quite a number of successful impeachments just in the last few years you can have a look at the other countries but of course the attention i want you know to raise here is towards the case of indonesia we have not seen even the beginnings of an attempted impeachment let alone a successful impeachment since 2004 which is the area uh the era that i'm looking at here we've had no incumbency loss and no president has been prosecuted after leaving office so even by international standards you see that indonesia has achieved with its presidential system quite a remarkable level of stability we also of course need to compare that to the presidential system of indonesia prior to 2004 so in that transitional period between 1998 and 2004 we would have had impeachments attempted impeachment successful impeachments you know if you go through the presidents from 1998 to 2004 so how to of course overthrown by a popular uprising than habibi forced by the npr to resign because his accountability report was rejected then president wide was impeached in 2001 and megawati lost the elections of 2004 so quite a number of instability indicators there but all of that changed after 2004. again quite unusual not even the beginnings the technical beginnings of a single and attempted impeachment so by using coalitional presidentialism strategies indonesia's presidential system went from extreme instability which i just outlined to extraordinary stability even by the international standards we just looked at so the main question here is how did it get there and what are the implications of this shift so let me run through the main arguments of the book so that you know where the journey is going so the first main argument is that post 2004 presidents have governed through a system of coalitional presidentialism that not only accommodated legislative parties but a range of other non-party actors as well and the implication of course here is that that leaves the traditional arena of the conventional coalitional presidentialism studies which are exclusively focused on the interaction between presidents and parties in the legislature so first main argument we have a very peculiar form of coalitional presidentialism in indonesia where non-party actors are situated in the same way as coalition partners of the presidents as political parties are and this is just one indicator here what i'm talking about obviously inclusion in a cabinet is a strong expression of coalition on presidentialism normally again we look at which parties get seats but if we look behind those calculations we actually find that a number of groups non-party groups in indonesia have always been integrated into cabinets since 2004. the numbers are fluctuating but in most cases they get represented you see here for instance the military the police local government bureaucracy oligarchs and muslim groups who over time see their numbers in cabinet fluctuating but in most cases they can count on being integrated into cabinet i should also add of course that a lot of these groups also find additional representation through party channels i have this included here for instance for the military divided by non-party cabinet seats and party seats and i've done the same for the oligarchs you know who sometimes make their way into cabinet through party avenues but in other cases uh through non-party lines as well and i could do the same in fact for muslim groups where of course we have anu represented through pika bay but also through non-party uh avenues um as as well so this is just an initial teaser for you to see what i'm talking about here and i also i want to make that clear for me cabinet representation is not the only form of coalition of presidentialism there's a whole lot more going on a lot more demands that these groups have towards the president outside of cabinet that are also uh and equally important so the second argument i want to highlight here is that the post 2004 system has enabled a complex mechanism of coalition management into which both sides balance each other pretty well and that means for the study of indonesia that presidents today are neither new suhartos nor are they puppets of cartels or oligarchies which is what you often get in the debate about indonesia jokowi now quite frequently portrayed as the new sahara and so forth and then on the other side of the debate you feel you see a lot of uh concepts by the oligarchy school for instance that presidents are essentially puppets um exchangeable puppets of party cartels or oligarchies and i'm arguing that neither is true and in fact it's the balance that has marked indonesian politics the most since 2004. so we have seen that indonesia's presidential system has been extraordinarily stable compared to international peers and compared to its pre-2004 version but the price for this stability has been high it has been democratic decline we have presidents and coalition partners who protect a labyrinth of red lines meaning he invested interest to keep the coalition intact and one of the the main arguments of the book is indeed that it's the red lines of all of these actors on the side of the president as well as the party and non-party actors that really shape the coalitions that they built together and because of these red lines that run through the coalitions none of the areas of democratic quality that today would need repair in indonesia have been touched in fact actors have reclaimed privileges lost in earlier periods of democratization so the more conceptual conclusion then is that if you go back to juan linz the problem of coalitional presidentialism and presidential systems more broadly is then no longer the question of how stability can be achieved remember that was the starting point of this debate the stability itself now has become the problem right so we no longer need to really think about we have don't have to be so concerned with presidents about how they can achieve stability but in fact we need to talk about the damaging impacts of the stability that has been achieved now in my work i draw from previous uh works of course just mentioning a few here uh slater has written about cartels and promiscuous power sharing and of course some of that flows into my book here but i still have some dividing lines with that approach so presidents in in my um concept are not instruments of cartels and intra-coalitional competition is actually not only very high but it's central to the working of the alliance dick thompson has also written some very good pieces on this issue he's talked about strategic groups that presidents have to accommodate but yes sort of shied away from explicitly situating these strategic groups as coalition partners of the president that are at par with parties which is what i do in the book and then adds peace for instance on irony the irony of success some time ago which argued that the stability of indonesian democracy was largely bought through the accommodation of potential veto powers i'll take this argument and essentially demonstrate how that works in practice in the operation of presidential coalitions so let me say a few words about presidentialism in indonesia what i'm talking about and what i'm not talking about so my book will be about post 2004 uh presidentialism in indonesia there are several reasons for this one being quite ironically if you use the strict parameters of presidentialism presidential systems none of the systems that were in place in indonesia up until 2004 would actually qualify as full presidentialism uh because technically up until 2004 the president in indonesia was elected by a legislative body by the npr and for strict presidentialism scholars that means it's actually semi presidentialism but of course the reality on the ground has been quite different so historically this is how i would um you know distinguish the various faces of presidentialism in indonesia so we had a very very brief period of executive presidentialism up until about from august to november 1945 socano then pretty quickly uh handed over most of the executive power to the legislature and so we have seen ceremonial presidentialism from 45 to about 59 then we had again if you took the strict parameters it would not be full presidentialism because the president was appointed by the npr but because presidents were so dominant in controlling the legislature i would speak about autocratic presidentialism and then we had sort of a hybrid version a transitional presidentialism from 1998 to 2004. again the president's still elected by the mpr and it's only really since since we had the popular election of the president which for presidentialism scholars is really a constituting element of presidentialism uh we've had that in place and so this is what i'm focusing on full presidentialism which then uh turned out to be a form of coalitional presidentialism now coalitional presidentialism is all about managing powers both sides of the equation so presidents and their coalition partners are throwing their various powers and assets into the negotiations over the form of the coalition on the presidential side and i'm just going briefly through some of these main powers of course co-legislative powers this is quite unique in indonesia uh presidents um have a full veto right over legislation which is quite different from other countries here in indonesia presidents must agree from the very beginning with a piece of legislation with the parliament for the piece of legislation to become law if the president at any stage of that process indicates this approval then the law cannot uh proceed so this is one really major power uh presidents have there's also a whole range of executive regulatory powers that presidents have that parliament for instance doesn't have right so parliament can make laws with the president but it can't issue any other regulations the president can starting from government regulations presidential regulations and so forth and so forth where the president can outside of laws issue a whole range of uh regulations of course appointment powers we've talked about cabinet but there's a whole lot of others um whether that's uh in the police in the military in the bureaucracy in state on enterprises all of that makes the presidency incredibly important to the actors that seek to be part of the coalition and of course budgetary powers a lot of the book is about how money is being used to tie actors into the coalition uh that is extremely important as well and of course something that uh chase d cheeseman and power had also highlighted in the conventional coalition of presidentialism studies the last three here are sort of additions which i find are very important but not sufficiently highlighted and the existing coalitional presidentialism literature and that's coercive powers so the president's control of the military and the police and law enforcement although presidents often for the public deny that they have this power but in practice they actually do extremely important to keep coalition partners in line whether it's about pursuing or not pursuing legal cases of actors in the coalition and so forth all of that uh really central and then what i would really situate here as the key um so political capital that the president has outside of the structural powers and that's popularity very simple popularity and popular legitimacy because if you look at you know a lot of the oligarchs a lot of the party leaders a lot of the military leaders police leaders they would love to be president but can't because they can't mobilize uh this level of popularity so it's not that people like buckery or verranto and so forth um enjoy the fact that they needed to support somebody else as president it was really because they couldn't they they did not get to a level of political capital that allowed them to gain the presidency themselves so they were forced to align themselves with figures who could mobilize that popularity so extremely important and then finally the high impeachment threshold that the constitution now sets which protects the president um from uh impeachment procedures which is also a major weapon now for uh presidents now on the other side yeah in the book of course this is spelled out in much detail and i'll do this by group but let me just summarize some of the powers the coalition partners can bring to the table on the side of the parties we have the nomination power so the political parties made sure that presidents need to be nominated by political parties there are no independent candidacies for the presidency as you would see in other countries we have co-legislative and budgetary powers especially by legislators and local governments we have coercive monopolies by the military and police we have policy implementation powers by the bureaucracy and local government and of course uh electoral mobilization by parties and muslim groups the provision of funds by oligarchs religious legitimacy which is provided by muslim groups all of these things are important for presidents to ensure effectiveness of governance and it's an incentive to integrate the groups that provide these these assets into the presidential coalition so for all of these groups a corporation or non-cooperation is crucial in determining effectiveness of government so from the perspective of presidents often that is the threshold by which groups are integrated into the coalition or not if the cooperation of a particular actor is needed to guarantee stability and effectiveness of governance then often an offer is made for coalition participation if groups are not crucial to uh the stability and effectiveness of governance then they find themselves outside of the coalition parameters so the the post 2004 system has established a balance of power so we have now seen the presidential powers and the powers from the other side by the coalition partners so we have a balance of power in which both the president and coalition partners gain more from cooperation than confrontation because that's the question we have to ask ourselves why don't we see the frequent attempts at impeachment why don't we see many more popular mobilizations to remove a president as we have seen in other countries and that is because a lot of these actors have come to the conclusion that they need to cooperate with the president and that confrontation would come at a cost that is um too high so at the end of the day these two uh sort of institutional interests from both sides balance each other out so now to the details of the management of coalitional presidentialism and that's really the core of the book the book is structured uh by actors actually i look at parties i look at parliament i look at the military the police bureaucracy local government oligarchs and muslim groups in all of these chapters i go through which powers these actors can bring to the table in order to entice presidents to invite them into coalitions i then balance that against the powers that the president holds over these particular groups then i'll look at how this relationship is being managed and in each chapter i have one case study to illustrate how this often happens in practice but the first chapter is actually about the infrastructure that the president has at his disposal in order to manage the coalition so you see here the setup of the presidential uh office if you like the presidential infrastructure at the moment in 2021 and so if you look here at two main actors the state secretariat and the cabinet secretary these are the two bodies at the moment that manage different sides of the coalitions that the president needs to draw into the alliance the state secretariat um currently uh it's in there he is taking um sorry this is uh platiknow the state secretariat he is taking care of the non-party arrangements of the coalition so he often would approach those partners of the coalition that are not political parties the cabinet secretaries this is a party official from pdip he is often in charge to lead the negotiations with political parties over coalition arrangements if you look below the level of the state secretariat very important here is the military secretariat because that's the official channel of the president to deal with the military and importantly with the police as well because the police is under the military secretary you could of course expand this uh graph quite a bit you have pas pam press which is also an informal line for the president to deal with the military you have the accidents which are below the military secretariat which are also providing additional lines of communication both ways in fact with the police and the military then since jokowi's first term we had the office of the president's staff and the five deputies uh that office keeps changing in its function it was set up by lord panjaitan as a way of managing the coalition as well but it has more since then into various forms of think tanks and under muldoko moldoko is trying to um re-establish the power it had under lord uh but obviously he's struggling a bit with his own personal issues um at the moment so the t the two key institutions here the state secretariat and the cabinet secretary and the same was true for you the honor in fact um we're the two holders of that position where the key negotiators for the president with coalition partners for the parties um and it's very important for me i'll come to that in a second to distinguish between parties and the legislature sort of the conventional coalition of presidentialism literature would often deal with them in a package right so if presidents form coalitions with parties that would then almost automatically secure their majority uh in the parliament i argued that it's not the case in indonesia so i separated two um conceptually so the parties it's very interesting and important to talk about their weaknesses first you know it's quite astonishing that since 2004 no conventional party cadre has been competitive for the presidency right so megawati was the last chairman of an established political party who was competitive in a presidential race since then we have seen outsiders and by outsiders i mean outsiders from the established party system who typically establish personalised vehicles to facilitate the nomination that was the case um uh with uh yudiono and it's the case with pabo as as well so established parties they are really dependent on the popularity of outsiders to gain access to the powers associated with the presidency you see these days in indonesia again everybody wants to be president wyman wants to be president ulanga wants to be president wants to be president but they all have a problem and that is the lack of popularity so at the end of the day they uh have to align with somebody that can mobilize the popularity that they uh that they lack so presidents then keep parties in the coalition partly through the distribution of cabinet seats and it's quite interesting to look at how this is done there's quite a bit of literature that focuses on the inclusiveness of indonesian coalitions but there's actually a quite sophisticated key in distributing uh cabinet seats you see this here so this looks at the second uh jokowi government in 2019 and you do see that presidents make uh quite important distinctions between parties that nominated them or did not nominate them and parties that came early to the coalition or came late to the coalition so you see for instance here uh with smaller parties like pekka bay or nastem you know who hold 10 percent of the dpr seats but i have almost doubled the percentage of cabinet seats so that means it does pay off to come early in presidential nominations it's not the same you pun for instance of course as we all know was not part of this coalition um this nominating coalition in 2019 it will likely be invited now back into cabinet but uh based on this sort of um statistics here it probably will get onesie right and and not not more than that so the message coming from this statistics here and it's quite consistent over time is that nominating parties get rewarded disproportionately those parties who were not part of the nominating coalition but then joined later are getting punished and then there are of course the very few who don't join at all and don't they don't get anything um at all then of course we do have the rare occasions in which parties do get together uh to coerce the president into a particular nomination or into a particular policy uh here's the picture from 2018 where jacoby failed to get his vice presidential nomination through where the parties aligned against him and forced uh magov on him so on the one hand presidents have this tool available to them to distribute cabinet seats and parties are happily receiving that but there are rare occasions where parties form alliances against the president and then parties can be extremely powerful in that coalition as i mentioned i uh situate the parliament as a separate actor from parties i do not think that there is a direct linkage between uh the party's position in presidential coalition and the legislature so we need to look at how presidents form this you know distinct coalitions with legislators and the way this is done i can't go into details here but you know the whole chapter is about this it's essentially a system of brokerage in the parliament by which presidents form alliances with the senior leadership of uh the parliament in order to achieve uh consent towards their policies laws and especially budgets it's quite remarkable that since 2004 we have not seen for instance a single budget um in which there wasn't a consensus decision by by parliament so no walkouts no voting against budgets we have seen some votes on fuel subsidies which were related to supplementary budgets but the budget itself the goal of presidents is that every one of the legislators needs to agree and they almost always do right and the way to achieve this is that every single legislator personally needs to be bought off through a system of packed patronage and so this is where throughout this long process of budgeting in the parliament each single member of parliament gets something out of it some project that you know is being channeled back to their constituencies and so forth and the way this works is that the speaker is the chief uh broker in this regard you see here the consultative agency and the caucuses are part of the system as well the brokers below the speakers are the deputy speakers and then the chairpersons of the various committees so this is this is the flow of the brokerage if you like and it's not necessarily through the political parties with whom the president forms separate uh coalition arrangements and my case study in this chapter is of course devoted to this gentleman because he was the the chief broker of the dpr who has done it most effectively and has done it most bluntly and so it was possible for me to reconstruct how this works from his own statements in court and so forth because eventually of course he he did go to court and it's very insightful to look at his testimonies to see how parliament works and jokowi uh liked sergio novanto because of his brokerage skills right there was always this sort of mystery why jokowi was so fond of said novante that he not only approved him returning to the chair of the dpr but also made him a chairperson of golka and that's because no other person was as effective in this brokerage role as said genovanta so the president would go to him i want this law passed i want that budget passed you make it happen and said yeah would do the deals um that were necessary to achieve that not all of them illegal of course a lot of what's happening here is uh so pork barreling um trading of projects for certain parliamentarians and so forth but on the side and this is what he then went to prison for a lot of money was flowing as well into the private pockets of cetiado and his sub uh brokers one of my marcus just just uh i noticed that we're coming up to time you should try and finish within five minutes or so yeah okay um so let me just say a few words um about um how these coalitions are managed i won't be able to go into all of the details with each actor but inter intra-act competition is an organizing principle of coalition management so presidents uh not only tolerate competition between their coalition partners they in fact profit uh from it so here's one example very briefly um where you see three gentlemen here so on the uh very left uh gator the then head of the armed forces in the middle tito the head of the police and on the right um woody gunawan who was initially when jokowi came to power nominated as police chief now this was the first crisis of the jacobi presidency when he came under pressure from the police because jokowi wanted to withdraw the nomination of budigunawan as police chief and so the police was openly rebelling against this decision what did jokowi do he turned to the military for support in order to counterbalance the influence of the police so this is the way through which gaddafianto then came into the office of tni commander in fact you know through the normal procedures uh the army would have not been up for the tni headship at the time but the army was arguing to jokowi you need us now and he followed that advice so gathered was put into that position once scattered allowed jacoby to counterbalance the police tito was put in charge of the police was able to clean the ranks of the budi gunawan network so the police became a loyal jokowi supporter at which point uh gutter turned against the president and became sort of a bit of an opponent within the coalition which then led to a consolation in which jacobi used tito as the new power center of the police to counter counterbalance uh the military so intra you know group competition uh actually helps the president to keep the coalition in in balance very important in the management of uh the coalition especially the non-party actors are the interest groups yeah uh so we have corporate and began for the bureaucracy upsie up casey abkhazia for local government cutting and give me for the oligarchs and mohammed here for the muslim group so a lot of these negotiations that are occurring between presidents and these groups are occurring through these interest groups here is one of these meetings which was particularly interesting very early on in the jokowi presidency a meeting of jacobi with governors and the head of the delegation at the time was the governor of south sloisi who then said so if we can uh discuss here you know we are uh the president's biggest party the governors are the leaders of your party in uh the regions and at this occasion they ask for one trillion rupiah each for their uh provinces to call we nodded there were some deals done and of course that uh governor of uh south suday later ended up in cabinet um in his second uh second term you know official events which we often look at as some sort of boring ceremonial occasions are actually crucial for um the management of coalitions there are important events of political theater they provide the platform in which the president can express expectations towards the coalition partners and on the other side for these coalition partners to express their demands and frustration so i went through quite a lot of these speeches given at these occasions and they include very important demands and you know often lead to a recalibration of the relationship between the president and coalition partners here's jacoby for instance in one of these events a corporate event to keep the bureaucracy in line now the composition of these presidential coalitions has been relatively stable over time important actors are included not so important actors are excluded that includes the liberal groups of course over a long period of time but there has been one important uh difference between the jacobi and juliano government governments udiono included the militant islamic groups into the broader parameter of coalition of presidentialism while jokowi excluded them and ultimately um repressed them but even there jacob we recalibrated his coalition by including more of the uh mainstream muslim conservatives like army briefly to democratic decline this is all pretty obvious here you you know see how democracy slowly but steadily declined after a peak of at about 2008 and this has as i argue in the book um a clear relationship to coalitional presidentialism because coalition of presidentialism by establishing these red lines of all of the actors that are not being touched both on the side of the president and the coalition partners it weakens horizontal and vertical accountability key areas of reform are effectively turned into taboo zones and conservative values of coalition partners like the military or the muslim groups are upgraded to state values for me the tipping point in this process in which coalitional presidentialism turned from an asset of providing stability into one of of reliability in the form of stagnation and regression was 2009 with yudiono's re-election up until this point coalition of presidentialism was still sort of experimented with as you remember rydiano came in in a pretty weak position um then formed his very large coalition made it work and his re-election with the landslide victory sort of confirmed for a lot of political actors that that was a winning model of political organization and after that jokowi after initially in 2014 challenging this approach he simply adopted it for his presidency as well briefly uh why do we see this form of coalitional presidentialism in indonesia i think there are three sort of large areas we need to look at first is institutional i think the 2002 constitutional amendments were critical in producing coalitional presidentialism because it did something that very few constitutional amendment processes can do and that is increasing the powers of many actors at the same time so in this case both the president gained more powers through the popular mandate gained from a direct election and the protection from impeachment it's now near impossible for an indonesian president to be impeached it's possible but there are extremely high hurdles but at the same time the dpr and other actors also gain power so that's the first and very important one the second factor i think is experiment experiential uh ed and i uh interviewed yudiono in 2004 and it was real 2014 and it was really um astonishing how often he came back to his experience as a minister on the y and he said i see what happens to presidents that do not want to cooperate with their coalition partners i see what happens if they believe they're safe and then they fall nevertheless and this whole idea of the presidency was i need to prevent cows and the more people i integrate into my coalition uh the less cows i have again jokowi in 2014 said i'm going to change all of that but it took several weeks only for him to change his mind and to reverse back to the winning model of coalitional presidentialism that he had seen under the honor then this last fact is ideational i mean it's a factor that's easily dismissed as purely rhetorical but you do hear it quite a lot if you talk to indonesian politicians why this these big coalitions why so much cooperation they would often refer to these traditional values of corporation goten and so forth in order to defend that approach you know any speech by megawati for instance would give you some sense of that and really finally the comparative contextualization so we we have seen from the beginning that post 2004 indonesia is an example of coalition of presidentialism that sits at the very high end of both the stability and inclusiveness uh scale and it shows that coalitional presidentialism need to shift their focus a little to include the non-party and non-legislative arenas as well so that's the main focus of the book there's a lot happening in coalitional presidentialism that's not related to parties and legislatures right so that's that's how i understand the contribution to the broader debate on coalitional uh presidentialism i believe that there's a very productive way to integrate uh studies of civil military relations bureaucracy studies and other variants to be integrated into coalitional presidentialism studies and i also mentioned at the beginning you know for me the really big point to take away here is that the danger of coalitional presidentialism or presidential systems of all is no longer the issue of vulnerability instability the inability of presidents to rule effectively it's the perils of stability that we now need to talk about very finally absolutely last point um there is of course always the question from comparativists who would say well how representative is indonesia really for coalitional presidentialism that includes so many non-party actors so i've done sort of a little bit of comparison in in this regard and it turns out that actually what happens in indonesia isn't all that unusual in other countries as well so if you look at the last column here the percentage of cabinet seats held by non-party actors is actually quite high in most of the presidential systems i uh looked at right so indonesia is 55 percent kenya 57 peru 53 brazil 61 brazil this is a number of course only under bolsonaro it would have been much lower prior to him coming to power but i think the bottom line here is indonesia is as i said at the high end of stability and inclusiveness but it's in no way unusual and it doesn't exclude the possibility for us to compare indonesia productively to other countries as well thank you very much excellent thank you marcus for a fascinating presentation now just a couple of uh announcements on how we're going to do this we've got almost 130 people online uh so i expect there'll be a lot of questions um oh there's uh and some people have already expressed um written questions into the chat so we'll try and go through those but you can also indicate if you would like to ask a question just by using the raising hands function in zoom and i apologize if we don't manage to get through every one but i will try to uh obviously i would ask um people to try and keep their questions as succinct as possible you'll also note that we're recording this discussion um we won't be putting this q we normally don't put this q a session online um it's just for the benefit of the presenter to go back on later but nevertheless if you would prefer not to be recorded please just indicate that and we will um pause the um the recording um i'd also like to take this opportunity just to announce that next week we have a another seminar at the same time uh next tuesday uh jumping uh still focusing on presidents but jumping over one country looking at uh duterte and public opinion polling uh in the philippines stephen rude is making that presentation i'm all right so um let's go to the first question in uh chat i'll try and alternate um so this first question i'll read it just to get us going is from darendra wardana marcus i'm sure you can see that there so he's particularly interested uh i think it's yes darendra is especially interested um in this question about the others group in these lists of cabinet compositions uh that you you you list um uh you know people like millennials business people startups and so on can you tell us a bit more about them and their composition and their relative strength compared to other groups yeah so these are essentially the groups that are almost permanently excluded right so i think i made it clear that presidents make that choices about who is included and who is excluded based on the importance for them so they might have we talked about millennials and there would be ngos and the liberals and so forth they're all at the margins of the political system intellectually not all that important they don't have the power to seriously threaten the stability of government and therefore they're not integrated in in in the same way so that would be my very brief answer and it sort of explains as well why jokowi has paid no attention to uh the liberal margins of the political system that were so important in bringing him to power in 2014 at least they believed they were so important but you know they weren't important anymore to run government itself thanks marcus but i think the question was partly asking about that column you had in your first table of people in cabinet who were listed as other without being specific oh all right okay yes oh sorry i i thought you it was a more general question okay so the others there you have technocrats for instance right so the three milianis and so forth who are brought in for their expertise i do they have no power base they have no pressure really that they could bring to the table to coerce the president into a coalition arrangement there are simply uh experts that that the president brings in in order to run various departments that he doesn't want to give to one of the coalition partners right and and the finance ministry would be one of these one of these examples right where neutral essentially powerless person is put into this uh to this position so that's what we have in this category of the others thank you paul hutchcroft who's next on my list yes um uh excellent uh talk uh marcus a really top notch and clearly a fantastic book is on the way i have uh just two quick questions that first of all the system you describe has endured for uh 17 years but still it all uh two presidents both of whom as you pointed out are very popular as well as outsiders so how enduring do you think the system might be if a future president is unable to match the kind of sustained popularity um that have been uh evident under yuriono and jokowi uh especially given the extent to which you um give a lot of analytical weight to uh popularity the second question closely related to that is um what what do you see as prospects for reform what might disrupt this system of coalitional presidentialism uh and what specific reform measures would you see is most promising of improving the democracy and overcoming this uh thing you call the perils of stability so particularly going back to your mention in one of the final slides about the 2002 constitutional amendments uh what um if you were working with a a group of reform advocates on this what would you see as the the most important to focus upon great thank you yeah in in terms of the sustainability of of this of this system i i think you really would have to have somebody who and this sort of combines with your second question but people have to have somebody who is truly determined to stand outside of this system right then jacoby pretended to be somebody like this in 2014 this entire campaign was directed against coalitional presidentialism he said i will not be held hostage by all of these coalition partners and so forth i don't care if i only have a minority in parliament i think it's possible for me to rule in this way but at the first occasion of being challenged and that was in fact over the cabinet announcement where megawati threatened to withdraw support if a certain minister was appointed he immediately reverted back to what he found was uh jacoby's voice yudhoyono's winning formula um so so that would have to change you know that somebody comes in and finds there's more to gain from challenging this system than uh from uh cooperating with it but it's very tempting and this is you know coming to the the first question as well you were talking about the popularity the popularity i would argue of these two presidents is also not necessarily coincidental right so with jokowi in particular we have seen especially in the second period this increasing dominance of his allies over the media yeah so you know almost every one of these media oligarchs are now sitting in one capacity or another in government they decide what the population gets to hear in terms of for instance the covet response which was not stellar but still jacoby gets a 70 approval rating out of that so we are now in a situation where this coalitional presidentialism as such produces an environment in which presidents can control the political system and that con includes uh the popularity question uh as well and that's why i included the um re-election issue as an indicator of stability right because i think it's this is not happening in in the vacuum so if a president controls the coalition controls the media controls much of the political system re-election is of course much much easier so in terms of the reform again you would have to have somebody coming in um an aha figure right so who and he did exactly ark's criticism towards jacobi has always been that you know he was not prepared to go the full way that in terms of the rhetoric he would be challenging the elite but he wasn't prepared uh to take up the fight ahok did take up the fight uh ended up out of office and in prison and jakob we ended up in the second term so the temptation is very high to just keep going with the system that that we have thank you so the next question in chat i'll read it out to save time is from alex arifianto from rsis in singapore uh thanks alex um the first question is about differences and continuities with the pattern of the 1950s when rainbow coalitions were already visible so how different is the contemporary pattern to what we find back in the 1950s and the second question is a more technical one about how do you operate operationalize the concept of oligarchs in your study is it based on wealth yeah and so on yeah so 1950s obviously was a parliamentary system right so the majority in parliament decided who was prime minister and who wasn't and we saw a prime minister falling about every every year so this was a crucial difference to i mean apart from the difference between parliamentarism and presidentialism but the crucial difference was that it was so much easier to remove a prime minister than it was to remove a president today and the protections built into the post 2002 constitutional amendments around the presidency now you have to go through uh the hurdles that are built towards an impeachment are a crucial factor in creating coalitional presidentialism i think that a lot of the parties the reason we have not seen even an attempt at um impeachment is that parties realize it's pointless right they would have to jump over such a high threshold to move against the president that they don't do it i'd say and if there's no uh sort of profit to be gained from impeachment proceedings so they better cooperate right so uh this is a major driver and that wasn't present and it wasn't present before 2004 either right so the whole issue that led to the wide impeachment actually led to the 2002 amendments that then protected the president uh more strongly and and created a system in which the president is much stronger than before in terms of the oligarchs my definition of an oligarch is a political operator whose primary political capital is direct control of wealth that's my definition right so um that differs somewhat from from winters and in fact very hardis and robison they don't define oligarchs at all they define oligarchy as a system right so my definition of oligarch focuses on availability of personal wealth as the primary capital of a political act thanks the next question is from uh ben kirkfleet it's in chat but i see ben is primed and ready to go so ben do you want to ask your question in person i i just wanted to know if you'd uh run this kind of argument by the politicians who've been in the thick of it and see what their claim what you say does it resonate with their experiences and their perceptions well actually it's based on what these politicians have told me right so i didn't say much about um the sources of this book but it's basically the insiders of this system uh on which i based this account and in fact i mentioned this at the very end of the presentation their sort of justification would be ideational right so we are a society that traditionally favors uh cooperation over confrontation that goes back to goten and so forth and meghawati would still give a lot of speeches today about how she finds this idea and democracy that a majority of 50 plus one should rule over the rest totally outrageous she said we should we shouldn't have votes you know we are a society that was born out of these principles of cooperation uh and so forth of course in my view in this way i'm a political economist i think this is sort of the decoration for quite logical dynamics of coalitional presidentialism in which both partners gain a lot in the distribution of resources right and but it's it's smartly defended in an ideational way thanks uh marcus sydney jones you were next with a question or a comment perhaps on the police oh you're muted sydney you're muted sydney i got it yeah uh no it was just a a quick comment on the uh on the issue of the police in the uh in in terms of the competition among actors because it seems to me that while we're all concerned about the increasing role of both the police and the military as part of the democratic decline in fact the the police role seems to have been effectively diminished both by booty gunawan maintaining a very strong presence and control over factions within the police but also by jokowi managing to put in this loyalist as the kapolei without any basis of support as far as i can tell within the police as an institution more generally yeah so i think that's a general problem with the way presidents have tried to integrate the police and the military uh into their coalitions and it's very similar between judy ono and jokowi in fact and this is where i mentioned at the beginning the role of accidents for instance especially at the very beginning of a presidential term presidents have military and police accidents that they then send off in back into the force they become some middle range officers and at the end of a president's second term they become senior leaders of of the police right so these loyalists whether it's the accidents whether it's past palm press whether it's other forms of proximity between presidents and these offices is a major tool of integrating security agencies into the coalition but the uh implication is exactly what you mentioned that of course there are parts and and one could argue the majority of these officers who are not integrated through that mechanism right so what is integrated is the uh elite right so jokowi then you know as well then has the ability to appoint loyalists to leadership positions while the majority of the lower ranks might actually not be in support of the president and in fact this is an argument that presidents have used to argue that they do not manipulate these organizations well the document for instance has always said what are you talking about you know us putting loyalists into these key positions surveys have shown that the majority of military officers have voted for bold which they then take as evidence that their influence is not autocratic right but i think that and this is where generally a lot of the coalition building for the other actors as well you could make the same arguments for anu and other organizations where the coalition building happens at the elite level right it doesn't mean that the entire organizations are then drawn into the coalition as well thank you the next question was from daddy dinardo it's in chat but daddy are you with us do you want to ask that question directly sure thanks um so uh exxon presentation marcus uh just uh one quick questions on the potential enactment of the negative something quite similar like the previous uh that was proposed by the bambang susatio as the chair of npr so one of the idea is to shift budgetary power from president to the parliament so um at this point how significant do you think this would affect the future president's ability to accommodate the interests of oligarch because uh one point that you mentioned in your presentation is that on budgetary power president has the ability to to sort of like facilitate uh oligarch in this regard so um that's my question thank you yeah so first of all this wasn't bambang sassetius idea this was meghawati's idea and she has been talking about this for for quite some time you know this was a thing that her father um had been very strong about and it then made its way through megawati into the the npr uh interestingly jacoby when he first heard about it was uh flat out opposed to this idea because he thought that this would limit the flexibility of presidents to respond to short-term policy challenges and he has since then changed his mind right and this in itself says something about how coalitional presidentialism works you know he has made compromises and he seems now to be in support of it generally the way i've seen this formulated i don't think it actually will have much to it what you mentioned as a limitation on the budgetary powers is actually a paragraph that would say that the parliament could reject presidential budgets if they thought they were not in line with these policy guidelines but they can do this now already right so they can every single time a budget is getting to the dpr they can say no but they never do because in the process of negotiating it everyone gets something so what this new guideline would do would just be to give the dpr even a little bit more leverage to ask for more to say yes to the budget that's that's it i think i don't think it would have a great policy implication for the future thanks the next question is from uh nava nurania she has yes it's not the question in chat but an updated question thanks nova hi thanks ed uh and thanks marcus for the presentation i know you've said a few words about it at the beginning of the q a but if you could expand more on the um you know what are the limits of the uh coalitional presidentialism either in indonesia or in the literature as a whole and um like what are the patterns of of inclusion and things like that thanks yeah so i think there's a lot in flux and as i looked at the comparison you know brazil for instance is a very interesting case where prior to bolsonaro we actually had pretty stable party government there so the workers party was in power and uh cabinet seats would be largely distributed to party members and so forth but bolsonaro has completely scrambled this entire system so he now completely bypasses the parties in parliament and his governing is patching together majorities based on individual alliances with parliamentarians it's similar not the same but similar to to the philippines where parties are extremely weak and president sort of do their deals as well with individual parliament parliamentarians so so as populists become stronger over time they have an impact as well on presidentialism and it becomes more difficult in fact to see the outlines of what would have been the coalitional the conventional coalition of presidentialism and then this is my criticism towards that school that it only focuses on that area of parties and legislative interactions and i think with populists challenging these conventional structures we need to look more and more at what's happening outside of that you've seen in in my last table there's two countries where i don't have the numbers yet you know it's ukraine and bolivia where also you know this sort of uh conventional um pattern of negotiations between presidents and parties also seems to be seems to be breaking down so my prediction would be that in the future we're looking more and more at these sort of particularistic negotiations between presidents and actors that are important to their rule rather than simply looking at you know which party supports the president and which one doesn't so this leads to the next couple of questions which are both about extending your model to other places so tony reid and i'll just refer to the question asks where else would this model work and in particular why is india resistant to coalition coalitionism um and leela sari who can't ask a question because she's in that car um asks about whether you could extend this framework to the sub-national level in indonesia does this work for governors mayors and so on yeah so first on india obviously you know we have a different system right so parliamentary system versus presidentialism so this is why india doesn't feature in a lot of these studies simply on on presidentialism personally i think if if india had a presidential system and modi would have found a way around that it would work in a very in a very similar way but institutionally as comparative is we need to stay away from comparing apples and oranges and in this case it would tell us not to go into the game of uh comparing coalitional presidentialism to the parliamentarism of of india the second question about a sub-national level uh i think there are significant differences to the presidency um number one being that the issue of impeachment and so forth is very different at the local level governors parties do not have or should not have at least control over the police and the military these are all national institutions but they are that right so the biggest element i would hear where these two levels meet is the control of the bureaucracy right so i think the local government leaders make similar deals with the bureaucracy that presidents make in order to keep the bureaucracy as part of their coalitions but yeah so i think it's a very intriguing idea to extend that but you know there are there are significant um uh exceptions to that to the extension uh let me now go to colin barlow who's been waiting very patiently thank you colin yeah thanks very much marcus for an excellent talk um my question relates to the relationship between stability and regional aspects uh regional progress um indonesia of course is a very very large country the presidency is focused in jakarta i happen to have worked in musa dagar and timor for 30 years i've experienced both the suharto regime and the current circumstances to me since 2004 there's been a gigantic release of energy through ngos and other instrumentalities um which has been very important for development jakarta doesn't seem to have an enormous influence on these remote situations could you comment on that well i don't know how to comment on that other than saying that's part of the decentralization process since 2001 and so i deal in the book with parts of that in the chapter on local governments right and so the way presidents have tried to build local governments into their coalitions both through the party avenue and through the non-party avenue i mean juliano for instance um had for the very first time as his minister of the interior governor who was a non-party representative and now of course we have people like risma in government as well so this is part of trying to secure the loyalty of local government representatives towards the president in uh jakarta and we've seen this in the 2019 election when jokowi's team went around indonesia and got signatures from i think 350 parties to support his his re-election and the leverage here was often well you sign this paper and we make sure you get good allocations for your next budget and and so forth so this is what the presidents are concerned about uh primarily you know how do local government leaders feature in the defense of their political power in jakarta i think that's that's number one number two would be how do these areas relate to major infrastructure projects that presidents want to get through and then maybe number 10 number 11 would be the issue that you mentioned about ngos on the ground and sort of micro development issues so again i i would say this is not something that is on a president's mind uh every day it's it's about political loyalty and it's about macro effectiveness of the government apparatus thanks um i'm going to uh well actually in a moment i want to throw to bill little to see he's also writing a book on a topic to give him an opportunity to give some brief comments we are running out of time unfortunately we probably won't get through all the excellent questions but first i want to bundle together the next couple of questions one from how heal how is asking about what the implications of your analysis are for the formulation of high quality development policy including in terms of socioeconomic progress environmental protection and such like um and bayou kurniadi asks a similar question what's the effect of this model on effective government governance in particular jokowi often complains about his role of the chief of government being constrained by laws regulations and various other limits on his power right so again it's this payoff between stability and you know policy reform if if you like so in terms of the stability that each government needs in order to implement policies effectively that stability is there and that's what presidents have in mind if they essentially keep key actors from sabotaging their policies because they're part of the broader presidential coalition so that part of it works but the part that doesn't work is to come to policies that are not simply reflections of vested interests of the partners that are included in the the coalition i don't know i'm sure hal you would disagree with me on that but i i think the omnibus bill was a very uh good example for that you know where a lot of the oligarchs were in fact sitting on the committee of the drafting of this bill the labor unions were conveniently marginalized during the during the pandemic social mobility restrictions and and so forth so so if you look at the main outcomes of this omnibus bill you will find uh the key interests of entrepreneurs and oligarchs more more broadly i i think that that is a problem others might might disagree with that but you know generally the main problem is wherever you look you see segmental policies being made and it's the same is true for the muslim organizations right so a lot of the you you look at the undang that was recently passed so it would have been an unthinkable in the past to have such law in the first place but now anu is in the government and so they got this law as a presence so everyone gets something out of it that maintains stability but in terms of policy you know a lot of people are happy but as a sort of neutral policy producing process there are significant flaws bill i wanted to give you a chance to make some brief we are almost out of time so they'll necessarily have to be very brief and you're still on mute hello you're mute all right and i'm back right uh okay um as everybody uh i've really been fascinated by the presentation this is to me this is totally new uh marcus hasn't shared this with me before and i haven't shared much of my presidential work with him before either maybe we're sort of aware of the circling each other to see what is likely to come out of these two projects but i am delighted to be asked as you know in the in the event i am really delighted to be asked to participate in this because i now see in its broadest outlines what marcus is trying to do and i and i think uh at first look it certainly appears a that there's going to be a major contribution to the comparative presidential literature you know i also read scar neck back in the day and used it as a model once as a starting point and so forth and marcus really has has made very good use of that literature in terms of making an argument about how indonesia is the same and different and so forth so at that conceptual level it's really going to make a contribution secondly in terms of evidence and concepts that enabled us to look at evidence on the ground you know like who are the actors who are the actors on the presidential side who are the actors on the other side not just parties but really importantly non-parties and all of that looks like it's really laid out clearly and a lot of evidence provided by marcus who you know has now spent so much time in indonesia interviewing all these people that this is going to be a very rich book so so i'm really looking forward to seeing it and using it as a resource for my own work thank you bill so that looks like a very solid vote of confidence in uh marcus's uh ongoing book so look unfortunately we have come to the end of our time so i'm really sorry to the people who were next in the q where everyone else who was next in the queue i think it was meredith and uh brahmantia basuki in particular um so let's call this formal part of the event to close hang on marcus uh go ahead well so like last week i mean i'm happy to stay i was just gonna suggest that yes so for those of you who don't have to rush off and teach or go to bed for those of you are in the middle of the night please just hang on here and we can just continue the conversation informally and perhaps marcus will be able to address some of those questions we haven't uh been able to deal with so far but for those of you who do have other things to attend to thanks very much for coming we do have this seminar next week on duterte for you to remember and hopefully attend and um thank you very much marcus for a fantastic presentation all the best for your new book
EprpSaENIYg,"What about whataboutism? - Prof Ian Hall, Dr Van Jackson, Yun Jiang","The great American political scientist Seymour Lipset once said, “they that know only one country, know no countries”.

This panel addresses the issue of comparisons in our political discourse, and in particular “whataboutism” - the response China critics often make when it is pointed out that other countries have committed egregious actions similar in kind, if not scale, to China. By this, they mean that the comparison raised is a distraction from dealing with China’s actions. But this approach arguably sits uneasily with our desires to avoid double standards. This panel of experts will discuss the ethical and political aspects of “whataboutism”, with a focus on China.

(Routledge, 2021).",1,uh ladies and gentlemen everybody and everyone um my name is Greg Raymond I'm a lecturer here at the um strategic and defense studies Center at the coral Bell School of Asia Pacific affairs and on the convener of the global China research spoke uh under the auspices of its center for the China and the world and the task of the global China research spoke is to look at China's impact globally particularly at the Grassroots level uh today we're doing something a little bit different and looking at a kind of uh ethical issue I'd like to begin by acknowledging that we're meeting on the lands of the nunawal and Embry peoples and pay my respects to their Elders past present and emerging I'd like to also acknowledge uh the support of the center for China and the world and the support of the coral Bell school for putting on this event today so the topic is uh what about what about ism and uh that's quite a mouthful but we're going to try and unpack um the the perils and the benefits of uh comparison uh particularly with regards to making ethical judgments about uh the behavior of countries in the economic in the in in the global system so it was the uh American sociologist Seymour lipset who once said to know only one country is to know no countries and his point there is that we need to compare in order to acquire knowledge uh but what about when we moved to making uh I guess ethical judgments or judgments about whether or not certain actions are particularly reprehensible or just mildly or so forth and when we think about uh ellipset's injunction does that mean we should also impair compare actions like uh China's illegal territorial claims in the South China Sea with Israel's uh as far as I know equally illegal claims uh in Gaza and the West Bank should we compare Australia's immigration detention policies which have quite devastating effects with China's uh hideous Detention of uyghurs is it legitimate to compare China's theft of international property with Australia's intelligence operations in East Timor as we know occurred during the team or Gap and oil uh oil and gas treaty negotiations so we we know that we gain knowledge for comparison but do we gain a sense of where we are ethically uh there are other um axioms that we can turn to and we all know many of these or at least we do in the uh in the west uh sayings such as people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones and then speaking of stones if if people are familiar and many of us will be familiar with the Christian gospels there's a parable there where Jesus certain Nazareth happens upon a woman who's being stoned to death for some infidelity and uh he makes the the intervention by saying let they who without sin throw the first stone and then we have sayings that are simple like two wrongs don't make a right where do we come to uh when we consider all these different sort of ethical principles that we use in everyday life some of them seem to attribute equivalence to wrongdoing and uh both the actors and their accusers and so they seem to appear to call for restraint for responding in responding to infractions of what is good uh but on the other hand when we think of something like two wrong stuartmaker right it seems to be like uh that the um the the second wrong must be judged on its own merits uh it can't be allowed to go unremarked or uh unopposed simply because there were wrongs preceding it so we have these different ethical imperatives one calling for restraint the other refusing moral relativity to present recognition of rock what is wrong so these sort of Two Poles these two principles seem to be intention but also complementary but are we getting ahead of ourselves if we even think about applying these sorts of principles in the world of international politics of course the international realist view international relations realist views says that National interest is the only motivating force in international politics and the Machiavellian principles of political conduct would seem to permit immoral acts in pursuit of power perhaps sometimes in pursuit of larger Goods like peace stability and prosperity moreover if we bring in these moral and ethical codes are we discussing Universal moral and ethical codes or are they rooted in particular cultural and historical contexts such as the post-enlightenment West so big questions uh it's very lucky I'm joined by our panel of imminent and talented speakers today and let me introduce we have Professor Ian Hall who's a professor of international relations the acting director of the Griffith Asia Institute at Griffith University and he's also an academic fellow of the Australian India Institute and currently co-editor for a little bit longer I think of the Australian Journal of international affairs we also have Yoon Jiang who's the inaugural Australian Institute for international Affairs China matters fellow and prior to this she was also the co-founder and editor of the blog China nikan and is currently managing editor of the China story blog at the Australian Center for China and the world former managing editor thanks you and uh and we have also with us today van Jackson who's a political scientist former Pentagon specialist who specializes in Asia Pacific security the politics of U.S foreign policy and theory and practice of grand strategy he's currently a senior lecturer in international relations at the windy and chilly Victoria University of Wellington and a number of other titles so uh welcome to Ian Yoon and uh and and then and we're going to begin with uh some uh individual statements on some individual contributions on on the topic today of what about what about ISM and we're going to run first with Ian uh then goon uh and then van and then we'll come back for um some q a first from me and then with uh with um everybody who's joined us today so um I think that's over to you Ian brilliant thanks Greg um and thanks so much for the invitation to to talk about this so this you know this is a really important and interesting topic and you know what about ism is absolutely everywhere especially for those of us who spend too much time on Twitter uh and other kinds of social media platforms so look um I'm gonna be I'm gonna risk being really kind of pompous and high-minded um uh it has given me an opportunity to go back to my roots as an international theorist rather than uh sort of India specialist what I want to work on now so look what about ism is a um is it really firmly familiar technique all of us who have children know about what what aboutism but you do it too or he did it too or she did it too as a pretty common line that you hear from kids a lot it's also something it's a technique uh and a technique of argument that the Retro editions for hundreds of years have deplored and disparaged um and it's a you know as you rightly said the argument the two wrongs don't make a right is a familiar one to all of us but what about it and what is it then it's a way of deflecting criticism and it's disarming critics and it's very effective despite being crude but I think it's also very corrosive to political life and public debate and for those reasons it's used by authoritarian Elites to defend their positions uh their power and their ill-gotten wealth the problem with what about ISM knows that it has intuitive appeal especially for those of us as you rightly pointed out in your opening comments um it's got intuitive appeal for those of us who have brought up in a kind of Christian or post-christian understandings of morality so as you pointed out um you know Jesus comes across the woman being accused of adultery and then says let he who's without sin cast the first stone or words for that effect and so John's gospel relates that those who heard it being convicted by their conscience went out one by one beginning with the oldest even to the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there in the midst now Jesus wasn't saying you're all Hypocrites rather what he was trying to make it more General point that we're all Sinners or at least potential Sinners so we're all guilty of something or of potentially guilty of something now that point is fine from a theological point of view but I think it was also at the time and now it's politically dangerous so it's good to be modest it's good to be humble it's good to be self-aware so to be aware that we all make mistakes so that we might be prone to cupidity and so on but it has but if we take that too far especially in our public life that causes problems so the Romans didn't like this idea that we're all Sinners uh and for some good and some bad reasons as nature pointed out Jesus ideas directly challenged Roman ideas about virtue manliness heroism all the things things that we think that made Roman men rather unpleasant but we stay cherished but Jesus's teachings also challenged the Roman State well to be more precise the Roman understanding of public life which emphasizes participation in the exercise of judgment and this tension was brought into focus of course by the sack of Rome by Alaric in to m410 so apologies I said this was going to be a pompous talk so it is going to be pompous Saint Augustine tells us in the in city of God that many Chris many Romans blame the Christians and blame christianities are making the Empire weak they castigated Christian ethics not just the injunction to judge not and to prioritize Eternal salvation over worldly things but also Jesus's advice to turn the other cheek his pacifism so and it of course the pacifism combined with the view that everyone is a sinner and and we should look to our own salvation led the early Christians into to avoiding military service deprecating War but also avoiding public life in Rome and the Romans many Romans many Pagan Romans thought that this had weakened Rome itself allowing it to be overrun by the Goths now Augustine's response to all of these critics was really really important in city of God and here I'm getting back to the point about what about it okay because it's Augustine's response IT addresses precisely this question so what Augustine does in city of God is say we have to reconcile Roman conceptions of public life because we need to have some kind of order and some kind of Justice some sort of rudiments of those things to just for our own well-being um but also we have an obligation to try and reconcile that somehow with Christian ethics so famously and controversially of course Augustine tries to come up with an account of when war and killing might be just and when Christians might serve as soldiers but he also says that Christians ought to care about respublica the public thing you can't just ignore it and just sit and wait for the in the categories for the second coming in Resurrection which is what a lot of the Christians did you actually have to participate in public life and make an effort so he said yes steaks are bad right they are uh for products of greed and violence of ugly nasty men often uh and that governments are often dominated by the greedy and the violent and the history of the Roman Empire as he relates illustrates this really well yes Augustine writes what are kingdoms but gangs of criminals on a large scale what are criminal gangs but Petty kingdoms looked at one way the difference is only in scale they're both organizations created to build power and seize wealth and then Augustine tells a story it's about Alexander the Great Alexander captures a pirate and he asks him what he thinks he's doing and the pirate replies the same as youth threatening people and seizing other people's hard-earned cash but because you do it with a tiny craft says the pirate I'm called a pirate and because you have a mighty Navy you're called an emperor now Augustine doesn't recall Alexander's response to this but Augustine but Augustine makes his own he says what distinguishes government from piracy is Justice which has to be done and seem to be done it isn't always done well and it isn't always done properly but it's never going to be perfect but Augustine insists that peoples and rulers have to strive for it Christians have to play a part in trying to Define what it is uh they have to participate in public life and try and make some sort of imperfect Justice work in the here and now and they have an obligation to do that so they even if you reject all of these Christian ethics even if you're a reject Augustine's argument there are still some good reasons I think to take these arguments seriously because it if as as and here again apologies for the pomposity so if it's all well made very clear being fatalistic throwing our hands up in despair being a realist opting out of politics all of those things are as a direct route to The Establishment and maintenance of tyranny and exploitation and aspiring tyrants and Pirates know that fully well this was one of the core messages of 1984 a book that wasn't really an attack on communism but on the kinds of they're all as bad as each other thinking the kind of realism that we saw in the 1930s and 40s the kind of ideas that were pushed by people like James Burnham that famous sort of EX Trotsky Island became a hardcore uh realist and then neo-conservative later on and that flourishes today so all that attacks are familiar but pernicious idea that there's always an elite that exploits us there is an iron law of oligarchy is Burnham termed it and which a concept that Orwell appropriates there's always an elite that's going to rule over and exploit the masses the new boss will always be just as bad as the oak he pointed out oh well as well Orwell pointed out too the object of propaganda is not to get people to believe in something rather to disbelieve and just trust everything even when it was obvious and right in front of you the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears it was their final most essential command is the line that we all know from 1984. it's not money or armies or secret police that ensures that oligarchs are self-interested the self-aggrandizing Dominate and exploit us it's rather apathy fatalism and disaffection so what about autism plays a really important role in doing bringing about that sort of situation um in what old-fashioned academics used to call the collective demoralization of the masses so few if any contemporary tyrants or aspiring tyrants have any kind of alternative worldview to which to which to inspire their followers or Justify their actions instead when they're criticized what they do is point to the past or present crimes as a Critic so China's responses to Western critiques so its actions with the uyghurs the classics of this genre point to the concentration camps and Beijing points back at Guantanamo such as genocide and Beijing queries the fate of Native Americans the message isn't just people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones it runs much deeper and nastier it's this when you had power you killed and you maimed and exploited now we have power and you can't criticize us for doing the same thing so if you we you if we want a colonial Empire we'll have one if we want to assert our ideological or racial superiority we will do it it is our time and it's your time to shut up stop resisting and accept our domination or else so what about is there isn't sort of smart or cute or charming not that it's particularly Charming in five-year-olds either but it's not particularly cute or smart or charming it's intentionally destructive and it's demoralizing it attempts at creating the ideal circumstances for tyranny and exploitation which is why tyrants are really keen on it and why they promote it so none of this is to say that we shouldn't be frank or honest or about our own present or past conduct we shouldn't condone hypocrisy we shouldn't pretend that we're prone to avarice um that we're not prone to avarice we should do all of those things but just as importantly we can do those things without throwing our hands in the air declaring that everything is corrupt declaring that the strong will just do whatever they wish whenever they will they'll want to do it and there's nothing we can do about it so we can do those things all those good things without indulging in what about Islam here let me go back to Orwell and then let me because I'm still being pompous uh or else she was surely right murder is just murder regardless of who doesn't whether they're left they're right they're American or Chinese it doesn't matter it's still murder we can surely be sufficiently sophisticated that murders can't be excused on the grounds that others have committed similar crimes recently or in the distant past so thanks Greg you've given me a great opportunity not just to be pompous but to rent for 10 minutes and I really appreciate that thank you thanks Ian I'm so glad we've given you a chance to go back to your roots because that was a tour de force um may I now introduced uh Jung to make some comments on the topic of what about ism before uh I guess a philosophical and Theological Overlook of what the baptism uh uh of course there is also similar Parables I believe in taoism um as well but I know that uh we have a people in the audience who are much well more equipped than me to talk about these issues um so I am also on the Unseen land of the normal and number people uh because I am um uh near AMU in Canberra as well um my focus of the talk is um slightly different it's not about uh focus is not really on government but um uh researchers Scholars uh um individuals when they deploy what a baptism so uh though what about so and so I think it's a tactic that is used across different political spectrums it's not just used by authoritarian countries um or it's used by a lot of people with different political backgrounds and leanings um into in case of a Chinese government well-known example you know one point out China's human rights recording places such as xinjiang the Chinese government likes to respond with oh what about racism and gun violence in the United States that's a pretty uh common one from the Chinese government um another individual level for people such as myself and when I say people suggesting myself I'm talking particularly about Chinese Australians when we talk when we point out some of the negative experiences we have experienced in Australia including about racism there are people who then respond with well what about China there's racism in China too in both cases as Ian has pointed out what aboutism is used to deflect any criticisms I think the logic behind that is that you should not criticize the action of a government if your government is also bad what your government is what the people who make this statement perceive what your government is so it seems to stem from this attitude that you must pick a team it's either your team or my team and if your team has done some wrong things then you cannot criticize anyone else so in the first example I talked about someone who perhaps is a bit sympathetic towards a Chinese government's actions May believe that the other person is on the Team USA and therefore they can never admit that the USA has government has done anything wrong and in the second example the person who perhaps don't want to talk about racism in Australia May believe that the other person is on team China and therefore they would not criticize anything about China okay so those people who use what aboutism to deflect criticism they appear to believe that it's not possible to be consistent on principles that is it's not possible for either both countries to be wrong or both countries to be right and that governments should just naturally do better anyway instead the what about them what encourages I think is a race to the bottom what is saying is that wrongful actions by one particular party then justifies wrongful actions by all parties um but instead you probably think about like this what aboutism is can be used positively as well it's not necessarily a negative thing it is negative when it's used to like criticisms but we can use the positively positively by saying well what about other countries that's doing better things than us we should do them as well um that has also happened throughout history in governments uh um you know throughout for example in self-strengthening movement and other in other movements in other countries where countries look to other countries that are more advanced them and say well what about those countries that's doing better perhaps we should learn from them so these strategies of learning from others is the the positive side of water baptism so coming back to you know Scholars and researchers and people like uh perhaps people in the audience people like that tend to think do tend to think comparatively I think so they can pair and contrast the similarities and differences between countries and I think that is a good thing to do when thinking about issues it allows us to see the big picture the systematic problems that we would otherwise Miss if we focus only on one country so if for example if we only focus on oppression Muslims in China then we miss how that can be linked to The Wider issues of colonialism um and and the anti-terrorism discourse have come in the West um so by thinking and comparing and contrast we can then see a big picture but of course things like existence guantano Bay does not justify um China's policies in xinjiang vice versa it's not used as a way to it shouldn't it should not be used as a way to justify wrongful actions there's a way to see the big picture and now things like technological surveillance and censorship a lot of discussion has been focused only on China but we know that even democracies um use a lot of similar tactics and use similar Technologies for surveillance purposes again democracy is using these Technologies and tactics should not be used to justify China's actions or vice versa but it is to see that the issue is bigger than just China if we see xinjiang you know impression against Muslims or technology or censorship as purely issues unique to China then there is uh that we could be misled into thinking that well clearly the only way to solve this problem is to just get rid of the Chinese government and that everything will be better the world will be a better place so we should all just hold hands and dance in circles but that's not true there are a lot of other issues involved when to think deeply and what also does is that he cuts the Chinese government as uniquely evil while absorbing actions of other governments as well so that is um the that is the downside of um only focusing on one government um and not the I guess the world as um as a uh you know analysis um the solution toward the baptism I think as I mentioned before is that one it is okay to acknowledge that more than one party can be wrong I think that should be a very simple thing to do for most people uh unless you're very uh Ultra Nationalist and who believes that whatever your government is doing is always right and other government is always wrong um I think we most people here can probably acknowledge that no governments can be wrong or even our government can be wrong um and the one government doing wrong does not justify other governments doing the wrong thing either and we should you know all strive to do better rather than race to the bottom which is what um what aboutism enables I wanted to briefly talk a little bit about the right question of whether it is possible to be consistent about values and about human rights um do we care more about human rights in say China than other countries so there are a few arguments about why we may be more con we should be more concerned about human rights in China uh than Elsewhere for one China is a big and powerful country so what does has more influence on the world than the smaller countries um for example maybe Saudi Arabia what it does maybe have a small influence on the book there's also an argument that China is an authoritarian country and we should be more concerned about bad behaviors by authoritarian countries than bad behaviors by democracies um I think that comes from the sense that even if U.S uh used um uh you know use foreign appearance to control the politics in other countries at least it's democracy um and the outcome will be less bad that if China was used for an interference to control other countries but um I don't really buy that argument because it's things to be a case that we expect highest than the behavior Italian countries than democracies which I I think he's uh probably not something we should be doing if anything because we should expect a better standard behavior from people democracies if if not equal standard Behavior um but the fact of matter is um you know right now um a lot of countries see China as an adversary so they are more willing to criticize China than to criticize I'm a lot of countries that are perhaps that are geopolitical allies um so here you can see that um I think you know realism hard power politics uh does play a big role in determining whether country is criticizing other countries human rights or values um that's it thank you so much you and that's um a great set of points and uh I think you're spot on in saying that uh um moral morality is used uh in accordance with certain sets of Interest judgments and um that's that's a that's certainly a valid observation now can I turn to uvan and uh hear what things look like from Across The Tasman Strait yeah man thanks for having me this is uh unusually it's an unusual conversation but one that's unusual in a good way um I mean obviously what about ism is about comparison and the question is what kinds of comparisons are reasonable and relevant to make and in that context I just want to make two points and then I'll unpack what I mean by each the first is that analysis and critique it does political work even when it presents as not doing political work right the second point is that if you criticize China in a manner that is a historical or that doesn't permit comparisons your analysis is going to suffer like what you think and what you have to say will be distorted so on the first point analysis does political work if if you're a consumer of analysis or a consumer of expert opinions everyone here obviously is it's important to be sensitive to the political implications of the information that you're absorbing right and by that I kind of mean you have to ask the question Qui Bono like whose agenda does this critique or analysis benefit right and you have to ask that question not as a way of invalidating the information but as a way of conditioning how you understand what's happening right why that information is even coming at you right and there's a good example is you know xinjiang in China right there's a ton of evidence that China's engaged in what both reasonable and unreasonable people would call a cultural genocide in xinjiang and that evidence exists no matter how it's presented right but whether we label it a genocide a that's its own debate and then B you know the meaning of the evidence itself is completely up for grabs right the so what or the okay what do we do that's up for framing so in the context of a conversation about uyghur genocide I've had people say to me like yeah well the US government genocided the Native American population 200 years ago and okay true enough like that's not incorrect but it's decontextualized information for one and two it doesn't change what's happening now in xinjiang right so why would you bring up that kind of comparison well that's what we would call a tanky or a Campus View right a tanky brings brings up a comparison like that the double standard critique to serve a notionally anti-imperial political project that cares only about taking down American imperialism and not anyone else's imperialism right and you know mercifully tankies are rare except on Twitter um but the opposite problem is actually way more common right if you're a pundit or a politician making a lot of noise about genocide in uh xinjiang right on the surface it's because you're outraged at the Injustice right and for some people that's all it is okay but that also that accusation also happens to be one piece of a narrative puzzle that reactionaries and neo-fascists have been assembling to advance a clash of civilizations political project in the west right one of the ways you know that's what they're doing is because it's the same people in the National Security State during the Trump years who were consolidating political power by presenting China as a super villain who were also literally supporting Chinese oppression of the uyghurs during the war on terror years right so if uyghur human rights is the true motivation of the reactionaries then they wouldn't have been complicit in violating weaker human rights the entire first decade of the 21st century man you know so the U.S helped China build a surveillance state in xinjiang and then it's outrageous only now like no no so the standard of drawing relevant reasonable comparisons makes visible the politics of analysis here right um is comparing uyghur genocide to what the U.S did over a hundred years ago is that a relevant and reasonable comparison it depends on how you do it and what you're trying to accomplish but not really right the entire world system was different then right but even if you can make a case for why it's a relevant comparison the political purpose that's going on there is not reasonable right why because whitewashing cultural genocide is not a legitimate purpose right that's not okay now and then on the other side is it relevant and reasonable to compare how a given class of people evaluate Chinese human rights violations now compared to how they evaluated it you know 10 to 15 years ago and like obviously yes obviously right it's relevant because it's the same political and social milieu right some of the exact same people Mike Pompeo right it holds constant across comparisons the thing that we're analyzing which is Chinese treatment of uyghurs and then you know maybe most important it's the same reactionary project across time great power rivalry is an evolution from the war on terror it was going to happen before the war on terror sidetracked us right so going from one construct to the other is a consistent story of militarism at the expense of democracy and you cannot tell that story unless you can make that comparison right so having said all that my point is just that it's really important to be sensitive to the political implications of analysis because being conscious about the politics of critique makes you more measured less hyperbolic more nuanced right and that brings me to my second point which very briefly is that if you view China in a present test a historical decontextualized way you're going to end up with bad analysis overall like Greg started out this panel with a quote from Seymour lipset which was on the money right comparison if it's relevant and reasonable gives our judgments a sense of proportionality and potentially validity you know it's a check against both threat inflation and threat deflation so you take the example of like uh the pla Navy or pla Air Force routinely violates the adiz uh the air defense identification zones of Japan and Taiwan right that sounds menacing you know but as it happens countries violate each other's agencies sometimes right the US does it sometimes and an aid is violation has not ever triggered a war knock on wood right so the fact of Ada's incursions without authorization is not so weird right it's certainly not something to be afraid of but the frequency of the pla ages incursions is you know if not unsettling it's at least begging for an explanation because it's abnormal right and it's been escalating for the past decade but if you just decontextualize what's happening there the aid is violations it's very easy and the media does do this to paint a picture that makes it look like China is about to launch an aerial invasion of Taiwan every day right every just any minute now it's going to happen right similarly the past couple years there's been a huge threat discourse build up around China seeking a sphere of influence in Asia and the Pacific that directly challenges this abstract thing we call the rules-based order why because spheres of influence are built out of practices of control and exclusion that circumscribe sovereignty on paper at least rules-based order is supposed to preserve sovereignty right so there's a conflict there now there's a strong case to be made that China is doing this I've made that case myself actually or they're trying to build a sphere of influence right and I have kind of a problem with that because I have a principled objection to sphere of influence Arrangements your mileage may vary but my enthusiasm for fear-mongering about a Chinese sphere of influence and getting freaked out about it it's tempered by the fact that I'm an expert at spheres of influence I have comparative knowledge of the subject right and I know that the U.S maintains a sphere of influence in the Pacific that it doesn't acknowledge it has a formal official very real sphere of influence that allows for the U.S to exclusionarily control the National Security fate of Guam American Samoa Palau the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Flippin Islands by treaty and that's only just the official sphere of influence informal spheres of influence it's like a whole other conversation right so the sphere of influence construct cannot be as menacing as some of us say if we're fighting to preserve one ourselves in the Pacific there's something else going on there right so comparison is what allows you to test whether you're applying principles consistently right because if you're not then you're misestimating both the nature of the problem that you think you're facing and what ought to be done about it you know so all I'm saying is like be aware of the politics of analysis and be aware that any analyst or a pundit that uses what a baptism to deflect comparison or to decontextualized information they run a high risk of distorting the very thing that they're trying to talk about or promote um so I'll leave it there thank you thank you van that's a really terrific set of points and I think it's um absolutely spot on uh to say that without comparison uh things can seem much more menacing and I think that somehow um is a kind of uh rebuttal to um seeing what about ISM as a as a unadulterated ill and perhaps it has some benefits now I want to turn to asking the panelists some individual questions and uh I want to begin with Ian and uh just a question about whether or not we have uh some institutional blinkers on making comparisons and uh here I'm I'm thinking about Australia um the fact that we're in a very close alliance with the United States and whether or not that means that we can't do the sorts of uh comparisons um uh and whether or not this is a good thing and I here I I would cite that in 2016 the former achieve the Australian Defense Force Angus Houston said about anzas that we should begin by cutting the talk about recalibrating the alliance and he seemed to be saying that we can't um uh undertake critical interrogation of the alliance so when we're in Alliance does this constrain governments and their bureaucracies from conducting honest appraisals or or comparisons of international conduct we're walking our thoughts on that question and thanks Craig that's yeah no look that's a really interesting question maybe I can if you don't mind maybe just move the frame slightly outwards in all of this there's we frequently pick up on I think in sort of public discourse about foreign policy it's often commented upon that you know Australia might criticize country X but not criticize country Y and Country Z and so on and then and you know in one sense that's kind of a you might say well that's that's a it's a cheap shot or that you know we might then conclude that Australia will criticize the weak but not the strong or there might be some other kind of motive going on there but we do need to acknowledge I think pretty clearly that in foreign policy we don't necessarily call out everybody all the time uh for things that they do so we might we and we can have a legitimate debate about the appropriate NASA or otherwise a foreign Minister's statement on um I don't know something like the January 6th incidents in in the United States we know should the Australian foreign Ministry have commented on that called for calm you know uh argue for an orderly transition of governments you know there was a debate around the time um precisely about that and that's where we kind of I think as a as a country uh as governments do get themselves into some trouble in the sense that you know we we will we do we don't necessarily have very clear guidelines or very clear principles involved in you know in the countries in the the incidents that we will call out from the incidents that we won't call out from the context in which that those sorts of things happen and it's into that space then that's one of the spaces in which what a battery tends to start to to flourish uh and in which accusations of hypocrisy in particular um become very prominent and so um I don't really have a very clear answer to your question but I I mean I think I I will absolutely acknowledge that there is there's a deep difficulty here uh you know in terms of you know when when do we speak out publicly on something and when do we not and I speak here from sort of personal experience you know I work on India what happens some things that happen in India are not good politically morally in terms of the people and so on would I like the Australian government to speak on some of those issues yes sometimes I would um would it be helpful for them to speak on every issue probably not but then we're getting into the murky area of which principles are we applying and which are we not yeah thanks Ian I think it is a tough question I think sometimes it is very contextual and uh in Thailand they have a saying called galatessa which basically means you've got to choose the timing and the place for any particular communication so perhaps that's uh something which is relevant here you and Can I Turn to You and I want to ask you um we hear a lot about the Chinese Communist Party well we've heard a lot more in recent years we didn't hear it for all of the Howard era because we were making lots of money in Australia but suddenly after 2016 things changed and we heard a lot more about the Chinese Communist party now we know that in the she era that um a very interesting apparatus in the Chinese Communist Party the united front work department has become re-energized and it has a very um you know political goal this this department the ufwd it aims at rallying all those who can be round valid uniting with all of those who can be United as a way of isolating Chinese Communist Party enemies so how do we take into account in some ways that China's united front work is advantaged by people who ask the sorts of what about questions that that uh that we're asking today um many many scholars of China assess that China would like to split Australia away from its alliance with the United States so does this mean that if we're objective if we're too even-handed we're actually risking assisting China's goals and risking you know becoming useful idiots in doing party work I invite your response what an excellent excellent question it actually goes to really the heart of what does it mean to be a academic scholar or researcher or Think Tank animals what role should they play um in public schools in influencing the government um so they are where what are we talking about here are people who don't work in the government people work in the government you know different categories so people you know Scholars and researchers the people here um people in the audience um what sort of role should they play is it to advance a particular country's National interest so for example should the role of an academic scholar to advance Australia's national interest no matter whether I mean you know in Australian universities that we have academics from all around the world not all academics are even Australians so do we expect all Australian academies to advance Australia's national interests or do we not um similarly the question can be posed for Think Tank analysts as well and then even one from that even if that was the case even if the case was to advance National initial particular country who gets to Define what is Australia's national interest and if it's a government's day then is the role of the academic scholar or research or think analyst Think Tank analysts to advance Australian government's priorities um no the answer is very simple when I was in the government answer was very simple when you're in the government your job is to advance the government's priorities so while the government priorities the however they Define it your role is to make it happen to advance it but now I'm outside the government and that is a bit more difficult question to answer um is your job to advance Australia's national interest or to um provide objective even kind of analysis um to me I think uh for most people the role should be the latter it should be to provide objective um analysis that can then in the result maybe to inform policy but that should not be the uh the the top priority for researchers of course if you're working on the institution and the organization there was there's always funding issues right um whether how you get uh funding for your research whether it's through government grant or through um another uh country uh that can then result in the influencing the direction of your research even if not the outcome but the direction of the research um so that is uh that is the issue we had to Grapple with as an open country as a democracy um in authoritarian countries uh that's probably not the issue you really need to think a lot about because you know especially as you mentioned under she's China um which is increasingly authoritarian um academic freedom is increasingly restricted um and the Chinese government does expect these Scholars to serve the country and serve the party but I would hope uh in Australia's case and I think it is different um we should not be expecting the same from our Scholars which this means then that there will be people there will always be people what other people will call parroting ccp's lying or seeing from ccp's songbook but that does not necessarily mean they're wrong just because they happen to agree with a particular government's policies or stance or rhetoric does not necessarily mean that they must be done wrong um you know I mean the Chinese government probably say a lot of uh little things I mean if they say the sky is blue it doesn't mean the sky is unnecessary not blue no for example so um and and in another case when we talk about especially about what baptism you know when the the CCP criticized races among imperialism in Western countries that does not mean that we shouldn't immediately stop criticizing racism on imperialism just because they may support activities course to always oppose whatever the city is the Chinese Communist Party supports that is very uh reactive um it basically means that the Chinese government and the Communist party sets agenda and you just have to always oppose that I think that's a very reactive thing instead we should think about what is our priorities um and for people in government what is our national interest thank you you know I think it comes back to that question about are there is do principles exist apart from political agendas um all right um then and can I turn to you and um I want to um uh lift a quote from a review of a book um that uh you recently wrote and in this book review um you you wrote The Following unless our response to China centers our political values we risk aligning our actions with those who oppose democracy be it China or the reactionary forces in our midst I'm just wondering if you can um explain a bit more about what you meant when you wrote this and what what it applies for a what it implies for a comparative approach to International politics yeah I mean so if at bottom the the principle that we claim to defend ties Back To Human Freedom right however you want to phrase that or cash that out then we cannot violate and compromise and trade away human freedom in order to Smite our enemy right the ends justifies the means that that cliche is a cliche right and it masks the truth and the truth is that the ends is fuzzy opaque  most of the time and the means expose what we actually value regardless of what we say so the Communist Party of China is a problem in my view and as an analyst right or and as a political partisan too I guess uh it's a problem because of its ethnonationalism because of its role propagating oligarchy because it facilitates human oppression which is even going Beyond its own borders right and so the solution to that cannot be for us to engage in various forms of human oppression in kind okay it cannot be giving unchecked power to the national security surveillance state it cannot be lining up with dictators in neo-fascists and kleptocrats across Asia it cannot be stoking racist violence at home and abroad right the solution cannot be enlisting five eyes in a clash of civilizations that pays off for fascists and rich people and nobody else man and so what I was getting at in the book review I got a little heated there um was about China's relations in the Pacific at in that moment where the context that I was writing it in and what I was trying to say was that like centering in our state craft in our foreign policy a principle of human Freedom or democracy or even just least harm is the only way that I can see to guard against us being a threat to human freedom and I'm reading that very explicitly off like it's one giant book review version of a subtweet of the Trump Administration in that moment because they were using great power competition to aggregate political power on behalf of a very anti-liberal anti-democratic milieu in the United States right so it's like you're they're using things about the regime in China that are true then they're amplifying it and then they're selling it around everywhere and they're using that to basically become fascists right so if the fascism if for lack of a better phrase is the thing that you sort of worry about with China becoming that yourself is self-def like what's what's the point of all this right so that's what I mean by like centering our political values [Music] yeah um and I think it you know by interpreting correctly you're saying let's not do um what was done in the Cold War where um authoritarian governments are very much supported unless as long as our our authoritarian governments um but this this leads me to a very similar question about these sorts of reactions to to China's um defects and and and the aspects which we need to oppose about China and what it does to the countries that are doing the opposing and and whether or not we can preserve freedom and values and so Ian I want to ask you you know in Australia that the China debate of course as we all know has been quite heated and poisonous at times and some of you know we know some Chinese Australians have started to feel uh you know victimized about that um so you know the question is are we in Australia in a time where we can still talk about the relative merits and flaws of all great powers or we are are we in danger of sliding into a public discourse where asking these questions is to risk be labeled um disloyal are we heading do you think to a more dichotomous world of you're either for us or a Guinness or have we still got middle ground and still time to sort of debate these questions clearly we are today so thankfully that's that's um not um that future is not upon us but is it getting closer thanks Craig um look I I think I think we have to have you know look this is kind of partly a scale issue okay so in in relatively small countries there are kind of incentives for everybody to try to rub along as best they can and you end up with sometimes a consensus emerging which is not necessarily always particularly healthy the bigger the country either bigger the debates the bigger the resources are for for either side or all sides uh to draw on sometimes it becomes a little less a little less uh kind of bloodthirsty and nasty and it's because it's not a zero-sum game anymore Australia's kind of in that in that sort of strange Zone where it's not quite big enough and it's not quite small enough to have really serious and healthy debates about these kinds of topics but I think it really needs to I think the the question of how to respond to China and China's behavior in the region and so on let I think let's face it has been actually quite helpful to Australia in lots of ways let me even in the even when we are accused for example even when the light of global times has shown Upon Our Own Colonial genocides and so on the good thing it means that we have to face up to the fact that what went on in the 19th century and into the 20th century and what goes on today in terms of our treatment of indigenous peoples it has to be answered there has to be a public answer given for what has occurred and what is occurring in Australia and I think that's a healthy and good and positive thing so you know what a battery in that sense can can can actually produce um some potentially some good positive and strong outcomes I recognize though the discussions that we've had are bruising and they will continue to be bruising but I think in the end you know I'm sorry to like as we started what you actually started I'll point the finger at you with uh with you know Jesus coming across the woman accused of adultery and so on I still think though that we've got to try and to you know love The Sinner and hate the sin if people are presenting bad arguments we need to point out their bad arguments that doesn't mean to say that that person presenting that bad argument is a bad person we can still recognize them for for what they are which is often the case a really well respected solid strong well-informed uh scholar or analyst or whatever else that person is if they put a bad argument I think we have an obligation to point out it's a bad argument and I think that advances things I don't think that's something which necessarily um poisons the atmosphere or shuts down debates and so on perfect it sort of reminds me of something I heard the Archbishop of Canterbury say yesterday since we're talking about Christians he said oh we have to learn to disagree well and I think um that's true disagreeing well is important can I thank you Ian uh the the great contributions then for come for for giving us a very fresh perspective and you uh for for giving us some really excellent points and thanks everyone uh for listening in and uh and and for bearing with us despite our problems with the right Zoom address which I'm glad to see that we got it all right and everyone participated in this conversation which I think is an important one so uh thank you all and we'll make this available as a recording in case you want to hear any of it later thanks bye-bye thanks so much bye-bye thank you see you
A-hgJQwGFRQ,What’s at Stake in the Indo-Asia-Pacific: Strategic Imaginaries in Geopolitics,"The contemporary struggle in Asia is as much about competing strategic ‘imaginaries’ as it is about military or economic power. At the annual Yale-NUS Global Affairs Lecture held on 7 February 2022, Shedden Professor of Strategic Policy Studies at The Australian National University Evelyn Goh analysed how key states in the region are renewing geopolitical competition through the three main competing strategic imaginaries of Asia today: the ‘Asia-Pacific’; a revived ‘Greater Asia’ made possible by China’s resurgence; and the ‘Indo-Pacific’ visions. The Yale-NUS Global Affairs Lecture is sponsored by the late Professor Saw Swee Hock.",1,good evening let's take your seats good evening my name is chen haong and i'm assistant professor of political science and head of studies for global affairs here at tlnus college it is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the fourth annual yale nus lecture on global affairs i'm particularly excited to see an in-person audience from the college and as well as from the broader nus community as well as a large presence of parents alumni and many of the college's supporters joining us virtually from all corners of singapore and from around the world the yale and us lecture on global affairs is supported by the late professor saw sweethawk professor saw envisioned this lecture series as a way for the college to fulfill its mission of redefining liberal arts education for an increasingly complex world especially as our students explore questions pertaining to globalization and human interconnectedness this evening we're particularly delighted and honored to have professor evelyn go the shedding professor of strategic policy studies at the australian national university to deliver this year's annual lecture to share her insights on the strategic imaginaries in geopolitics what that means what it entails and what are the implications as the region emerges as a new center of gravity with increasing strategic importance for global trade commerce and security professor go will identify and explain what this all means what's at stake for us here in the indo-asia-pacific professor go is a highly sought-after well-established and leading scholar of asian security and international relations theory and practice she is a director of research at the strategic and defense study center the convener of the women in international security initiative and the convener of the graduate research and development network on asian security all at the australian national university her accolades are long and many i won't list them all but above all else she is a wonderful wonderful friend and colleague and a long time supporter for many of us here at the college after professor go's lecture professor naoko shimatsu professor of history here at yala news college will join the stage to continue the conversation and to moderate the q a professor shimatsu is a renowned global historian of asia with research expertise and the cultural history of international diplomacy professor shimatsu is a fellow of the royal historical society and leads the inter-asia engagements research cluster at the asia research institute before we proceed just a couple of final administrative announcements to share with one and all first we request that you do not take photos videos screenshots or recordings of tonight's session as tempting as that may be second we welcome audience interactions and questions from those joining us live in person and in person during the q a

your questions into the q a function at the bottom of the screen and for those watching on facebook you can type your questions directly in the comments section with that said please join me in giving a very very warm yale annual welcome to professor evelin go [Applause] thank you so much um professor chen hao huang and colleagues at ulnus thank you so much for this invitation to be here with you this evening it's a real pleasure to be back in singapore i've been saying to friends here in person tonight that it's a wonderful liberation to get out of australia the island this is my first trip out of australia into in two years and i'm terribly excited there is a sense of excitement here um in the in-person audience as well i get that this is still quite an unusual setting to to for us to be able to get together in person even in singapore so thank you very much for those of you who've joined us this evening whether in person or on the various online formats i've been asked to speak for 25 minutes which i'm going to try to keep myself too so i'm going to jump into this without too much preamble it's an interesting time to be talking about what we think might be at stake in what i'm calling the indo-asia pacific and it's particularly exciting time to inject into the debate a reminder that geopolitics is not simply about projections of military power or projections of economic might um but there are that there is there exists beneath those exercises of projection of power acts of strategic imagination as well right um and so that's what i'm going to try to spend my short amount of time with you this evening delving a little bit into let me lay my cards on the table this is where what i'm going to try to persuade you about now while most of the debates that we hear about today um whether it's about the asia pacific or the indo-pacific or other terms which we'll come to in a moment most of the debates center on great power rivalries they center on a contest for supremacy which many observers quite rightly point out is underway in the region that we live and work in i don't disagree with that but i do want to add the reminder that the contemporary struggle is just as much about competing strategic imaginaries as it is about military or economic power geopolitics you know we hear a lot about the revival of geopolitics geopolitics after all i would argue is a way of looking at the world it's a way of considering the links between political power geography and cultural diversity right and in essence it's about the connections how we think about the connections between these three elements of geography political power and cultural diversity geopolitics therefore involves us having to imagine and to prioritize some forms of connectivity all right which parts of the world which communities whom do we think are connected to each other in a way that is more important than the ways in which they are connected with other parts of the world or with other communities right it's a form of prioritizing connections to create what benedict anderson called an imagined community right if we take into account space and place in any real sense we get very quickly to that fundamental act of prioritizing connectivities so that's what i'm going to try to sort of persuade you about this evening that act of imagining and then bringing into fruition you know through action and through policies the prioritization of some connectivities the prioritization of some identifications with particular parts of the world in particular communities and through that i'd like to persuade you that your political competition is grounded in a contest over which imagined connected community is more important right so that's what i'm going to try to do in this short amount of time i have i'm going to do this by looking in turn at what i regard to be the three large competing strategic imaginaries in our region today two of them have pretty obvious labels one of them doesn't and it's the middle one that i've had to temporarily impart and label to this is necessary necessarily in evolution so please bear with me i'm going to speak and turn about the asia pacific with which we ought to be most familiar then i'm going to talk about something i'm calling greater asia or eurasia revived and then i'm going to segue into the indo-pacific about which we hear a great deal today now let's jump into this so let's consider the first strategic imaginary that i'd like you to think about to to think about for for a few minutes with me um you know the asia pacific for most of us who worked on this open region is probably best encapsulated by the policy reality if you like right of united states strategic projection into what they call the western pacific and what we call asia and this is the old u.s pacom pacific command map which very nicely encapsulates in in a map format what we used to think about when we said asia pacific right both sides of the pacific ocean encompassing north east south east asia oceania as well as north and south america on the other side of the pacific so that sense of the spanning of the two sides of the pacific ocean now of course so many of us who've worked on this part of the world have lapsed into the sense of taking this for granted right and over time we've perhaps myself included sort of forgotten the degree of a strategic imagination and be devotion of resources right that's been necessary over a matter of a hundred years or so to make this meta region that we call the asia pacific a reality right a good reminder of that is when you try to look at the standard mercator projection of a map and you realize that you actually got to cut the map you know and then rejoin it in order to put both sides of the pacific ocean on one sheet of paper right in in a 2d in in a 2d format like this right with the cut so another way to think about this to emphasize that sheer act of power projection that's been necessary to you know to forge connectivities across the asia across the pacific ocean um one way i'd like to illustrate this when i teach i like to illustrate this when i teach is is through this set of figures just bear with me if we think about the sheer amount of resources that that have been necessary um we could think we can stick with sort of military resources as we often start with now the red stars on that map indicate the two ports that i'd like you to take as your reference points hainan on the the asian side of the map and san diego on the americas side of the map on the eastern side of the pacific those are two red stars and the other blue stars are the ports indicated on the table in the middle variously in asia and oceania if you look at the sailing distances right to get from san diego to yokohama jakarta sydney or guam you compare them with the sailing distances to get from hanan to the same port you get a sense of the sheer exponential differences there are for an offshore power from the other side of the pacific like the united states to project right either in commercial terms well these are sailing distances not just for warships or in military terms right so this thing that we take for granted that connectivity across the pacific ocean is not um in in in many ways um at all to be taken for granted and rests on significant commitments of technology resources etc of course we are also aware that the asia-pacific incumbent region is one that has enormous economic activity at its basis underpinned by a great deal of economic interchange and activity again for those of us who are international political economists or international relations scholars you know um we would be very familiar with something like the asia-pacific economic grouping which was brought into um effect in the early 2000s late 1990s again formally bringing together the markets of asia and the americas um forging again these concrete um connectivities of trade investment assets etc across both sides of the pacific so what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a great deal of fleshing out and a great deal of reality in the asia pacific imaginary right it's that this is in many ways the incumbent imaginary to beat simply because it's had it's it's got that degree of substantive substantiation whether we think about exchanges of people exchanges of goods financial flows projection of military power and otherwise of course it's not an uncontested imaginary this is also important to to to remember prior to the contemporary debates that we pay a great deal of attention to we've already seen contestation against the dominant asia-pacific imaginary coming in the form of ideas of you know exclusive regionalism within the east asian part of this meta region for example you know um initiatives that have been brought to band have you know borne political and economic fruit things like um the asean plus three initiatives which i am conceived of as modes of political and economic connectivities that include east northeast and southeast asia but exclude right um the americas and and the other side of the pacific if you like so there's already been contestation um of that broad asia pacific kind of imaginary in economic terms too in terms of trade agreements again this has been in the news recently would be familiar to many people an initiative like rcep again privileges this side of the pacific not that big trans-pacific sort of idea let me move on to the second strategic imaginary to open up on this idea of there being alternative imaginations of what ought to be the prioritized region what ought to be the prioritized connectivities to add on to that message of contestation which i've already begun to talk about the second strategic imaginary that i'm trying to sort of flesh out is the one of course that has come to bear and has been brought most to the public's and scholarly attention by the series of chinese initiatives which began in about 2013 and has now cumulatively become become called the belt and road initiative and the reason that i want to focus on this is because it is one of these meta regional concepts matter strategic imaginaries if you like that is equally ambitious right in conceptualization that would require also a significant investment of political economic and military possibly resources to bring to bear and to bring into fruition now of course th this is again a discourse that many of you will be familiar with so let me highlight a couple of things about what i'm calling you know the greater asia strategic imaginary that census around the belt and road initiative and why it's particularly significant from my point of view one is a basic geographical point right of course the rise of china has had numerous impacts on international relations from a geopolitical point of view the most significant impact of the rise of china is what you can see here on this diagram china's rise as a strategic and economic actor right since the 1980s has by itself recreated that missing link right which now through economic activities through political activity reconnects the three sub-regions of asia greater asia that had previously right not been as well connected to each other as before because of china's relative economic political um [Music] lack of profile shall we put it that way so china's rise in in recent decades has created an opportunity to reconnect north east southeast south central asia right it's the orange thing there that provides the bridge to these sub-regions of greater asia why is this important well there's a few ways we can think about this that i'll just highlight a couple of ways there's the traditional i mean we've heard a lot about this too there's the traditional idea um often attributed to alfred mckenda that you know whoever controls the eurasian heartland controls the world right that classic continental strategist's point of view that this is the crossroads of some of those the most productive regions of the world and saw that eurasian heartland in red there being a vital strategic matter re continental region of the world um a more recent um exposition on this which i quite like is ken calder's notion of you know how super continents get created right and again this is a sort of geographically based idea that has a great deal of resonance to what i'm calling the greater asia uh revival and we can think about this thinking of the example of the north american supercontinent right so if you switch to the left side of the map into the north american continent the idea of supercontinents is simply when a continent a large continent right can inject sufficient vitality into itself as a continental community right because the depth and the value of connectivities and exchanges within the continent exceeds what that continent has with other regions outside of the continent okay so one very simple way to think about this is how can we given something as large as the red bit there which is greater asia how would we have a situation in which we could have people in the you know what used to be called the far east you know in northeast asia markets in northeast asia being more densely and in value terms better connected to markets in what is europe right on that far side of the red bits of the map in a way that doesn't require them to use shipping routes okay one of the ways in which you create super continence is when you can escalate land-based over land right transcontinental connections across a continent and if we think about the example of north america this occurs in two in in the period of about 50 years right between i'm numerically dyslexic so i have to look up um dates properly between 1869 when the transcontinental railway the north american transcontinental railway is completed and 1914 when the panama canal is completed right these two advances in technology and connectivity essentially make it possible for the north american continent to become a supercontinent right one in which the connectivities between the east side of north america and the west side of north america are so well developed right that economic activity can primarily right occur within that continental context and the breaking through of the panama canal is the point that connects the pacific and atlantic ocean these two moves creates a continental base for economic development of north america and allows the united states particularly to project both ways through across the atlantic and across the pacific it becomes a dual oceanic great power essentially so if we think about that analogy then it becomes not so difficult is on the same sort of logic to think through the potential of what a matter region what a strategic imaginary like greater asia might do for the contemporary parallel of china in the asian context right um and it you know this is the reason why i i'm struggling to to try and sort of think of a label which i've now called greater asia for the summing up of this sort of activity that creation of connectivity across the eurasian heartland um whether you think about it in terms of you know overland connections um with you know from china into central asia and beyond or if you're thinking about it in terms of you know improving uh ports and sea routes um and other kind of economic corridors as well you know the the the impact is the intensification of connectivities across that greater asia strategic region right and of course this affects our part of southeast asia too speaking from singapore again similarly economic corridors transport corridors connectivities now again to emphasize just like in the asia-pacific strategic imaginary we would not be able to have right what i'm calling a greater asia imaginary without actual activity right and it's not just an act of imagination it is an act of investment it is an act that does require partners responses cooperation from other actors in the region being created and to bring these acts of connectivity into fruition now i have a few minutes left so i'm going to bring us to the third strategic imaginary which is where things get quite seriously competitive and it's the indo-pacific now again this is the one that we've you know thought most about in the news and so i'll try and do this quickly in many ways the indo-pacific strategic imaginary is the most ambitious of the three that we're looking at today the asia pacific and the greater asia ones are pretty ambitious already as they stand but the indo-pacific is in a class of its own right um it is geographically um to begin with to you know a confluence right of not of not just the pacific ocean but this notion that you know we ought to take the pacific ocean and the indian ocean together as one meta region and everything else in between right it doesn't look so bad on this map and then when you think about it on a proper projection this you know is the imagination of the indo-pacific it is literally the three circles that we've got here that whole thing in its most maximalist term is the indo-pacific imaginary right so in many ways the most ambitious of the three that we're looking at here it is of course indelibly associated with an early initiative of the quadrilateral partnership between india the united states australia and japan of course the japanese idea in conception an original conception and it's been given flesh if you like in a variety of ways the fact that we've got the four chord partners you know buying into this idea in the first place was a big push towards making this act of imagination you know a policy position and then a strategic position when the united states adopted the idea of the indo-pacific and formally re-conceived of the asia-pacific of the pacific command as the indo-pacific command this is a significant step as well in the road towards um making this um a reality and moving it away from imagination into fruition you know this is the updated map you know which slightly pivots the original pecan map to the west not doesn't quite capture again we have a problem with the projection of such a meta region and where we are we've where we've got to today is the sense in many many quarters that we've got two competing imaginaries right um two head to head competing imaginaries in the region um the indo-pacific and what i'm calling greater asia but which is often rendered as the bri in the discourse um i put up this very simple table really to pose this question um because the final point i want to leave you with is how do we think about these competing imaginary strategic imaginaries now that i've laid them up very quickly here on the table for you and in many ways the difficult part is not in identifying the individual competing imaginaries right that's not difficult it's also relatively easy to track the competing discourses and the efforts to mobilize and to use each of these imaginaries as an act of strategic competition that's relatively easy the harder part the harder analytical exercise is to think what does this amount to and what does this tell us about the nature of the kind of strategic competition that we're living through today and that we're bound to have to live with for decades at least to come and when i ask this question in putting up this comparison i often get two types of answers from people looking at the same table i get two diametrically opposed answers right from what you observe from this comparison the first answer is this one right which is that well obviously you know the differences between the ends you know means and narratives between these two primary strategy uh competing strategic imaginaries leads us back to the kind of cold war you know um zero-sum alternative visions of order right that you know and that's quite an instinctive answer it it many people give me that answer the second answer is quite a different one is people often say to me well when you look at it particularly when you look at the ways and means and the narratives these are actually complementary initiatives they're not competing for the same thing they're not using the same tools right um yes they can sort of coexist and there is a way to think about how this competition would work right alongside each other if you're sort of of that second persuasion then the mapping comes out something like this right it's not so much the you know cold war and curtain between them fight to the death you know until one side gives up the ghost or implodes the question becomes you know how do we manage and how do we navigate a regional order in which these three strategic imaginaries continue to coexist for quite some time right and continue to rub up against each other but do not necessarily lead to a situation in which it is a contest that requires one two imaginaries to be vanquished and one imaginary to come out at the end um as the triumphant soul exclusive idea that would dominate the rest um so you know we come to these two sets um of alternative ways to think about what to do with these strategic imaginaries and as always i mean i come back to my point about geopolitics you know suggesting that there are competing priority strategic connections communities what we're living through now is that contest it is unresolved um my my personal preference would obviously be the you know a situation in which there would be room for maneuver in which there would be a plurality of options or strategic imaginations and one in which we can think about sorry yeah think about how imagination action right um work together and in that sort of resulting process of contestation create a dynamic of its own that doesn't lead us towards the traditional idea that competition strategic competition is one that necessarily requires a zero-sum game right and that we could have a situation in which there was more than one game in town for quite some time and the main challenges become how do we think about navigating competition and contestation in that plural sort of realm i'm going to stop there on that fairly general concluding remark because i know that there'll be lots of questions and i know that now ko would want to kick that off so i'm going to leave enough time for that i do have extra slides which i can bring up if it relates to any of your questions that might come i would particularly welcome questions that have to do with specific points of view in southeast asia or other parts of asia thank you [Applause] well good evening i'm professor naoko shimazu and i'm a professor of humanities historian and of course i got tons of questions for evelyn but i've got to do some housekeeping announcement first which is that so before we go into the q a section of the lecture for our audience here at the performance hall please raise your hands if you have any questions and we will hand the microphone over to you for your online audience hello you can send your questions to us via the q and a chat box through zoom or the comment section on facebook and pros jing hao huang will be taking the questions on on the zoom chat box and um will be um signaling to me there would be questions coming along so what i'm going to do is um i'm going to um first of all thank you professor go for a very very illuminating lecture and i think what you've just given us really carries your signature sort of um sort of mark of the clarity of thought i really that's what i really love about your lectures and you have a very clear vision and it is always very thought provoking and it's a you know it's a very excellent and interesting way of capturing the current geostrategic conglomerations which overlap but also act um as sources of tension in in asia and i found your three key imaginaries um asia pacific the greater asia eurasian heartland i thought that was really interesting and the indo-pacific you've argued them very persuasively and made all these you know rather complex structures comprehensible even to a non-ir strategic non-specialist like myself and so your you know indeed your conception um of the key three key dual strategic imaginaries um i think what it does is that it complicates the strategic landscape of asia you know in quote in brackets unquote asia writ large because you explain the most the multiplicity of visions which exist or coexist and you focus a lot on the i think on the growing importance of china which kind of acts as a pivot in all of the three geostrategic imaginaries that you've explained to us and of course there is always the presence of the united states as the trans-pacific maritime power and i think that's a very interesting part of your imaginaries because somehow the united states can remain to be part of these different um scenarios or imaginaries that you you describe so so my question is this um as you know i'm i'm a historian and i've you know i've worked on the um kind of late 19th early 20th century um asia northeast asia and so i'm dying to know more about your views on russia really because russia has been a kind of historically a major continental asian power in the region and particularly in northeast asia you know in the ninth late 19th century and going into 20th century and also not only that if you look into the cold war period the soviet footprint is all over asia and and you know those of us old enough to remember this really you know remember it all too well um so how does russia figure in to your uh imaginaries um as an asian per and so i'm kind of interested in understanding whether there is any conception that russia is or can be considered still as an asian power because i think in if you look at um you know 19th and 20th century you can definitely consider you should definitely consider russia as um as an asian pie as well as european power and also the the complicated picture of course comes with the fact of your second imaginary the greater asia eurasia heartland vision um because of course you know we have the um central asian republics which were there previously as soviet republics of you know kazakhstan uzbekistan and so on and so forth and of course this silk road imaginary sort of joins them to the chinese imagination but in real life these former soviet republics still have a very strong links with moscow and um so i kind of wondered how that and also of course you know these areas had been colonized by the russian empire in the 19th century so i just kind of wondered how you think about you know the development of russia uh over the last um sort of few decades really and whether they sort of been whether you do see whether you think it's they've been sort of pushed out of this 21st century just strategic imaginations held by you know various states in the region trans region and so on um so that's one question and i could stop here for now um if there are more then i will ask another one but please okay thanks narco thank you for your very kind remarks and i let me take the russia question um i think if i would give you a short answer um i'd say that russia has been pushed out as you put it um in all of these um strategic imaginaries right and and in many ways they haven't been pushed out in a sense of active exclusion from the region but they have been sidelined if you like on the basis of relatively less competitive activity from russia since the end of the cold war in this part of the world whether you're thinking about economic competitiveness you know maritime presence um or military projection there's been a marked decline in russian profile prisons in uh this part in in asia uh since the end of the cold war so we're really seeing still the legacies of that post-cold war relative decline of russian activity and prisons in the region and and and the reason why i'm saying that they've been pushed out in all three of these imaginaries is that we've we haven't seen a great deal of strategic active reassertion or re-insertion of russia in in in key realms although there's been some degree of rhetoric the most the most important one i guess is you know the the degree to which russia uh strategically wishes to be a marriage significant maritime player in the pacific right um that's been you know not quite there really um i'm not saying that there aren't you know russian maneuvers ships etc they are but as a strategic player it's just been quite conspicuously lacking in that sense and you're right that the sort of great the revival of greater asia right is one in which it's a bit of a double-edged sword for russia in many ways right um it puts it it brings a great deal of attention and revival to to areas of central asia you know and the eurasian heartland that are incredibly important to russia at the same time you know it presents diversification of patrons and um uh and and support structures for parts of uh what were previously russian client states right so so that that's that's not a particularly particularly in the form of china um so again the cumulative result for russia still is an increase in competition for russian strategic presence in in these regions um and so when you put those things together i see russia as lagging behind in terms of aspirational or actual strategic activity in asia and given the way russian strategic ambitions and priorities have been articulated particularly under putin and particularly in recent years it seems unlikely that we would see a very significant investment of russian strategic attention to they are quite likely to be distracted and then focused on on other um european side matters for for the foreseeable future yeah so that's why it doesn't really feature a great deal in the analysis i think yeah okay well thank you very much for that um i'm going to um open the floor to yes and i think we have a question there um professor daniqua thank you professor golfer wonderful wonderful lecture so enjoyable to get to listen to you my question has to do with whether we identify the strategic imaginary in your language as an auxiliary as an additional driving force or is it the case that it is merely passively responding to the imperatives of power and economics and and i think in your lecture you're very careful to to describe it appropriately but someone not so careful might think that you are arguing that the all narratives of power and economics are no longer really the critical ones but the strategic imaginaries are and i suppose the evidence i want to draw out from your maps is that the the outstanding striking strategic imaginaries that capture the imagination are all also collinear with political power and economic prowess but the ones that don't capture the imagination seem to be quite compelling in their strategic imaginary features but don't figure in your story about global geopolitics and those two are latin and central america and africa if we look at just the map one could say that those are strategically critical for how you might want to run the world africa is central in you know the landmass of all of the continents but yet it has never never figured prominently geopolitically so i wonder coming back to my question is is the strategic imaginary in your view a valuable framework for us to conduct this discourse or does it have an independent driving force to it thank you so much i enjoyed your lecture so much thank you can i respond first to this because quite a complex question and and of course one that is very difficult professor danny kwa thank you for that question um i think i i am i to be very social science in our response i'm not arguing that strategic imaginaries are an independent variable in their own right i'm not i see them rather as that's what i meant at the beginning when i said you know i just want to remind us right that what we take for granted very often in the discourse right we take these meta regional containers we take them for granted we act like the asia pacific is something normal it what i'm trying to say is not normal right and then we act like you know what china is trying to do in the bri is wildly unrealistic it's never going to happen because it's too big a region i'm like yeah but the in the pacific is even bigger you know and the asia pacific prior to you know those twin developments 1869 1914 was an unimaginable thing as well and and so i what i'm not trying to argue for a new independent variable called strategic inventories and try to remind us that significant critical junctures in geopolitical evolution have been based on acts of strategic imagination have been based on cumulative decisions driven by distribution of power and economic ability and technological developments you know that have allowed um prioritized connectivities to be to be made into reality but there was whole political process behind turning those acts of imagination into projects that people would want to invest in into big strategic visions that governments would want to put resources behind again the transcontinental railroad and panama canal projects are really really good reminders of this today we think that these things are matter of course they weren't right each of those projects took you know something between 50 and 70 years to lobby for raise funds for get investment not investment not just in the resource for investment and the idea that this made strategic sense so that's what i was trying to do that to to to sort of say you know this stuff is not it's not common sense in in that and we're living at a time in which we're seeing at least two new meta regions in the act of competitive construction i don't know if these will become realities like the asia pacific eventually became a reality um they may not but what an exciting time to be living in when when we're actually you know seeing those political and other processes playing out right um in a fairly open-ended way um so i guess that's what i'm and so i don't disagree with anything that that um that you've said danny i think you're quite right and again you know the reason why latin america and africa have so consistently been left out of those prioritized you know choices about prioritizing is because they didn't have that confluence of geography with political power you know and with that what i've loosely called cultural diversity but what i actually mean is the prioritization you know of the cultural and political organizational models if you like right that that others wanted to emulate right so in spite of their objective geographical significance they aren't strategic or they haven't been made strategic because there wasn't the confluence there hasn't been yet the confluence of of those three elements which i argued underpins geopolitics i hope that makes sense thank you for your really good question okay um professor juan yes some questions from the zoom chat box now yes two interrelated questions for professor go from the online audience the first to serve to what extent to smaller countries or regional entities like singapore asean or even the european countries the eu to what extent do these smaller countries or entities have agency in contributing to or driving these strategic imaginaries and i guess related to that a second part of that question is what policy challenges then do you foresee for these countries that sit in the center of all these three strategic imaginaries specifically in terms of navigating these emerging rivalries or competing imaginaries thanks yes let me illustrate with the asean part of the questions i think the two questions are can be answered together um you know one of the most interesting things of course um is this question of you know the degree of contestation adaptation and constant negotiation that goes on in each of these imaginaries i said for the asia-pacific one that you know that's not let's not assume that these imaginaries are perfectly formed or uncontested and if we think about the indo-pacific imaginary as an example to answer that question um you know the the asean response right because it is the sub-region that that basically sits as the pivot point in this large enterprise of trying to connect the indian and the pacific oceans the other response has been very interesting it's fundamentally been driven by a number of concerns right broadly if we were to generalize very broadly right southeast asian strategic preferences right still coalesce around trying to retain a key us presence in the region right and to try to encourage and through various means constrained and restrained on the part of china as the risen power in the region you know their strategic preferences broadly coalesce around those two points in response to something like the indo-pacific strategic matter the main concerns would be that you know trying to bring this set of indo-pacific policy and strategic actions into fruition would over antagonize china on the one hand right and or on the other hand might end up alienating the us and its allies if it didn't work right and you know the southeast asian responses to this have been interesting because they illustrate the degree of agency that even relatively small states can have in this ongoing process right of the creation of a new meta region um just very quickly there's been a number of ways in which asean has has responded collectively to the indo-pacific idea to try and shape it and to try and channel it in ways that are more acceptable right or less threatening if i may put it that way um to their to asean preferences okay um the one thing that we probably would be aware of sitting in this region is the asean response um formally in you know adopting a certain language that that um accepts you know that there is this idea of an another imaginary called the indo-pacific asean indeed you know had a whole report and a whole sort of document on on the outlook on the indo-pacific so there's been a direct engagement with that what's really interesting about that is the subsequent to that asean's pretty much gone back to using asia pacific southeast asia asean and is traditional lexicon of strategic imaginaries and has pretty much never used not really never consistently used in the pacific apart from that outlook document right so it's engaged but then decided to simply hew back to its traditional imaginaries and it's also in repeated context emphasized that other norms existing as your norms right already adequately right reflect some of the normative ambitions that the proponents of the indo-pacific strategic imaginary want to pro you know push forward in the indo-pacific initiatives for example this sense of you know inclusive regionalism right the other argument has always been that yes but our fora already include in all the partners that you want to have in your indo-pacific meta cooperative enterprises they are already invited to you know these various uh meetings and cooperative enterprises so there's no real need to come up with sort of alternative ones and so this sort of response of non-use or very selective engagement has been an important one and has had some degree of impact for example in shaping japan's evolving response and shape in its japan's own shaping as one of the key proponents of the indo-pacific imaginary how it's evolved that and i don't have time to go into japan right now and that wasn't the question asked but suffice to say that you know the japanese for their part have taken into account asean's responses to the indo-pacific imaginaries in in in re-orienting their approach to uh their indo-pacific campaign if you like so you know the short answer is small states do in this process of negotiation and creation have a degree of agency thank you okay we're going to revert back to the floor and professor rohan mukherjee thank you so much for that great presentation um my question was about the uh that there's more than one game in town uh the last part of your talk um i feel like that both those things may be true that there's sort of zero some areas and there's non-zero-sum areas so in some areas there are complementarities in what china or the greater asia vision can do alongside the indo-pacific region but in other areas and some might argue these areas are more consequential such as standards for the governance of the internet standards for 5g technology even the standards that are used in the rcep versus say the cptpp those areas seem to be intractable from a not from a zero-sum point of view without sort of great power cooperation and we're not seeing any of that forthcoming in fact it seems to be tending in the opposite direction with the u.s trying to u.s sanctuary are both competing to impose alternative standards and there for other states including these states there would be huge inefficiencies and costs if they were to actually take that non-zero sum approach so do you see a way forward in this domain thank you thanks rohan um again a very typical question from from um professor mukherjee thank you i think you're right i don't disagree with you it's um when i've talked about this in in other places you know i i've said that what we're basically lurching towards you know is is a system in which we've got a really messy pluralism right or pluralization whether we're thinking in terms of you know the spread of authority or whether we're thinking about you know ways in which particularly emerging areas are being governed right it's a very messy pluralization so you're absolutely right it's not a lumpen picture of oh it's a zero-sum game or it's not a zero-sum game there are certain sectors and areas in which yeah the way it's playing out seems to present there are some choices particularly for third-party states right um which which you know either have to take it or leave it in many ways and and govern you know provision of 5g governance of some of the sort of um emerging areas of standard setting particularly beyond 5g right uh would would largely appear to be that what i find really interesting in some of these areas is you know who's pushing the zero sum right and and it's often interesting that the zero sum choice set is being put forward by the incumbent um hedgemon right it's not being pushed forward by the rising challenger as such the rising challenges and and i'm speaking about raising challenges to rohan of course because this is his area of specialization rising challenges tend to do this thing of presenting alternatives right it's not in their preferred strategic playbook to say here's a zero-sum game quite the opposite um so we see that playing out right um in many ways the the standard setting game um is being constricted uh by the united states and its allies but you know as quite a specific form of containment if you like while you have china going but there's another way to do this and here is our alternative arbitration procedure et cetera et cetera so i find that to be interesting but again like i said messy pluralization and you're right okay um is there do you have some more questions from the yes online audience yes there's another question and i guess i'll package two of them together um it goes back to the sort of zero-sum mindset so a pretty innocuous question but i think one that might be useful for you to clarify why do you think there's a so strong of a zero-sum mindset that's so deeply entrenched in some of these strategic imaginaries we sort of touched on that just now but maybe a little bit more of an elaboration particularly with the greater eurasian greater asia and the indo-pacific um and the follow-up question to that then is would the first strategic imaginary the asia-pacific one then emerge or re-emerge as sort of the compromise version going forward or the one that's actually most promising going forward so so going back to the past or the future however what you however where you want to see it thank you oh i'm glad that that last question was asked because that was something that um i wanted to pay some attention to um there's a bit of a debate right some of the this course on the indo-pacific kind of assumes that the old asia-pacific imaginary would then get subsumed into this bigger meta indo-pacific thing in a seamless way right and i'm not i'm just not too sure that um that that's necessarily that straightforward um and i like that proposition that's come from that uh person who's posed the question that indeed we may have the kind of outcome where we may revert to the asia-pacific incumbent um imaginary because it is the one that in many ways has the most flesh and has the most lived reality has the wheels which are already in motion and the connections which have already been forged and the paths already trotted i think that that is true and which is that's the reason why i do not i always start with the asia pacific incumbent imaginary because it is the one that has more splash on the bones and not necessarily one that you know would be necessary to kill in order to make the other two um a reality so yes i do agree with that that suggestion that that we mustn't take our eyes of that one um and and on that regard just a final point on the asia-pacific imaginary i i'd never downplay the economic the significance of the degree and level of economic interchange you know and exchange that underpins the asia-pacific all right um and that seems to me you know it's something in which where it seems to me we're seeing a great deal of reinvestment in those asia-pacific economic um exchanges which will continue to buttress the reality of that strategic imaginary in to a degree that we're not seeing certainly not in the indo-pacific and that is more questionable because we're still in the process in the second imaginary this question of why is there such a strong mindset that assumes zero sum choices is a fascinating one of course and i think those of us in the audience who who are either yourselves policy makers or have a great deal to do with policy-making communities would find this to be a familiar puzzle and i think there's two reasons for this the first is that in some ways a lot of our training pushes us towards dichotomies right especially social sciences not so much humanities scholars but you know dichotomies are easier to analyze we can hold stuff constant it's easier to get an either or answer so all our modeling and our sort of frameworks de facto right are dichotomous so again it's a well-worn groove that shapes our assumptions and this permeates things like strategic studies international relations to a large degree as well the other one the other reason of course is the shadow of the cold war right the last time what many people reflexively think back to the cold war because that was the last time in which we had this kind of strategic competition and in that strategic competition the presentation and the lived reality was a very stark zero-sum um took place in a very stark zero-sum frame of course if you lived through it it wasn't always that clear as well right it wasn't that black and white but in presentation in memory in how we're taught about it it was a zero-sum game so for those two reasons i think we've got to constantly battle this this zero-sum mindset yeah okay we have one minute left i think from a student i think we would if it's okay if you could uh tell us your name and um hi my name is axel um firstly thank you very much for your insightful lecture um you mentioned the indo-pacific and belton road initiative strategic imaginaries with different roles of the great powers the united states and china i would be interested to hear your view on another emerging emerging great power india which strategic imaginary do you see india siding with or do you expect a push from india for a new strategic imaginary thank you um in the interest of time i'll be quite brief there's of course a great deal to say about india which is you know fascinating study in its own right and and i'm not by any means an expert on india there are others in the room um but i i think to date the imaginary that india has been most explicitly associated with is of course the the indo-pacific one right because it's one of the court powers but if you look at that india's engagement even with the indo-pacific imaginary it's been rather ambivalent right and and that pretty much is i think related to india's own position as very much a rising power in the sense of a power that is finding its way right to project beyond the subcontinent right paradoxically in spite of its maritime strategic location india's for so long in recent decades very much been a continental subcontinental power so it's in that stage of trying to think beyond that and very much still trying to get its head and its act around that i think so we've caught india that point in its own development where you know it it's it's not quite there yet so there's a lot of wait and see um when it comes to watching india's engagement with with this sort of um dynamic strategic competition but i think it's it's one that's well worth watching and of course you you have other professors here who are much more qualified to give you the ins and outs of the indian case um but thank you thank you for that question okay well thank you very much for all the questions and i'm really sorry um we're running out of time and thank you to the online audience um also for for your fabulous questions and i i think we're going to give you a big round of thank you so applause much for that evening and also i have a message here which is that the college would love to hear

was devoted to that commemoration that law really began the revolution in research and treatment that still continues to unfold today it was President Nixon's focus on Research and his prudent understanding that a cure will take time that has inspired us to make this conference an annual event so let's now hear more from President Nixon when President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act of 1971 he launched a new era in the annals of cancer treatment and research for the first time the resources of the federal government and equally important to the focus of presidential involvement would be directed at one disease at the White House signing ceremony on December 23rd he expressed his high hopes for this unprecedented initiative members of the senate members of the House ladies and gentlemen we are here today for the purpose of signing the cancer Act of 1971. and I hope that in the years ahead that we may look back on this day and this action as being the most significant action taking during this Administration it could be because when we consider what cancer does each year in the United States we find that more people each year die of cancer in the United States than all the Americans who lost their lives in World War II this shows us what is at stake it tells us why I sent a message to the Congress the first of this year which provided for a national commitment to for the conquest of cancer to attempt to find a cure while his hopes were high his expectations were realistic we would not want to raise false hopes by simply the signing of an act but we can say this that for those who have cancer and who are looking for success in this field they at least can have the assurance that everything that can be done by government everything that can be done by voluntary agencies in this great powerful rich country now will be done and that will give some hope and we hope those hopes will not be disappointed the work and advocacy of philanthropist Mary Lasker and the Council of his friend Elmer boast and played pivotal roles in the president's personal interest in this legislation during the Nixon Administration both houses of Congress were controlled by the Democratic Party and passage of the National Cancer Act was a case study in bipartisanship this is an indication of the priorities you know the Congress had a very long session and finally got adjourned we all appreciated that fact incidentally but once they adjourned they did too once they adjourned and they were to go home and go on their vacations to have this many members of the House and Senate who are members of the committee back here shows How Deeply they feel and I think that for that reason we'd like to record this for a picture so go ahead we don't have to tell House and Senate members how to get in the picture [Music] at the beginning of 1971 in his State of the Union Address on January 22nd the president announced the Bold vision I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra 100 million dollars to launch an intensive campaign to find the cure for cancer and I will ask later for whatever additional funds can effectively be used the time has come in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the Moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease [Applause] legislation followed and in may he gave an update and stressed his personal involvement you will recall that in the State of the Union message I announced a program of 100 million dollars to find a cure for cancer in order to implement the program the Secretary of Hew sent to the Congress today a legislation that will set up a program the cancer cure program in the National Institute of Health this however will differ from other programs in a very important respect uh this program I have asked the the one program within the National Institute of Health and within the Whole Health establishment of the United States that is independently budgeted and that is directly responsible to the president of the United States I have assumed this responsibility have asked this responsibility because of a very deep personal concern about this problem as many millions of American families have concern about the problem and also because I believe that direct presidential interest and presidential guidance May hasten the day that we will find a cure for cancer I remember my perhaps my favorite aunt my aunt Elizabeth died with cancer when she was just 32 years of age and she was a wonderful person so full of life and and my mother's I think favorite sister we could each of us in our lives think of personal examples of what this disease does and how it takes strong men and strong women and destroys them in a matter of a few weeks or months or at best a year now there have been some very significant breakthroughs breakthroughs that indicate that we can really look forward to the day that we can find a cure for cancer it doesn't mean it's going to come quickly how quickly it will come will depend upon the amount of effort that is put in and also depend upon the genius of those who are working on the problem but as far as the Cure is concerned and as far as the time when it is found it will not fail because of lack of money if a hundred million dollars this year is not enough we will provide more money to the extent money is needed it will be provided it will not fail for lack of organization the organization is being set up will call upon all of the resources of the National Institute of Health and of course you cannot separate any one disease out without having the various experts in the other fields being able to make a contribution and finally it will not suffer for a lack of organization being directed and having special presidential interest each year the president requested additional funds for cancer research in 1972 400 million dollars in 1973 500 million and in 1974 is last year in the white house he requested an additional 600 million during the Nixon Administration more than one and a half billion dollars went to cancer research and treatment in November 2021 the American medical association's journal oncology reported that mortality rates for all cancers combined had dropped by 27 percent since 1971. and by 32 since 1991 when mortality rates were highest in the 1985 interview the former president responded to a question from Barbara Walters how would you like to be remembered I suppose everyone would like to be remembered particularly for his major achievements most people would point for example to the opening to China which changed the world but as I look back during the White House years I think for example of an initiative which many people have forgotten the cancer initiative you remember we started that in 1971. and it was brought home to me just a couple of days ago my brother Don has cancer it's a very serious case he's now taking radiation and chemotherapy ten years ago his doctor told him he would be dead so that initiative may have helped uh prolong his life in the life of other cancer patients what I'm suggesting here is that we all think of well he went to China he ended the war in Vietnam he opened relations with the Soviet Union through Dayton but in my view if the cancer initiative which we began could save lives that'd be worth all the rest put together [Music] foreign [Applause] President Nixon emphasize the importance of direct presidential involvement in cancer treatment and research he said quote you cannot separate one disease out without having experts in other fields making contributions he said the Cure will not come soon but it will come from the amount of effort put in and the genius of those who are working on the problem Dr Andrew Von eschenbach exemplifies and radiates those qualities we met Dr Von ishenbach last year for the inaugural conference on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the National Cancer act and through a series of pandemic-induced Zoom calls the first call I have to say was very daunting to be on camera with the former director of the National Cancer Institute and commissioner of the FDA and he's coming to us from his office at MD Anderson we were we were immediately impressed with his enthusiasm his sense of humor and his wisdom and he became a leader and a mentor and a friend we were introduced to Andy from two very notable Von eschenbach Advocates Marlene Malik and Ellen Siegel of friends of cancer research and I've come to learn that when those two are in favor of something you should be as well so it's my pleasure this evening to invite Andy and Marlene to come up to the stage for a special announcement [Applause] tonight is my honor and great pleasure to recognize Dr Von eschenbach and to announce that the Richard Nixon Foundation has established a new annual award to be given to an individual whose work has contributed to advances in research and treatment that has relieved suffering and prolonged and saved lives and whose Vision continues to inspire and the award will be called the Andrew vanishenbach award so Andy tonight night let us pay tribute to you with this special gift this is an American flag that was flown over President Nixon's birthplace just steps from here and we look forward with great pleasure to selecting with you in consultation with you and Marley and the awards first recipient next year so let me give this to you [Applause] sleep ing let's get a picture great thank you thank you thank you for being here and for your championship of the significant element of the Nixon legacy thank you [Applause] ladies and gentlemen the Nixon National Cancer conference is presenting sponsor tonight A City of Hope Orange County which of course just opened its Lennar Foundation Cancer Center a few months ago in July the physician in Chief and Senior vice president is Dr Edward S Kim who also serves as a vice physician in Chief and professor at City of Hope National Medical Center Dr Kim is a leading expert in molecular prognostication which advances lung excuse me which advances cancer detection and personalized therapies for long head and neck cancer and he has been recognized by our friends at friends of cancer research is one of the top cancer leaders in the nation Dr Kim is now bringing his knowledge and his research and his experience to Orange County in which you please welcome him this evening foreign [Applause] nobody told me I was going to have to take the stage after Andy and Marlene so I feel like I should sit down I mean congratulations it's such a great honor our applaud again for all your work that you've done so both of you [Applause] so December 23rd 1971 and and some of this was really highlighted by the video that you just saw this was really a landmark legislation that occurred the National Cancer act it set forth this coordinated system all across the country that really led to Federal and non-federal systems and partners to battle cancer and you know to get a state of what cancer was like in the 70s and I don't know I was coming out of my mom's womb right around there it was um and they had to force me out I was a C-section I mean I just I hung in there for quite some time but but people didn't want to talk about this disease in fact doctors didn't even want to tell people about this disease they didn't want to refer them to Specialists to get treatment because it was so poor so that was transformative and now you have this leading the U.S leading this charge across not only our country but over the continent over the worlds and that's what changed things it empowered institutions like the National Cancer Institute and brought funding because we know funding is what changes things set up cancer research international data banks and you know really led us into this remarkable advancements I mean there isn't a day that you go by on either the Twitter feed or the LinkedIn or whatever the everyone uses on social media that there's another drug that's been approved for another indication and that's really really great we've seen it as highlighted in the video that in this annual report we are seeing progress it takes time and it's a two decade Trend where cancer mortality rates are going down and this is great it occurs in prevention detection treatment people are living longer now what was kind of cool was in 1970 when President Nixon was getting all this advice from advisors to Congress one of the things they talked about was the long term the midterm and the short-term future of how the treatment was unfortunately oncologists were placed more in the short term but the long-term future of curing this disease was going to belong to the immunologist and the geneticist how prescient was that back in the 1970s that that's what the advice was so in 71 it's ironic the same year that this legislation was signed there was a drug called tamoxifen that was first reported this was a drug that was I think is a very symbolic drug because it was first being developed as an oral contraceptive I think I can say that that's okay right I mean it's a proof language um it's uh I'm old school I just don't say those kind of things but then it was approved for metastatic cancer for patients who are battling Advanced cancer so it went from an oral contraceptive to a drug that was helping people who had incurable breast cancer and then came back around to be a preventive drug for people who have high risk so it went the full gamut wasn't even in cancer went to advance cancer and now as a preventative and that was because of the breast cancer prevention trial that was reported in 1998. huge success led to an Era of how we use these oral therapies that can be cytotoxics and kill cancers to try and prevent them one of the things that we kind of asterisk is that even though that trial as pivotal as it was it didn't really enroll minority populations only three percent of the women in that study were of a minority and 1.7 percent were black so we still had a lot of work to do back then and we're learning those lessons now as we go forward now cancer research as is talked about has done a lot of other things it's sped the development of new treatments in new areas and covet 19. we have vaccines now that have allowed us to have events like this and to see each other in person and that's that's really great you know but all these successes we need to really credit the minds of people who are in the audience tonight and who are listening in you all represent academic centers from across the country communities who care about this and the best and the brightest of the 21st Century you're here you're collaborating you're partnering you want to understand this disease that we've been battling for the last 50 years and there's no doubt if we were had those same scientists who were in there in the room with Congress they would be astounded at what we've accomplished because of their push their desire now just a little personally I I always remember my mentors as I go through Juan Ki Hong Derek ragavan Mike Calgary these are people who have moved fields of chemo prevention equity and inclusion and immunobiology tonight we're excited you're going to hear a panel tonight and these are some of the greats you know Morrow Ferrari is here Bob gattenby and Patrick sunshine and he's working on something very interesting who we'll call it a triangle offense going back to the uh Chicago Bulls days of macrophages natural killer cells and memory T cells and that he's got some very impressive outcomes so along with all this amazing brain power I have to really give credit to our conference organizers you remind us that we're not here to show you PowerPoint slides and Dazzle you with new data and such our focus is on the people and that's our patience they're the ones who have to benefit from all this so as much as we have you know the research that fascinates us and stirs our scientific curiosity we recognize the true Focus really must lie with the people who support and I applaud all of you who are Advocates who are policy makers you are difference makers the Marlene Maliks With Friends of cancer research are leaders who are represented here from our hospitals and our neighbors and our partners here we all are in this together we are all doing this together you are all Pioneers in this fight so this is something my colleagues at City of Hope that we instill in one another we we know when we're on the cusp of some significant Discovery we got to measure that by the way it eases burden on our patients should not only help them live longer but live better and those are really need to be tracked you know you're going to hear from this conference from different folks whether it's Linda malkus who studies a drug called aoh1996. look that up it's got a great story I'll have to talk to her about it Steve Foreman who's pioneering car T and Transplant or Rich Lee who's up here who's conducting the first nci-funded cannabis study and that is there to help patients live and feel better so when you consider all these cancer advances over the last half century we've got to credit those who have also transformed the patient experience we need to recognize that there's equal importance to the science of care delivery I think that's where we need to transform we can't have people hiding from their diagnoses to be scared to let us know that they need help whether it's the patient the caregiver and this is through education participating in informed decision making equity and treatment accessibility these are all really important and should never eclipse the burden of what cancer is so more than 100 years ago City hope is over 100 years old Sam Golder who is one of our early founders he said there's no prophet in curing the body if in the process we destroy the soul and if you reflect on these words you realize that these Souls that he's referencing belong both to our patients but also to ourselves so advances in science have to align with advances in our Humanity so in this spirit let's come together let's learn let's collaborate let's become better the next 50 years that's going to be exciting I probably won't be around for it but several younger people will be but that's great we look forward to those advances and we all want to fight I want to challenge us all to fight for the Cure you'll hear that word a lot and cure means a lot of things to different people to me cure stands for can you reimagine everything okay can you think about how we think the immune system works how we prevent cancer utilization of naturopathic medicines access and inclusion for our real world diverse communities think outside the box go against our tendencies open our minds to new ideas and approaches doing this we're going to continue to be the source of Hope especially for those who we serve today and for generations to come thank you very much let's have a great conference [Applause] so we're going to go into the panel session next so I'll invite our panelists to come up and Dr sung will be on video and so we'll get set foreign all right good all right Patrick do we have you on can you hear us sorry I'm not there but I'm excited and privileged to be part of this uh honored uh panel here it's kind of an unusual topic I think ghoul maybe talking about math physics science uh but that is really important to what I want to make sure that I want to make sure that we can go through and have everybody talk about really their interests I want to start with introductions this panel is uh very esteemed and as there's a lot of brain power up here thank you okay so let's start uh let's start to our to my left here so Mark why don't you go ahead it take a couple minutes and tell us who you are what you do and uh and then we'll get on with it thank you it's a great Delight to be here I was here last year as well it's a delight that the topics that we started introducing last year the emotion about math and physics have played and continue to play an important part in cancer and hopefully even more in the future those have resonated which is why we brought them back with some of the greatest I'm not speaking about myself my job is to bring down the average year but everybody else is great what I do right now I am a professor at the University of Washington and Professor Thomas I'm an entrepreneur I've been my whole life I'm president and CEO of a company called breed Pharmaceuticals which is in Texas in California and in Italy which is my native country in the past for about 10 years I was president and CEO in Houston or the Methodist Research Institute for about seven years I was Executive Vice President of the hospital system as well before that there was a professor at Berkeley I was at Ohio State was it MD Anderson who had the privilege of meeting at Kim I had a great privilege of serving as an advisor to end immunization back and to embarker that we will meet later in the in the conference so I've been blessed with the opportunities of being in great places surrounded by absolutely world-class World Changers and to bring the tools that help bring the tools that math and physics can provide for All Phases of the fight against cancer Diagnostics prevention therapy quality of life and I hope that this panel will help illustrate that and given the great stature of my colleagues and trust that he will so thank you very much Evan great thank you Mara Bob thank you thank you for inviting me I'm I had a physics background in college before going to medical school and doing training and after training we began working at the varsities Cancer Center and uh you know whenever you work with cancer patients you really want to try to make a difference and so I really started to try to learn more and more about cancer and what struck me was that cancer is really a complex dynamic system a complex because it has many parts uh Dynamic that because these parts work together they interact in very complicated ways um the most well-known complex ionic system is the weather and and how do we how do we predict the weather well we we use data we use first principles the the the Navigator Stokes equations and we use uh computer simulations um and now this is not new to physicists physicists have used theoreticians and experimentalists working together to to understand these systems for four centuries but it was different in in biology and so at that time I really sort of went back and tried to learn the biology I'm sorry we were in the mathematics and to bring those mathematics uh to cancer and uh to to use in our case the first principles are Evolution and then to apply those principles uh to a wide range of cancer biology and therapy um 15 years ago the leadership at the Moffitt Cancer Center uh made the Bold uh agreement that they would bring mathematicians into the cancer center to establish a Cadre of theoreticians who could consistently work with here's the empirical uh the scientists and the and the clinicians and and that has been going on since then uh we now have eight faculty mathematicians two evolutionary biologists uh serving again in this sort of physics Paradigm where you have theoreticians and experimentals working in a Lock Stock so we have uh even clinical trials going on that are based on evolutionary principles but Guided by mathematical models analyzed by mathematical models so we're trying to integrate all of that into the day-to-day work of a Cancer Center and I'll talk a little bit more about that one yeah thanks Bob and Patrick online [Music] um doing doing pancreas transplants and at the same time working all the Don Morton doing angry working with pancreatic cancer so uh in that sort of environment in which in my pancreas transplant will patients I was trying to tap down the tap down the immune system so the walking doesn't get rejected and my pancreatic cancer moments I was trying to activate the immune system so that we could kill the cancer so that drove a lot of my work as a scientist at UCLA tomorrow was involved then when President Clinton launched the nanotechnology program and I was the recipient of that as usually we ran the nanotechnology Institute for 10 years and part of that was to bring on the Large Hadron Collider National Lambda rail with in order to bring super Computing together so I ran the National Lab derail and then became a NASA scientist so that's a sort of strange background because as part of my NASA scientist role I was part of the Space Shuttle and that's where the idea came that we would actually feed the tumor rather than stop the tumor so you heard about this whole statement that the long game for cancer is actually going to be identified and broken through from The Code by cross-disciplines of immunologists mathematicians of complex Dynamic analysis so I've spent the last 20 or 30 years trying to understand the immune system and our first molecule was a vaccine where in which we created a protein nanoparticle to get into the tumor and it got approved for pancreatic cancer lung cancer and breast cancer and that started my journey where for the last 10 years I need to understand how to break the code of our immune system and activate the human body rather than destroy the immune system and not only treat late stage metastatic disease to get to complete remission but also actually to begin uh soon with the National Cancer Institute the first preventive cancer trial in the nation for Lynch syndrome as well as cancer prevention for patients with human papillomavirus so I look forward to having this discussion about uh where we are from a current position I'm now chairman of immunity bio which is a public traded company in which we're pursuing this goal of activating your immune system and changing the Paradigm of how we treat cancer patients great thank you Patrick and so what I wanted each of our panelists to share is maybe about 10 minutes just to talk about some of their thoughts their ideas it's a very eclectic panel it's a very forward-thinking panel so Bob I'm going to have you start actually if that's okay to describe what the work you've done the work you see moving forward and then we'll go through with each of the others um I'm guessing that do not look back on their mathematics and physics educational experiences fondly so we won't talk about that I'm just going to maybe tell a few stories um one story is about Benjamin Franklin a great Patriot great politician but also great scientist um in in 1774 uh he was living in Philadelphia wanted to see a lunar eclipse but a nor'easter occurred if you've lived in Philadelphia you know that the Nor'easter is often destructive storm where the winds come out of the Northeast now uh Franklin believe like all scientists to this day that the wind carried the storm the wind carried the storm and so he assumed that his brother in Boston would not have been able to see the eclipse and was shocked to learn a few days later that the storm arrived in Boston after the eclipse was over what Franklin realized what he's doing was applying linear thinking to a non-linear complex dynamic system linear system is if you have X you get 2i 2x easy 4y 3x if you 6y a longular system you know X might give you 2i but 2x might give you minus 5y 3x might give you 12y it it doesn't have that linearity human intuition is really good at linear systems and it's really bad at non-window systems so something like you know the wind carries the storm seems both intuitively obvious and dead wrong so fast forward here we are between Cancer and how do we treat cancer it's been uh the Dogma among oncologists for perhaps five decades that when you give a therapy you give at maximum tolerated dose continuously until progression that's kind of the Dogma um I would argue that this is when you're thinking apply to a non-linear system and the non-linearity of cancer is that it evolves it evolves resistance so we can continue to do this with the goal of creating of a cure but almost inevitably in a metastatic setting the tumor of laws resistance that's that's Evolution that's non-linearity and so the question is can we bring to bear mathematical models from Evolution to understand that process and to make it better and so uh the first kind of uh look was can we use instead of just continuous maximum tolerated dose you can you can look at this as a game and we've done this game theoretic analysis the game is being played by the by the cancer doctor in applying the therapy the tumor responds to that and plays the game by adapting in that game the oncologist has two enormous advantages one is the oncologist's place first the tumor cannot begin to evolve until the cancer doctor has played a a treatment that's the equipment that's called a stackable game and it's equivalent of plain white pieces in Chess you always begin first the second thing is the oncologist is sentient can apply dynamically can understand the future can anticipate responses cancers like all um evolving systems can only adapt to current conditions they can never anticipate the future so how do we treat cancer well the oncologist gives the same therapy over and over and over the cancer does not have to play anything different to the can the oncologist is being very static while the while the while the tumor is slowly uh evolving resistance and growing and expanding um the oncologist does not change therapy until the tumor grows until it's expanded the leadership of the game is seeded to the cancer that causes this following the cancer not weeding and so our goal is to try to get ahead of that to have the cancer doctors play dynamically using illusive evolution so our first goal was to try to use that to prolong response to existing drugs and we use various tricks to do that we have a number of clinical trials the initial clinical trials have been really quite quite successfully we are able to greatly expand uh the time to progression greatly expand the overall survival while reducing the amount of drugs we've received the second approach is something that you've probably heard on the on this uh uh that the president is talking about doc cure for cancer we keep talking about that not cure for cancer like it's a thing it's a drug and and earlier the great scientist in the early 20th century talked about Magic Bullets the idea that we could find something that would kill the cancer cells and not the host cells we haven't done that um so what what is this what is it about an evolutionary point of view what is curing cancer you could say it's causing Extinction and whenever we think about Extinction we always go to the dinosaurs I mean popular imagination always goes to Dinosaurs the the sudden application of massive evolutionary Force single events single cause wipe them out we've cured the world of dinosaurs but what we have also done is eradicated 60 of these land animals brute force is indiscriminate and Brute Force which is arguably kind of the approach that we take with maximum tolerated dose of single drugs is always going to be limited by toxicity to the to the to the host cells so the question is do we is dinosaurs the the right approach and and we live in the anthropocene era and which means that our our species is killing off other species and that's tragic but the Silver Lining is that allows us to look at species extinctions and it turns out that these Dynamics are not the Dinosaurs the dinosaur was unusual the species Extinction generally go along a specific route and what's interesting is that it typically requires multiple perturbations none of which by itself can cause Extinction it's this kind it's the sequence of them so one more story and I'll stop uh the Galapagos go um the the Galapagos Islands of darwinian Fame uh the sailors and Pirates and various people used to stop in on their journey and they would leave goats behind that was so they when they came back there would be food for them over centuries these this goat population began to expand so that by the 1990s there was 500 000 goats on the islands they were they were destroying the uh the native foliage they were crowding out the native species and so the world leadership decided that we needed to kill them this is an intentional anthropocene Extinction and it was called the Isabella project so what do we do they took New Zealand Sharpshooters gave them automatic weapons flew them in helicopters over the hers and they gunned them down maybe it was a Carnage the population was decimated rapidly declined but then it stopped declining why because some of the goats began to hear the the helicopter and they would run into the woods and they couldn't be they couldn't find them so what could you do I mean you could you could do the the oncology thing and just keep treating it over and over again with you know Sharpshooters but you but they were resistant so what did they do they they use what's called a judascope um they took a female goat neutered her put a radio collar on her covered her with hormones and sent her out she joined these small herds and they tracked them down and killed them and that was how they eradicated the goat population that was the extinction this is an anthropocene Extinction it's one two steps the first step was very effective but was not could not cure it there would be nice to be as rapidly uh Evolution rescue occurred the second but the small populations are highly vulnerable to Extinction and so they needed a second attack and here they used a tar a a strategy that was that was extremely effective for small populations but would never have been effective for the large populations and so this is the kind of approach that we'd like to take to develop not Curative not that cure for cancer but Curative strategies for cancer using existing um so and we have a number of uh trials going on with this and so that's just kind of how mathematics can can get involved in cancer therapy Bob that's fascinating uh yeah [Applause] I know most of you thought he was going to continue with x's and y's and equations and we LED fra to mass extinction and goats so you know that's fascinating I love the analogy and there's so many parallels to how we are treating cancer with cytotoxic chemotherapies that sort of mass level sort of sniping to now being smart and how to think about that so so Patrick I'm going to Pivot to you now uh for about 10 minutes can you talk to us some of those ideas that are coming out of your uh very uh brilliant mind there you know Bob I wish I could have taken you alongside with me when we go speak to oncologists because of that in a sort of mathematical way uh how you've been presenting it here is I've been trying to present it since 2005 when a raccoon got approved in a biological sense to the extent you know when Sanjay Gupta came over and spent about literally two years with me to try and understand what we were trying to say I said to Sanjay I'm going to on 60 Minutes raise the term it'll be completely um controversial people won't understand what I'm saying called Quantum Uncle Therapeutics and I'm going to raise a term called the temporary spatial treatment of cancer through Quantum Uncle Therapeutics now I knew that would be completely non-understandable to most people because I just made that word up just for people to think about what we're trying to do and just as you say the linear thinking what dawned on me early on in my career as a surgeon at UCLA was oh my God I think we've gone down a linear approach for treating cancer that in fact our treatment itself was inducing these resistant cells these goats are going into the hood that you were talking about we were inducing these resistant cells and because we were following rather than leading the cancers you said in the chess game by using this maximum tolerated doses of cytotic agents we were wiping out what God gave us 500 million years ago cell called the natural killer cell we have in our body a cell called the natural killer cell that came about in the Cambrian change and then evolved with Fish And involved with mammals and what is the cell in 1990 I wrote the first paper in my career about the natural killer cell as the cell it was curing cancer cell and the cell that was also killing my pancreas transplant cells and it turns out you and I we all have in our human body a cell that floats around and looks for either an infected cell or a cancerous cell and as you are sitting here today all of you are creating stem cells if you weren't creating stem cells you would not have a heart by the age of 12. so your cells need to regenerate and your genomic mathematical errors would induce a erroneous cell by by virtue of the number of cells and the only way to protect your body and recognizing yourself was this natural killer cell so the natural killer cell Evolved first through Evolution and then was followed by the T cell soon the natural killer cell and Diesel began to talk to each other and regenerated memory T cells thus evolve the concept that we could create a vaccine imagine the time that if you could create activate your natural killer cells imagine the time that you could grow your natural killer cells imagine a time it would direct the natural killer cells to a T Cell that's directed and if these cells could cross talk to each other um Not only would we be able to treat people who are the most end stage of disease about to be an hospice third line fourth line triple negative breast cancer third line fourth line Fifth Line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with hidden neck cancer Fifth Line Merkel cell carcinoma and isomized to myself then that if we went stealth for a decade and I must credit um Richard pastor and Janet Woodcock who then created this Innovation Center in oncology and I presented to them the concept that if we could orchestrate and activate your immune system with these Technologies as an outpatient without high-dose chemotherapy could we actually prove this hypothesis that you have in your body the mechanism and tools what we need is an Enlightenment at a scientific level to activate these systems and treat your cancer with this end-stage disease mid-stage disease ability disease and before you even have the disease well I'm happy to bring to to share with you tonight I think there are two doctors in the audience Dr Tara SRI Dr chaitalia Nadia who came from UC Irvine and enter Hogue and then to our Institute and they've treated now metastatic pancreatic cancer patients Senator Reed and if in my career I have had a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer with complete remission we they've treated patients with a third line fourth line triple negative breast cancer with complete remission I've treated a patient who in Santa Monica with the Mayo Santa Monica went to see designer and UCLA and was deemed Fifth Line sixth line hidden neck cancer to be ready for hospice came to our Clinic complete remission I lived for two years we had a patient come from University of Washington and Chicago with Merkel cell and a complete remission and live for five years without any evidence of disease and just passed away in 2022 of the no treatment since 2019. so what does that tell us it tells us that this hypothesis was correct that we needed to pursue this opportunity now to completely think in this complex dynamic system we can anticipate what we're doing to the tumor and it turns out the tumor acts like covet it has two things it actually has ability to spread and most importantly it has ability to suppress your immune system it has ability to hide and the opportunity to expose the tumor find it and then kill it kill it with your natural killer cells and your T cells so if that's the case then it makes complete illogical sense to bombard your body with maximum tolerated dose of chemotherapy wipe out exactly the system that you were born or to protect yourself from even getting cancer and then I'm saying we have resistant clones you have now metastatic disease and incurable I think sadly we've gone down this path and I'm excited to say um we've we've now shown first in bladder cancer with patients with failed BCG we now have a 70 complete remission rate with a three year close to three year duration of complete remission and a 90 avoidance of cystectomy and we're moving down pancreatic cancer glioblastoma hit and neck and then finally I will close by saying I'm really excited that the National Cancer Institute has now chosen how Technologies to Now launch the first cancer vaccine trial in patients with Lynch syndrome Lynch syndrome affects one in 300 Americans it is the chance of unfortunately of 80 increase in colon cancer uterine cancer and other cancers because of the genetic deficiency we will also soon launch the first cancer vaccine prevention in patients with human papillomavirus which is an oncogenic virus generates head and neck cancer and other cancers so I think finally presumed as President Nixon was saying but the long game is the integration of Immunology so with the crossover of immunology and oncology and Mathematics in first principles and understanding that the science of chaos actually so when I took on the Large Hadron Collider when the search was for God's particle I surmised that cancer is that the Collision of multiple protein protein interactions and if we can actually outsmart that understand that and outgess it and I predict where the cancer is going predict what our treatment is actually doing to the patient we have a chance of winning and I feel very excited that we are on that precipice and it I think this will be in your lifetime not after your lifetime that we'll be able to get there pretty great outstanding work [Applause] you don't know my medical history so it's hard to make that judgment yet but uh no uh so finally tomorrow a lot of interesting ideas a lot of interesting thoughts let's hear yours so let me give you a little context I'm more of a Storyteller than a science stalker things plus as you can tell my English is kind of this and that right so you know I grew up in this small town in Italy very blue color a complicated family I failed a bunch of careers I felt multiple careers in the sports which was my kind of my plan multiple careers in music and some others that I will not even tell you about and then a little bit of a miracle happened in my life that somebody had me think perhaps you can go to college nobody's ever done that in my family I said okay fine we'll go to college you see can be worse than what I'm doing right now right so did that and miracles continue to happen and I find myself in Berkeley California as a math student works out okay they like what they do they keep me for graduate program get my PhD in Espeon as a professor I said what happened it was all from the math and the physics perspective and engineering and then and then and then tragedy strikes at that point you know the miracle that had taken place was really through the hands of my wife and at that point we had three small kids and she gets sick she gets metastatic disease to lungs and liver and she dies at the age 32 like President Nixon's favorite end and at that point the reaction is natural it's in all of you it happened to me as well okay I need to know something about this roll up my sleeves and figure out a way to help fight this thing now metastatic disease to lungs and liver no matter what the origin is Remains the number one killer in oncology right we don't know what to do when that happens so it's very pure limited resource and shall I say okay so fine only problem is I don't know nothing not only about grammar but I don't know nothing about medicine and biology I'm a professor of math physics all that good stuff hey but what I study is transport how things move in other things I was working on you know the evolution of galaxies in relativistic cosmology very very applied very practical stuff every experiment is about 900 million years but you know some of the physics Remains the Same no matter what you apply it to and the math the governments that is the same so we started thinking can we figure out a way to understand how cancer works from the perspective of Transport when I put in drugs into people where do they go we talk about resistance it's almost like a magical word that means everything but are we sure that the drugs that we give to people actually get to the right places realities in the vast vast vast majority the answer is no 0.01 of the drug reject ends up in a cancer no matter what the drug is so it's a big problem going endocrine that is giving something that goes throughout the body through a circulation gives you some results but also a lot of side effects and the balance doesn't work to cure metastatic disease to lungs and liver so we kept on working with math we get to work in with the technology counterpart of that and I just wrote a book where the key chapter of that is is entitled my 30 years of failures fighting metastatic cancer to lungs and liver when a road it was last year so it was 29 but you see how the math works right next year I don't want to write another chapter so what we did first of all you know there is another miracle that I need to tell you you learn along the way right so I remarried I remarried and next thing you know I get another set of twin girls so what did we learn that God's got a great sense of humor and he's Infinite Wisdom he says sure there's got to be a signal there a message of some type so we keep on going every step of the way everything we tried did not work as you know continues to be incurable right that old family of diseases nothing worked but from every time we smashed our face against the wall something happened from it that helps not necessarily us other people pick up the pieces and figure out ways to actually make progress happen against other forms of cancer and other diseases Nano wasn't even a word when we started using particles to make to bring drugs to the right places in the body and admittedly did not cure metastatic disease but you know from the program that was set up at the National Cancer Institute where I was privileged to contribute and help with Andy and with annabarca you know dozens of drugs have come out of that something else that has happened recently anybody got vaccinated with Pfizer moderna whether you like it or not as nanoparticles in there right so you never know how science works the key is just don't stop keep on going keep on going keep on going play is a team with everybody else don't be afraid to fail don't be afraid of trying something new and different and scary I'm about to do that in a moment but I will come later and where are we with that fight right now so we developed on the math side that is all field is not become a field that is called transport oncophysics the physics of transport of drugs and cells and metabolites and everything in cancer tissue the physics the principles remain the same how do they play out phenomenological in cancer it makes a huge difference and one of the things that comes out to that if you do the math right is that again the endocrine approach puts something in the body hope it goes to the right places doesn't really work at least it doesn't for synthetic molecules so the math tells us hey you got to switch to something else then nature knew already and what's that you do things at the micro scale we call themselves you do things at the Nano scale like biological molecules figure out a way to make them work together and then you get a system that has got many many many more degrees of freedom and a greater hope if you will to fight those very forms of diseases against which right now we are powerless so that's the math the Nano that we did and that we were talking about and that that in a moment ago has given rise to a number of things that I called post Nano if you will not in the sense of postmortem in a sense of good things that happened after Nano with the lessons that we learned and right now in this company that I was talking to you about them and with the lab that I have at the University of Washington we have developed this system all these things got published in all the best journals covers of nature all of these things great but of course until you bring it to patience to me is not something that gives me any satisfaction whatsoever what we are here for is the patient as exciting as the scientists The Sciences God bless the science but what we are here for what we are here in this room for all together with the different tools that we bring to this fight is all about the patience and so I feel like a total complete failure for 29 years no matter what has happened with these pills that we started and these other things that people did fantastic God bless them I love them we are hopefully starting our first clinical trial in March of 2023 it has taken 29 years now we're in advanced stages of all the stuff you need to do before you bring a new driver to the clinic all of this safety and the manufacturing and the animal so the what is known as the pre-ind work things are not only going great things are actually disco we are discovered and stuff they changing the way I think we should be looking and some things that we consider as given pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and certain measures of toxicity if you do things right the world really changes so I am of course a perennial Optimist 29 years of failures were not enough to stop to continue hoping and we owe the hope to the people that we are here to serve that's a great privilege and so with that physics on one side not on the other side synthetic particles and curious as a way to bridge the gap that is a philosophy and I thank you very much for the opportunity to speak about this thank you [Music] so so we want to open it up to questions as well from the audience if you have one in the meantime if you put your hand up we'll get a mic to you but you know I think it's so important to keep the patient front and center and everything we're talking about whether it's mathematical molecules uh nanoparticles uh different uh theories on treatment it is how we benefit the patient I'll share one story when I was uh previously uh conducting a lot of clinical trials we we did a study in 2007 called battle and battle was a Department of Defense funded study so that's taxpayer dollars and at battlestead for a biomarker integrated approaches of targeted therapy for lung cancer elimination and the premise behind this was patients who were treated with lung cancer who had lung cancer who were treated with chemotherapy which we all know didn't work very well therapy failed those patients what would happen after the chemotherapy was given you've just given other chemotherapy and another chemotherapy you've heard some of these principles espoused tonight what we tempted to do and this was I was honored to leave this with Ki Hong was after someone had a biopsy and established a diagnosis based on the tissue and was treated with chemotherapy we wanted to do a repeat biopsy when chemo failed seems logical the cancer will change over time it's become resistant to certain Therapies 2007 we were told that it was unethical to repeat a biopsy in a person who already had a diagnosis that's how we were thinking in 2007 still so you can see how we have to continue to embrace open our Concepts up ask the patient what do they think they just got treated with chemotherapy it stopped working they see mortality in front of them they want a biopsy they want to figure out what markers exist in that cancer cell that are different than when they started and then we want to try and use that information to find the right therapy and that really we were able to open that study despite those hurdles we enrolled 254 patients in less than three years and it really set the stage for doing sequential biopsies both with tissue and with liquid now to be able to Monitor and see what changes in that tumor biology so just these little things that are holding us back we have to rethink this and so it's a critical importance so I want to ask each one of you they don't see any questions out here the one thing you would want this audience of diverse backgrounds all very interested in this battle against cancer what is one take-home message you want to give them they go home and and think about it process it as they go to the meeting tomorrow and they go on what is that message and I'm going to go reverse order here so Patrick I'm going to start with you what is that message to these folks exactly what you just said right I think one of the fallacies is that the cancer is a sort of single Colonial disease it's a multi-clone disease so glivac when it got invented was the Magic Bullet and wonderful as it was I think it set the field down the wrong path thinking that one mutation would allow then you to treat it because what happens is there's multiple mutations and one even targeted therapy would evolve to the resistance to the next one so what I concluded is one can't really kill the cancer from the inside out actually you gotta kill it from the outside in you've got to take a macro approach to kill it from the outside in and the reason you can't kill it from the outside in is because it hides it evades meaning it moves away from the T cell receptors it moves away from being exposing what it comes perceived as an abnormal cell yet once it moves away from a T Cell receptor and these checkpoints that everybody now follows it actually opens itself to the natural killer cell so the takeaway message is that if you can orchestrate in a temporal logical way your natural killer cell your dendritic cell your M1 macrophage and drive to what we call a memory T cell and memory natural killer cell and then suppress the suppressors so you have a multitude chess game you got to suppress the suppressors activate the activators and then induce memory we will be able to as an outpatient therapy with the quality of life drive at least initially High long-term durable complete remissions then I think we get to the Cure because we understand therefore the biology of this disease in this mathematical complex Dynamics system and then drive vaccines because we know both in our pre-clinical work that we can actually train your body to keep memory T cells in memory and K cells deep into your bone marrow and ready for if a resistant cell emerges so the the message I'd like to give is that we have in our human body god-given gifts and all we need to do is understand them and activate them in a biologically scientific way and I think we on that precipice right now and that's what we're doing at immunity bio however in order to do this it is so imperative to do this in randomized controlled trials in institutions such as yours as well as institutions in the local community because cancer is a local community disease and we can actually drive this therapy not to these Ivory Towers so to speak look I come from Academia but we really need to drive these kinds of therapies into the hands of the local community oncologists and we need to have oncologists understand immunology and I think we have that capacity today and that's the message is we can change the Paradigm of cancer and instead of the hiding it we can find it instead of invading we can actually track it down and instead of killing our immune system we can kill the cancer so I call it find it killed it and it's as simple as that I expose it find it kill it and um sadly I think all these infectious diseases follow the same track the virus has an ability to evade your immune system and if we can find a way to kill the infected cell as opposed to blocked virus we have a way of actually ridding ourselves just like we've done with hepatitis sooner can do for HIV and a full lung covet thank you Patrick Bob briefly what is this summary statement tonight for our audience well I think when I started working in cancer I got the feeling the oncologist that they viewed cancerism as magic as an evil entity as some kind of Otherworldly process that occurs and when I first wrote down mathematical models of it I realized that it was it was an enormous relief that I that I understood that it's not magic it's not an evil entity it's just a bunch of cells that have to obey the rules of living systems like all women the rules of evolution like all living systems we know those rules we can understand those rules we can kill this disease I think we we have the tools to do it great thank you Bob Morrow what is cancer oh my God cancer is a disease of mass transport dysregulation it's a systemic disease of mass transport imbalance at multiple levels from the organ to the various you know some tissues and compartments to the cell and under dimensionally speaking so it's a transport disease it may be triggered locally but this is systemic disease the Cascade or no the genetic genomic instability Cascade that characterizes cancer is a response to the systemic nature of the disease is the body trying to fix things up because distribution of mass is not following what it is supposed to do in health these Transformations happen true these imbalances happen through modifications of the traffic barriers the government traffic inside of the body what we call the biological barriers and these are again at the cell level like cell membrane subcellular level the various organelles inside the transport mechanism of the cell the tissue around the organ level the entire organismal level is our biological barriers are modified in carcinogenesis that determines what's goes where and how quickly and how much so I think the strategy that may be of interest that I'm hoping that I bet my whole life on is that we can design therapeutic agents that are focused on this ever very in portrait and poor profile of these biological barriers is the modified in the body if we need to do that the model for doing that is what happens in the immune system with the interplay of micro scale objects and nanoscale objects and the only way to get the balance right is Through Math I'm gonna I'm gonna tell my son that tonight when he's studying um tonight right thank you it's a nightmare so I I will just say that it's so important to remember everything we've talked about tonight the patient that person is our most precious resource that's where we learn and that each person has an individual aspect and what type of cancer what type of predisposition what happens each person is a unique individual and we have to figure out using these types of models how we can best approach each individual person and tailor a therapy as well as a survivorship program because we're going to cure everybody and remember cure stands for you know can you reimagine everything and I think this panel gives you that you know that type tone tonight so thank you all to our distinguished panelists we really appreciate your expertise thank you all tonight we'll go ahead and close the program thank you

conference we'll explore the intersections and applications between technology and medicine as both Fields continue to evolve and Advance rapidly a successful pairing of the two could lead to promising and indeed revolutionary results stanbridge University is an award-winning Health Care focused system and a leading innovator in edtech the first to introduce the use of synthetic cadavers on the west coast and large-scale virtual reality in foundational science training it is leading efforts on the use of AI enabled social robots in a variety of Pediatric Therapy treatment settings it's now my pleasure to introduce yase President of stanbridge University to introduce our final program [Applause] thank you president Byron good afternoon ladies and gentlemen would you please join me in recognizing the youngest president of the Nixon Foundation an accomplished orator and his talented staff for their hard work in successfully hosting a very successful second annual Nixon Kansas Summit [Applause] to introduce our final panel I thought I would hark him back to a panelist in our beginning panel last evening Dr Ferrari a mathematician a physician and a musician may I say extraordinaire who brought Humanity to a room full of science with his excellent singing Talent his words struck a chord when in describing the trait he thought captures best capture is a predicate of success he said it's those who have grit and resilience and the ability to rise from failure and pursue their dreams again and again and in the race for a cure for cancer he said that resilience and grit was driven by human moments perhaps the illness or the passing of a loved one he reminded me of another mathematician John Nash who was immortalized by Hollywood in the movie A Beautiful Mind in his penultimate moment receiving the Abel prize he said that for all of his journeys in math and science it all came down to human moments and love so to introduce the moderator of a distinguished panel of Physicians and scientists who would speak about the latest in technology and medicine I thought I would skip reading his extraordinary list of accomplishments and simply ask him two questions as an introduction as a member of The Healing Arts profession and physician what was a seminal human moment that he remembers and Dr pister's answered that it was over a decade ago when he had a patient who presented to him a Jehovah's witness that had been rejected by all surgeons previously and had no hope and he said he and his team took on the patient at MD Anderson and he said that after a 14-hour operation that successful surgery is one such human moment for him and as a second question and a segue to the panel today I asked him what technology he thought would move the needle in medicine in the days ahead to which he replied very carefully that it is all of the different chords of artificial intelligence and data science that he believes where we have hiding in the freezers and the servers today the answers that data science and AI could unlock answers for the future please join me in welcoming a distinguished American teacher surgeon and accomplished leading Medicine Dr pistis who'll introduce his panel [Applause] uh thank you very much um as usual we've saved the best for last and this is an opportunity for us to come together for an outstanding panel discussion and so with me immediately to my left is my my good friend and fellow surgeon Bill kantz who's a research scientist at Grail and has a long-standing history with the American Cancer Society as well as outstanding service in a number of different academic Medical Center environments Bill do you want to say a little bit more about your background and your current role and then we'll go to the other two panelists sure so as as Peter said I've I've done cancer surgery and cancer research my entire career kind of trying to bridge the the aspects between the lab and the patient and and back uh so as as I've moved forward working on Invasion metastasis during the career studying focal he's in kinase as a central molecule is uh as I went through I realized I wanted to to get to the next level of how of where we're going to be going where's the field taking us I went to the American Cancer Society and I met the the my colleagues at Grail shortly thereafter worked with them for for several years impressed with the the depth of their science the commitment to science and saw how how the early detection is so critical to the next phase of what we do and how technology is going to be such a big a big part of that so delighted to be here with you all and join the panel thanks thank you now to our virtual teammates uh David Angus is founding director and CEO of the Lawrence Ellison Institute for transformative medicine and a CBS physician I believe so Dr August can you tell us a little bit more about yourself do not describe yourself as a just a medical oncologist but give us some insights into where you sit right now at the interface of technology and Medicine apologize um uh now you can hear me I am a medical oncologist and you figure after three years of Zoom I would be better at that and I apologize um and it really goes to the fact I focus on using a technology for disease and I can't use technology to speak so it's a um uh we had an Institute that cares for patients I had a full day clinic today um and as well develops Therapeutics and Technologies to benefit patients and I also chair the global Health security Consortium or co-chair um so we do something on a global basis again to try to understand how to better disseminate the advances we have in cancer to people across the globe I'm a believer that many of the answers are going to come on the data side and that we really hit a lot on the biology side already and the real challenge now is to look at our outliers whether it be the amazing responder or the person who doesn't respond at all and from these outliers understand what's better my field has been very good at the mean historically now we have to widen our view thanks so much David and then finally Dr Pang who comes to us as a physician and a researcher and director of product development at Beverly thanks so much for joining us give us a little more background about where you sit right now and a little bit about the company yeah thank you for having me um uh so my name is Lily Peng I am a director of product management at fairly I'm actually a little new to this role I just started about like a month ago and a lot of bulk my work actually was done at the sister company uh Google you may have heard of them uh and a lot of my world there was to apply AI to healthcare um on a research side and what that meant was you know there's a saying you know it wouldn't be called research if we knew what we were doing so a lot of that is actually learning from a lot of failures and learning not only about how to apply technology to the healthcare space but how do we translate that technology into the real world into real world impact for patients and one of the reasons behind my move to verily is that a focus on building those products and accelerating the translational piece because um you know what I've noticed from you know my eight or so years of just working with the Google team is I you know we train models every day you know your phone you can you can like type in the name of your dog and you can find your dog so AI is powering consumer experiences all the time helping consumers and participants patients all right all the time and so how do we accelerate that translation into the healthcare space um and you know not to give things away but having great data I think is a big piece of it and I know that we're talk we're looking I'm looking forward to talking about that a lot more let's open up the discussion probably start with you Lily really looking at the reality of how ready is health care for artificial intelligence we see it in all of our daily lives with Siri with Alexa with other aspects of autonomous driving to give another example is Healthcare ready for AI or what are the limitations that you see about deploying AI for patient care or for Predictive Analytics yeah um you know I feel like we are both so ready like we were we we need this yesterday type already but also so far out um and what I mean is we have seen um lots of real promise and applicability on the research side right you you um I used to work a lot in applying AI to Medical Imaging right and we all we show how well AI can actually handle images and actually give you really insightful great insights from from images um gray for wrote tasks of which we have a lot in medicine um but then I think the process of Translating that technology into real world's impact means generating evidence this is not like a consumer space right like if the product malfunctions people there are real consequences right real harm done to patients and so we need to generate evidence that whatever technology we have whether it's AI enabled or not is effective and so you know the need is there there's clear demonstration but the translational past I think is not quite there it's not fast enough I mean it's there but it doesn't handle the volume and the Cadence that we can improve oh my gosh Healthcare it got really dark really quickly technology just decided that I did not was not in this room um anyway so let me just finish that part and um and to say that like the the process of translation is I think where we need to um actually put in a lot of muscle uh and so it's less about AI itself and it's about the process of translating Technologies period great Point um Alexa turn on the lights um um David um your thoughts about that we just turned on my Alexa [Laughter] we could see how well it works um if we unpack a couple of the use cases um that Lily was pointing out a pattern recognition if we can really have YouTube find videos with cats in them why can we not really readily deploy AI methodologies or machine learning for radiology interpretation or pathology interpretation these are fields of medicine associated with pattern recognition yeah I mean the bottom line is no offense I don't care about Radiology pathology interpretation I care about improved patient care right I mean that's going to be the key thing with all of them that's the killer app if you will and so the problem is is that we don't have structured data electronic health records are a bag of words um and to nobody's fault that's how where they were developed a long time ago and they really haven't changed the underlying technology and so bags of words are hard to put and create and just structured data and you need structured data in order to develop Insight with machine learning or artificial intelligence I will tell you that we all know right some doctors are great some doctors are good and some doctors are average right there you know the way that distinguishes a grade and an average is better pattern recognition I tell you I look under the microscope you know at all of my patient slides and I can tell even though that you know the the pathology says this it's going to be more aggressive than they say and it's just pattern recognition so if that's the case I know machine learning AI can do it better than me and can make every doctor great in this country you know we talk about making new advances in biology and new drugs I really believe if we can develop structured data across the country with electronic health records and with AI we can equal care across the country and we will probably save orders of magnitude more lives than if we developed a half a dozen new Therapeutics and it will be orders of magnitude cheaper so that's going to be the goal now and I think there's going to be a transition you know remember it was a feature not a bug of electronic health records that you couldn't get data out of them that has to change every patient is in charge of their own health care data it's not their doctor's data it's not the institution's data it's a strange artifact that we strike data by institution why is there the Mayo Clinic data set the MD Anderson data set that makes no sense there's the United States of America data set and when you think like that we can then start to have structured data where we will all benefit if I said Hey listen give me all your credit card records give me you know all of your you know Financial records they'll consider giving you a home loan you do even though you don't know who I am if I say let me use your health care data as in a privacy protected way right now people say oh it's my health care we have to change that attitude together with the structured data we can radically improve health care I'm going to ask you one follow-up question before I go to bill because you're you're really hitting on the key point we have poor quality Source data we have bags of words what is the strategy for moving to structured data in individual institutions or medical practices or at large scale um there is no code and strategy is the bottom answer um and so but I do think you're going to start to see organizations like CMS require more structured data for reimbursement I think we saw it at the FDA it was the first Federal agency to require standard data elements for a submission and that was fantastic at the time I think you're going to see the electronic Healthcare Company Cerner epic and others or is going to start to convert from this Legacy software which is literally like MS-DOS from the 90s or Windows 95 to Modern software in the cloud we will have standard data elements and structured data I think it's going to be a new Revolution we saw it with Oracle and obviously on you know Larry Ellison is a big donor to my Institute in all full disclosure that being said Oracle buying Cerner I think was an enormous step forward and you're going to start to see you know advances now where data is going to be freely shared and we're going to have the ability to really make an impact you can imagine every academic every person in a company who works machine learning AI is dreaming of getting structured Healthcare data to make an impact and is going to happen we can really see it and just to give you the the MD Anderson example in terms of what we're doing is moving to synoptic reporting for radiology reports for operative notes and for pathology reports and if we can put those data sets into synoptic format by still allowing a radiologist for example some freedom to dictate free text but key elements recorded synoptically we have a way in which we can use that for research purposes is what we refer to internally as a first mile data strategy rather than a Last Mile data strategy most of us are familiar with that strategy but I showed that strategy that you were doing to a bunch of Silicon Valley guys and and girls and the first thing they said is this is amazing why didn't they do it 20 years ago that's because we had too much freedom and too much autonomy and no Focus really on how to provide high quality first mile data and a Reliance on what you would describe as Last Mile data strategy that we all knew as medical students and fellows okay let's get into Diagnostics um Grail a blood test to diagnose cancer this is something that we've all been looking forward to the opportunity to avoid a bowel prep on a colonoscopy I know is something that's on my to-do list so help us to understand uh what the technology is and what the science is behind this sure so let's this sort of level set first what's the why behind that why do we need to have early detection 70 of the can't of the cancer deaths in the United States are from cancers where there's no screening test 70 percent and when you look at the numbers at demographics the Baby Boomers aging we know that risk age is one of the biggest risks for cancer uh it's it's overwhelming ten thousand Baby Boomers turned 65 every day so we have individual screening tests that we've been using that aren't sustainable so we really need to move to screening individuals for cancer rather than individual screening tests so that's the why behind the early detection so how did this actually start kind of it's an intriguing story uh a scientist at Illumina was looking at cell free DNA in the blood of pregnant woman women and looking for for abnormalities in a fetus that could be detected from the the fetal DNA and she found tumor DNA in some of the mothers and they go whoa that's and then people are right yeah prove it every one of those women had cancer so she found circulating tumor DNA cell free DNA so so it was the the idea that tumors themselves are shedding DNA when they set up shot in someone's body so now it's about oh in 2016 when Grail spun out and the the technology is not just sequencing DNA and we've heard a lot about DNA and uh we've heard a lot about regulation and so forth we have to get Beyond just DNA sequence and mutations and look at how that DNA is regulated how is it turned on and and it's methylated that's what switches on individual genes the DNA methylation it's transcriptional control and so forth so the first piece is actually sequencing the methylated DNA in a blood sample that's the first part of the technology it's called bisulfite sequencing but you can sequence these little Islands and we sequence about 1.1 million in every sample 1.1 million so there's a technological Advance right there how many of you all remember manual sequencing how many ever poured a manual sequencing gel yeah you know where you had catg your fingers were catg and you're entering in the computer 1.1 million so so how do we analyze that and that's where the AI comes in so we've been able to define a common cancer signal that's over at least 50 cancers through AI machine learning of the that uh the the methylated DNA and we can also by looking at specific cpg Islands tell the cancer site of origin and over 90 percent of the cases to allow directed workup of the positive tests so that's a technology we've we've we're uh we have over 330 000 people that have had the test in clinical trials so very deep research commitment over 50 000 have taken it commercially because it's been available now for a little over a year um just to just quickly to tell the the finals where the latest results which we presented at the European Society of medical oncology in September this was a study we called Pathfinder about 7 000 people were enrolled to see how it was implemented that was the end point the implementation so here are the three things we doubled the number of cancers detected from just ordinary screening so we doubled it and 70 percent were those that didn't have screens two they were deadly cancers there's some worry of oh you're picking up these cancers that will never matter no these are deadly cancers pancreas liver endometrial osteosarcoma had a knack and about 50 were stage one and two so our key is that we want to see across all all development of multi-cance early detection we want to see that stage shift to earlier stages so that's in a nutshell but I spend a lot of my time on the data piece I mean how can we link the data such a critical piece of getting real world data that's regulatory grade for the FDA David um your thoughts about this I know that you take care of patients how do you think patients are going to perceive this and what are the limitations of this in a situation where we're rolling out a test where we're trying to Define using real world evidence false positive false negatives and at the same time work on the coverage issues the science is interesting it's still nascent it has a ways to go and I think that's the hard part now yes it is available to patients who are rich who can buy it and what I've seen are things that can be scary I have a dozen patients that have had significance operations or procedures that probably didn't need it you know there's one argument that stage one cancers will always be stage one cancers you have to show that finding these early matters and I think that's very difficult in many regards rather than have life-altering surgery at the same time you know when you take a hundred people with known cancer in only a small fraction will turn positive on the test so many people take the test don't go to other screenings and end up we've seen several with metastatic disease because they were quote false negatives on the test and so I think it's very difficult that's not a fault of the test per se it's a fault of the people who do it who are doctors who have no idea what it is because it's being sold by Community docs basically and they don't know how to have truly give informed consent to the patients to understand what they're going through and so the notion of having a nascent test that hasn't been shown to affect outcome available to people who can afford it to me doesn't make a lot of sense that is being misused in that regard that's not to say it won't work it won't be a fantastic advantage in the future but we really have to do the studies first before you put that out there and really cause tremendous stress or potentially tremendous procedures in an individual patient and David those are great points I mean we do not want this test to cause undue psychological anxiety and of course we don't want unnecessary procedures and and that's not and we haven't seen a lot of that let's look at the data for of what we have seen so far the false positive rate is 0.5 percent so five out of every thousand tests and the positive predictive value is 43 so if the if the odds of having cancer if with a positive test are 43 percent then in context with mammogram lung CT they're well under 10 5 to 7 percent so so we're we're we have looked even at the people with false positives we've done patient reported outcomes in the trial I just mentioned and over 80 percent even with the false positives over 80 percent of them are satisfied and felt that that is that the anxiety level was was not not uh excessive to your point about trials absolutely uh we recently finished enrolling the at the NHS Gallery trial uh the National Health Service in the United Kingdom we enrolled 140 000 patients in 10 months fastest enrolling trial clinical trial in history it was faster than the the napoleo vaccine trial so those are and it's a randomized trial so people got blood drawn but it's randomized who got the test who got gallery and who did not so those results will be coming I think you make a good point that we do the vaccine trial enrolled 120 000 patients in three months so well the points well point is is well taken but it wasn't a cancer trial maybe well neither was polio so good point Lily what are your thoughts here about how to integrate the data science um with the technology really enjoying this uh and I think you know at the end of the day one piece that you know I hear in that's that's both a pain point for both people who are developing these Innovative Technologies and participate or patients that could benefit but also could be harmed is that really we don't have a way to generate evidence nearly rapidly enough um to show whether or not hey you know overall because every time you take a test there's always that risk of false positive and false negative right it's always this risk that you have to take and without the right data you're not able to really you know inform that decision and then there's a big difference between how things are run in the pristine condition of a clinical trial where you have all of those support right in monitoring and all that and then what happens in the real world where you have folks that are not as well well informed about the test even clinicians right and then also patients who are also not well as well informed do not have as much support um so I think there's two pieces one is how do we rapidly turn generate evidence the NHS is a great place because of all these all the integrated you know I mean it's still one system and yes they're different systems but they can integrate and talk to each other and that's why you know with the covid work um they were some of the first to find out about you know therapies that worked right like Dex Ambassador Zone worked and they were able to do things rapidly because they were able to merge research and Care together and that's one piece and then the other piece is like practically how do things play out in the real world and I think the framework is actually thinking about those different types of ways that you are gathering data and how do we make sense of all of that and gain insights from all of that actually answered your question but but these big themes I think it's worth kind of highlighting around these two different areas where I think we need to do more investment excellent points a couple things I want to drill down on a little bit the first you alluded to and that's the role of patience how can their voices be incorporated into the generation of solutions here and what David I think accurately describes his use of their data Lily what are your thoughts there yeah I think um this is a key piece and I think um you know the people focus on other folks on the panel are very alluded to this is that you know participants or patients um you know we keep screening for like you know this type of cancer or that type of cancer right it's like well I'm at risk for all kinds of cancer right well maybe not prostate um but you know I'm at risk for all of these kinds of cancers like how do we you know screen people for the thing that they care about they care that they don't get cancer period or that that's found early period right so I think that's one interesting super interesting concept another concept is that patience um generate lots of data outside of care and outside of research right how do we capture those experiences right um and and also how do we capture um the the experience of going through a therapy so uh let's say I'm on a drug antidepressant um and you know I'm actually losing sleep and sleep is actually really important to everything else but we don't know this because we're not actually measuring the thing like you don't measure sleep in a care episode in a visit in a patient visit right um so how do we measure all of these things that contribute to well-being for a patient um and I think all of this in order to do this uh their needs well okay now I have a kind of a little stronger opinion which is there needs to be um the ownership the data needs to centralize around the patient right because they are the connection points for all of these different sources uh whether they are a Mayo patient for a certain period of time or you know Sloan Kettering for another time they are that Central organizing Force for all of it I understand why it's so hard to do that because the patient itself like the patient himself rehearsal they don't have an I.T team like like Mayo does to build a system that's organized around them um but I think technology has made it possible that like you have a Google account you have a Facebook account we actually do centralize around the consumer or the user or the patient so it is possible we just have to figure out how to implement in the right way and then we also need the other stakeholders um you know to buy in right because like it's incomplete if we don't get the care data it's incomplete if we don't get you know if you're in a trial you know the covert trial that data so so I think I think we need to agree that the patient matters the person matters um and that we need to try to get more and more people who believe in this and to join in I don't think everyone will agree all at once I don't think that's that's pretty quick Sonic I think you have to convince people to join over time sounds like a religion it is it's a bit of a cult you gotta believe it and if you believe it it might just happen you know during covid we were part of a team that developed a a program called vsafe where every person in the country had the opportunity of clicking on a QR code and entering the side effects they felt that data would enabled us to have data on pregnant women breastfeeding women who were excluded from the clinical trial and so several months after launch of the vaccine we were able to get FDA approval for them from this and it's really the first time that we collected data after a drug or a therapy or vaccine in this case was approved by the FDA the notion that clinical trials stopped when they stop arbitrarily at a certain buy Point makes no sense in the oncology World 60 to 70 percent of the drugs we use are quote off label um and we don't collect any data so the idea that real world evidence is inferior to stuff on a clinical trial again is something that has to change every patient should be given the opportunity of being part of the Cure or a way of improving the treatment for a disease how do you get the health systems to buy in fact [Music] it should be the patients and that's the point um that's it should be that is exactly right but that's not the way it plays out is as you try to get real world data it's like no you can't have the data can we you know can a patient do exactly what you described with a gallery test no they can't uh because the systems will not let that happen in some cases so I think that because it's the here's it's our data so how are we going to get passed out because that's such a critical component to the real world we have to be able to look to you know to to see that real world implementation and what happens we have to get those data I totally agree but it's hard it's I spent I think it's it's harder than doing the AI to be honest with you David your your thoughts on how to optimally integrate patients I think we agree on the notional concept that the data belong to patients but how do we help them to understand that and how can they opt out in the future or from specific uses of their data you know there's this ruling that came about called HIPAA the health insurance portability act sounds very sexy if you think about it it's like taking a suitcase somewhere um but in reality you know it was meant to protect the the safety of patients and the Integrity of their data unfortunately it's been interpreted it's not the law but it's the interpretation of a native hospitals doctor oh you typical we can't touch the data we can't play with that data and I think there really needs to be a new sense a patient Bill of Rights um and I think at some point we have to go that direction the patient has a right to their data the patient has a right to be part of research to be part of research extra institutions so it's not just at that hospital or that institution they're at and I think that's where things are going you're going to see it you know the UK is the worst example there is right in the UK the hospital does it on the data the National Health Service doesn't own the data the individual general practitioner owns the patient data and it's a Remnant something from 25 years ago and that has to change because it literally makes no sense that individual practitioner can sell their patients data but the patient can't have access to their data that's not right and so I do think we're going to evolve to a point and I think there are a lot of meetings coming up where we're going to get toward this patient Bill of Rights and it has to happen technology has given us the ability and it's really an inflection point right we now have the cloud to store things which is remarkably secure we have the ability of privacy protecting the data like we never have before so technology is going to enable us to liberate this data to have it used for public good without getting into too much detail on the technology do you see like cloud-based Solutions or blockchain technology as ways in which individuals can retain ownership of their data or control of their data in ways maybe that they don't imagine today I have two words for that answer hell yes um you know if you look at it right now right my hospital I'm not going to say which one we're affiliated with is a small hospital it's got some I.T people who are really well-meaning but no offense they're not very good and you think they have the ability of protecting their patients data how many hospitals have had Ransom you know payments this year because somebody has taken over their data once you transition to the cloud and have literally the top Security Experts in the world maintaining our health care data it's going to be much more secure than it is now and Technologies whether they be blockchain or other technology that enable you to have custody of your data from multiple sources are available today and will be implemented hopefully in the next year or so I hope Grand scale foreign terrific I want to move to the talent dependency associated with this future State we've heard in the course of this conference how mathematics and biology are being merged computational biology is really a field biologic phenomenon can be described by mathematical equations we are competing for talent with industry and with other sectors and we can't at least on the provider side we can't compensate at levels that attract data scientists they get paid millions of dollars at Google so what are the solutions that we have to attract the talent beyond the mission um we don't barely has set up a fund to subsidize hospitals paying for their Ai and their machine learning people right foreign did we decide that just a moment ago you had a critically important Point you're right human capital is required for all of these things and unfortunately the draw of Silicon Valley has been tremendous on many of that Capital what I'm seeing now which to me is one of the great positives of covid-19 is people are leaning toward meaningful work whether it be working on a health project at verily or Google or welcoming working at an MD Anderson is more attractive than working on selling a widget or figuring out which movie you're going to choose next and I have seen in the last year when we would have positions we would have one applicant now we have hundreds all of whom are tremendous and that's a big change that happened toward the end of kova 19 that this new generation wants meaningful work or meaningful applications for their work can you agree with that we're absolutely seeing that that people are seeking purpose and meaning in their work and we see the same thing as people come to us because of data Science Institute and oncology that kind of work and they are tired of writing algorithms to sell more socks or refrigerators they want to unlock a lot of the Mysteries that are hiding on our inside our freezers and on our servers right now exactly and there's a point mentioned earlier today about more effective interactions with industry and I think that that Academia can do that having come from Academia and now in Industry there's a lot of opportunities and in order for us to scale academic Discovery we're going to have to be in Industry so it it so I think trying to get that Continuum more set is will will help get us more training because it's a critical need that you just mentioned lily as you look at that and that was such an excellent point that I completely agree with the partnership between academic institutions and Industry as an industry person how do you see that right now and what are the ways in which you could choose an academic partner I think so we um we well in my old role we worked with academic Partners all the time I think you know one of the things that when you're trying to do a research project in particular is that if you're not working with the end users and the clinicians and their patients you're going to run off in the wrong direction pretty easily and it's a huge waste of time and those large salaries I suppose um because you solved the wrong problem right like Health Care is non-intuitive and so that partnership between Academia and medical centers and Industry I think is is really critically important I think another place that has been really great for us is as we are partnering with people um it's actually you know there are folks that we can actually train and help um gain the new skills I would say to do a lot of the things that the computer scientists and the other folks here can do you don't need a Google computer scientist to train tensorflow models right um that is tensorflow slip flow and as well as other competitors are open source they're high school students that can actually train the models so the model training isn't the actually the hard part anymore it's the data underneath and the labels underneath right and so if we can get that piece right all the other things become much easier and you have a lot more people that can help you with that um but the data piece like I joke that like 80 of my old team and actually probably my new team is cleaning up the data right because it's just in these like we get them from hard drives they get mailed in and it doesn't make sense so so I think that's the big big piece where we if we enable we if we reduce the amount of almost manual labor that is required to implement Technologies we just make it easier for everyone and that iteration speed will compound if we can get that infrastructure piece right so I think it's not as hard as we think it is to get people who can build AI it's way harder to get the data right now I think you're totally right I mean what's Wild is this happened before right is that people who worked in the lab and the clinic never talk to each other then all of a sudden translational programs that happened at hospitals like MD Anderson and others we're able to get things very quickly from the lab to the clinic now the people who collect the data and Industry need to be one team we're all fighting the same freaking disease so it is a nonsense that they're not on the same Zoom calls in today's world not talking together um did the sun just set where you are or something or you were too still and the lights went off New Era and I think we have to get over this notion that there's the Dark Side which is industry and there's the academic side we're all one and you know without industry you have no new drugs or treatment for disease without academics and hospitals you have no samples and data of which to develop them so the two are necessary for each other to succeed such a great point because um we know that you need the clinicians on the front lines to define the use cases as opposed to Industry to work in a vacuum in a silo and present the solutions that was the problem with IBM Watson that was the solution uh trying to find a problem and it didn't work for a lot of good reasons because people in the clinic were never involved at the Inception and in the design and if we can find ways to deepen the connection and refine the use cases and solve for the problems that the patients are experiencing will all be a lot better and will move faster farther quicker um to come back to the data dependency and the talent dependency these are two really important points because we have poor quality data we have what David describes as bags of words we have data scientists that come to institutions and spend 80 percent of their time cleaning up the data and 20 of their time analyzing the data we have a lot of work to do on the quality of data or the data supply chain so that we can give data scientists clean data all the time and reverse the time allocation that they spend at the moment put them 80 percent of the time on analyzing the data and twenty percent of the time cleaning it up on the talent dependency I'm just wondering from the two of you David and Lily if we need to go down to medical school training where we don't really have tracks and when bioinformatics is an old field that isn't quite what we're talking about today and where we have to inspire young people who are thinking about a career medicine and then Mary data science in the ways in which we had biomedical science fused with medical training is that an opportunity that we're missing out on right now in medical schools David again two words hell yes no question about it you know my son is a first year medical student and you know I I look and it's almost embarrassing watching don't tell him I said this but you know they're learning to memorize he's doing infectious disease now and he's memorizing every bug in antibiotics you've got this little device where he can Google that and then you know use his brain for processing things and thinking about things and learning bioinformatics Better Learning statistics learning how to structure data that's where we need to put the emphasis we teach toward tests we have these things called boards medical schools get graded on how well their students do on the boards which has nothing to do with taking care of patients do you want a doctor who can memorize things really well or do you want a doctor who can talk is empathetic and can think and process I'd certainly rather the latter well we could get out to a tangent or a pathway here that's super important but I'm completely aligned with your thinking we have old school methodology anchored in the last Millennium that's based on organic chemistry and MCAT testing to bring people into medical school we do not screen for compassion and empathy or communication skills if we had emotional intelligence as a Criterion that we selected for you would get a totally different kind of medical student and if you accepted the reality everything that medical students need to know which used to be in textbooks and required memorization is now on an iPhone and you simply need to know how to curate and cultivate information that you can pull up on an iPhone and test people for the ability to explain that in plain language to patients that's really a totally different way of thinking about medical education and the thing that's holding us back is exactly what you pointed out it's test scores in U.S news and World Report ranking you know I do autopsies on all my patients who pass away from cancer and I learned a tremendous impact I have a feedback where Brad I thought it was scar tissue and the long internet to be cancer I couldn't understand why there was short of breath and there's a single layer of cancer cells circuit in their alveoli and their lung they can't get oxygen in I learned so much from it but we've lost all those things right we've moved to the pure uh knowledge where we just want to say what is the answer how can I Google it and get to that we need to go back to the art of it and learn it and then you need to understand what that data really is you know we don't have standards for the data Lily calls it a fractured leg I call it a broken leg Cinema how much we try to harmonize our database they may be a little bit off and going back to the the education I think we how we communicate with patients and the need for specific Communications like we heard from Rob went I mean we we have to be able to taught to be to teach our students the empathy to getting trusted Messengers into the right communities to educate about new technologies and because if if we're going to implement these new technologies we need to really have those discussions about what are the pros what are the cons and how we we can see that that this is for the greater good and and I think and we're getting that law getting that's being lost with the test scores and the rankings no question one other area that I want to drill down into relates to the use of algorithms in clinical medicine and one of the areas of course that we've looked at is the identification of patients who have sepsis in the hospital and as these algorithms have been deployed we've uncovered a new field that's referred to as algorithm bias where algorithms that are developed in in one institution or by one group of researchers on one small subset of patients don't appear to work very well when they're applied in other settings um Lily what are your thoughts on how we can avoid that because it has a lot of implications to how we develop the algorithms oh absolutely and I hate to sound like a broken record but you know it's real world data in Connected systems I think you know um there's this concept of like post-market monitoring right um and for devices and algorithms and algorithms are sort of basically software as a medical device right um there's opportunity to actually be looking at how they perform even after approval um and these are all like these devices actually you know they're served maybe through a cloud-based but you know but they're connected they can be connected and you can actually get real time or near real-time analysis on how things are going so instead of relying on an adverse event you know like a post-market surveillance which is when an adverse event happens and then you report and it takes forever and then you respond you can actually see hot spots where there are deviations from performance right um so I think there's two to answer the question actually more comprehensively there are multiple multiple ways of dealing with bias the first one is before you know even build a product right you're actually doing the work in the communities where you want to deploy this algorithm your training your training data represents a wide variety of participants and and what they go through to actually access care um and so from the design aspect you can actually prevent some of this stuff from happening also on the design side you can actually start looking out for where to look right once the algorithm is deployed if you're going to monitor you actually have to know where to look you can't search for everything there's nothing no such thing right and so if you notice that hey you know older folks tend to struggle or have worse results with this algorithm you actually put that in the design of the product and you say post Market we're going to be watching this one very carefully right and in fact every time we go to a new site we go live there we're going to increase monitoring and then so that we can respond if we need to right so the there are when you want to get that post market and the continuous monitoring right you have to design for it from the beginning so I think we have to think about it as a Continuum but that last piece about looking at how a product actually performs in the real world when it's used off label on a different population that it was originally intended that is what happens in real life and we need data on that right now and we can we shouldn't ignore that data so I think it's really great and I think the problem though is how do we incentivize manufacturers like industry to do that right because it I think the great part of some of this stuff is that if you're able to get that data about off-label use you could maybe expand your indications right so there is there are win-win situations here we just need to prove those Paces out and make it clear what the win-win is for everyone in the situation obviously um the patient you know for for the as a main stakeholder but also um everyone else that's involved I agree with everything you said Lily the one thing I would add is just transparency and the root data um that it's very important that you're very transparent to what the data was you made your algorithm or your decision upon so others can say does my patient fit that data set yes absolutely there are these things called Model cards sorry to interrupt but they're model cards it's kind of the nutrition facts of of the model right like you know what what went in there so that you can also make decisions there so that's a really good point and the final thing I agree with everything the final thing I would add would be simplicity so when when it you're getting the post-market data how can you get the data easily simply without clinical trials or this how do we get that in I think that's a challenge for us being able to get that and have it be regulatory grade great points superb discussion let's go to the audience for audience questions now good afternoon Chris Stewart um a retired social behavioral scientist and have dealt with many of these same issues on DARPA programs um of cleaning munging data and you know the the limitations the fundamental limitations that we have in this area because of um not being able to use common data sets and I guess one of the questions is and I I was at a National Academy session I don't know four or five years ago and really eye-opening when we were talking about the genetic testing and obviously the costs going down but it wasn't really until we hit 700 000 cases that we begin to see the right kinds of patterns to begin to understand the genetic code now we've realized long long read sequencings more important or you know as valuable we've also realized junk DNA is important to look at in between and the the implications there so I guess one of the questions is how are we going to do the power analysis how are we going to get to the numbers to crack the code that we need to do because I I know from a trust framework standpoint that patients aren't going to be willing to share their data in the volumes that we want and I worked on Dynamic consent I've worked on those sorts of issues and it's not it is a wicked problem terrific question I guess I'll go Lily to you for the thoughts on on this how do we get to critical mass with high quality data so we can get to exit velocity here yeah oh such a good question and such a hard problem um and thank you thank you for asking it I think and thank you for um you know I think there are there are two ways that I would think about this the first one is [Applause] how do we deliver value to part patients participants in such a way that say such that they will want to do this um the way the reason I think about this is you know confession I play Pokemon go I still play Pokemon go I know we did in 2016 it's kind of thing they passed they have a hundred million people engaged playing this game and you don't you run around a city with your face buried in front have you ever played in this um and you you look kind of ridiculous but there are adults saying this I say I play with my kids but you know there are adults playing this and there is a value that is exchanged right um and so we do have lots of different apps and other things that in that engage users or give value back to users such that they will want to do certain things and so I think I don't know we don't know we have the answer but there are other things other industries that we can learn from about how to give users value uh in such a way that they will want to engage I think that's first thing um and also recognizing that people aren't coin operated it's not just about giving people money to do the thing right like I don't get money to play Pokemon in fact I play I pay money to do this thing right so it's not just about money it's about other things and so Val we have to think about value broadly um so that's one one piece the other piece is um uh interoperability right so so we've got a few hundred folks who are excited to do stuff here we got another few hundred folks you know here and and if you aggregate it over you know appear aggregate over multiple academic centers multiple manufacturers you actually have lots you may have lots of data they just are lots of um people that are that are interested in right interested in helping but they just have all these different kinds of data and we can't we can't make them work together right um we have people like Army and women we have women who are willing hundreds of thousands of women who are willing to normal women that are literally willing to get biopsies right to help with something like this so I can't imagine not being I think we can activate the people but when we do activate folks we have to make good on the promise that Their donation is going to multiply Beyond one single study so I think those are the two those are the two ways that I would try to address the problem but I acknowledge this is a big problem and we have to figure it out okay I reduced that to uh gamification and altruism okay um next question Dr egg is to your point yes sir I represented an institution that trains a lot of nurses wrote memorization and board exams the national board on um National Council on state Boards of Nursing is revising its assessment next year for the national boards and testing on the high levels of cognitive testing and clinical judgment and essentially just changing the way they test it's going to be a milestone change but you treated Steve Jobs first question how was it to treat him and number two you have some thoughts about supplements and the impact on cancer who would you comment David over to you hold on uh to date there has yet to be a study showing a benefit to a vitamin or supplement in a normal individual in this world and so certainly I'm not a believer in taking things without data we are a complex emergent system so the notion in a reductionist way take this this will happen doesn't make a lot of sense um you know Steve was a remarkable man I think you know I'll end here because I think it's a very important note is that you know he said to me once why can't you uh look at my cancer that I like her to code and where there's an error in the code I can correct it and then everything is okay and I think it's a very prescient thing is to try to you know get reductionist in cancer we tried to do with genomics and it got us a little bit ways there we have some certainly molecular targeted therapies that have had benefits but it has not solved the problem of cancer we have a long way to go and it is a complex immersion system and so the way to get to cope Plex emergence systems is to have large data sets and you don't need an understanding necessary of all the biology in order to make an intervention that has a benefit and I think that's the way we're going to go I think we have time for one more question Anna you got the last question well I may this may not go over well but I'll ask it anyway so first of all right yes of course we do um so with all due respect I want to ask Bill a question about this essay that is so Infamous now it's on everybody's mind and I I will say this before I ask about a question you know I in my mind we have invested an enormous amounts of our resources in creating molecular data sets and and wildly popular cellular assays Etc having said that most of that work has gone toward identifying new targets for therapy and so I think we should be thinking about how does that apply to prevent cancer and how is that going to apply to detect disease very early so that's all for saying that I'm I think this is a good idea and I think it will play out as a good idea but the question I have for you is why are you doing this as a laboratory developed test and selling it before you had the data to actually know and I'm asking the question based on the fact that the laboratory develops laboratory developed tests will be regulated very soon I think by the FDA the ballot Act is being actually talked about today in Congress as a matter of fact and I just wonder why Grail didn't go to the the trouble of actually pursuing this test as a PN PMA from day one why did you choose to sell it under CLIA versus going after the approval for FDA so I told you you wouldn't like the questions no I and it's a good question I don't have all the answers answers for you in in the few months I've been at Grail but what I can tell you is that that this test is picking up cancers that are making a difference now my Eureka moment was a two centimeter body of pancreas cancer as a pancreatic cancer surgeon I've never seen that so we are making a difference in local control if we're not making any difference in survival a two centimeter hypopharyngeal cancer Mayo Clinic called about they go we've never seen it what do we do do we need to radiate what do we do so I think there is there's efficacy that that we've been seeing the actual the the decision between ldt going straight for PMA uh you know was I don't know all the details why that decision was was made but seeing the efficacy and seeing it in so many thousands of patients hundreds of thousands of patients or or implementing it in hundreds of thousands of patients was our logic respect something sure and and you know the question was for those who weren't on microphones is this like uh uh the shades of Elizabeth Holmes Etc and and we get get asked that that a lot this is not a drop of blood without a lot of data this is very very deep science that I believe and I believe that that the technology is going to spawn a lot more than just early detection because we haven't looked at regulation we've focused on DNA and DNA mutations and that's a fraction of the problem it's regulation and I believe that those methylation profiles are going to identify subsets of high-risk people down the road probably predict who responds to therapy for immunotherapy so I think that's the broad spectrum of this so our broad deep approach to you know over four hundred thousand tests so far in 330 000 clinical trials I think is is a very deep approach that does not that that is far different from the other approaches you described I want to uh just acknowledge the richness of the discussion and thank our panel it's just been a terrific panel we could have gone on for two more hours and you can see by the depth of the issues and the things that we were just scratching the surface of uh this is a super talented panel I want to thank David Lilly and Bill for their talent their time their thoughts thank you all so much thank you [Applause] ladies and Gentlemen let's thank all of our program participants again over the last two days thank you what a great way to conclude I I could have listened for another two hours uh I think just concluding with with the emphasis on the future it kind of ties back to what Dr vanishenbach was saying yesterday using the past to influence the future and that's the point of this conference and really what what this is all about so I hope that you all found this beneficial uh and now I want to invite everyone to join Dr will Lee in the gift shop where he will be signing copies of his book how to eat to beat disease I also invite you all to follow the Nixon Foundation across social media our handle at Nixon Foundation across all social media thank you all for attending and we'll see you back here next year uh in 2023 thank you foreign

2019 Dr Moyer served as director of The Office of Civilian military cooperation at usaid and previously served as director of the project on Military and diplomatic history at the center for strategic and international studies in Washington D.C the Ulta B.A summa laude from Harvard a PhD from Cambridge Dr Moyer is the William P Harris chair in military history at Hillsdale College and it's my pleasure to introduce Dr moyer for remarks on the Vietnam War and the Paris Peace Accords Dr Moyer thanks Jim for that great introduction I appreciate the opportunity to speak here I'm going to talk today about broader issues of Vietnam historiography and talk a bit about Nixon himself and his role in what I'm covering the new book out Triumph regained goes from 65 to 68. it's the sequel to the earlier book I wrote trying forsaken which goes from 54 to 65 and now the last version we'll look at 69 to 75 and I spent about seven years on the first volume and then off and on worked on this uh the new one for about 13 years and so uh just digging into the research on the Nixon period I won't uh attempt to get into debates with with the great group that this book came before and is speaking afterwards uh because I the thing I've learned in this is until you really dig in to the document's primary sources most of what you heard is probably inaccurate so premise of both of these books of mine is that um the early versions of History were in many cases distorted either just because there was a lack of information or people had partisan agendas now you know 50 years is often seen at kind of the time when we look back and say well we can take up a more just passionate approach I think there's still a lot of passion in the subject but I think hopefully we can be a bit more objective in how we look at it now in the books I address what has been the the controversy between Orthodox and revisionist views of the Vietnam War uh there are some who would say well I think we can we got to move Beyond these labels and uh those are a thing of the past but I do think they're useful in staking out some of the ground I don't agree entirely with the revisionist perspective but I think it's correct in many respects and it hasn't been fully covered by the academy and for those who aren't familiar you know revisionists during the Cold War initially was the group that was critical of the U.S government for its conduct of the Cold War but when we get to Vietnam and the much of the establishment shifts against the war then then the anti-war anti-administration faction becomes Orthodox and it's those later who come to defend to a large degree the administration are the the revisionists the let me will talk very briefly through sort of the origins of the war which I cover and some of you may know Nixon president Nixon was very involved in some of the early discussions about Vietnam in 1954 with the Battle of Jim bienfu he supports sending American troops to take the place of the French troops as the French are in trouble the President Eisenhower says no uh in the first of my books which I'm going to just talk about very briefly I do the title Triumph forsaken refers first and foremost to the coup of November 1963. when uh South Vietnamese generals overthrew an assassinated President Newton's yeah with uh support from the United States and at the time I think actually Richard Nixon understood better than most what was going on and he said in October of 63 that uh and I would quote that I would say the day then Vietnam the choice today is not between presidents Yemen somebody better it is between ZM and and someone infinitely worse which as I argue that going to argue that that that is spot on and in fact is this coup that leads to a rapid decline in the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese government and will encourage North Vietnam to go from Guerrilla War to Conventional War we also know that um Nixon told Eisenhower on November 4th just two days after the assassination that uh said our complicity in ziam's Murder was a National Disgrace which I also agree with but at the time a lot of people didn't really understand this but he clearly did see that so after Zim you have this revolving door of South Vietnamese governments changes in power and each of them purges people who they saw as being too loyal to the preceding regime and this has a highly debilitating impact on the South Vietnamese government in 1964 in August you have the Tonkin golf incidents where there's a North Vietnamese uh Naval attacks Naval attack the second one it seems doubtful it actually happened but there's a perception of attack on the Americans and Lyndon Johnson decides to take a a limited response based on the academic theories that that Robert McNamara had been giving him and that is hoping to convince North Freedom means that this is showing result but in fact the opposite happens and the North Phoenix taking a sign of weakness and then Johnson reinforces that in 1964 during the election when he says we're not going to send American boys 9 or 10 000 miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves and when Nixon or see me when Johnson gets to the middle of 65 the North Vietnamese Invasion uh is now in full bloom and General Westmoreland saying country's about to fall Johnson takes a sober look at what's going on in Southeast Asia and he subscribes to the Domino Theory as did Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower and most other serious Statesmen of the time now the Domino Theory will get maligned later on after 1975 when the dominoes over fall most of them the Cambodia Falls and Khmer Rouge kills a couple many people but most of the other dominoes in the region don't fall it's argued that you know the Domino's Theory really wasn't valid and hence it was just foolish to be in Vietnam but I I argue that the world changes fundamentally from 65 to 75 and this is particularly germane to the Nixon period and the and the anniversary we're selling suddenly uh celebrating today because the Strategic Stakes are going to change uh very dramatically the now in the new book I pick up with the American intervention in August of 65 and it's not long after that that we get to what is one of the most important events in the entire Cold War one that gets ignored in many cases and that is the Indonesian coup encounter coup of October 1965. in that episode president sicarno who is in now in League with the Indonesian Communist Party is decides he needs to destroy the leadership of the Indonesian military because they are seen as too hostile to the Communists so he orders that the leaders be rounded up and they are some of them are killed some are arrested one escapes but he neglects to arrest one critical General that's General saharto and he thinks saharcho is an opportunist and will go whichever way uh he sees things going and to some extent that's a proper analysis because saharto doesn't do anything at the beginning when he learns of this coup he's near the uh location where the where the coup is taking place so what he does is he goes and surveys other Generals in near the capitol to see which way they are going to go and enough of them say that they want to resist the Communists that that is ultimately the course he chooses to take and in the book I set a lot of evidence indicating that in fact the American Standard Vietnam is critical to this decision of the Indonesian military I think had the United States bailed out in South Vietnam the Indonesians would have seen that basically there's no hope that the Americans are going to help them resist communism and they would have gone along with sicarno and president future President Nixon's actually one of the first people to recognize this truth and in his uh famous foreign affairs article of October of 1967 he actually writes that um the U.S presence has provided tangible and highly visible proof that communism is not necessarily the wave of Asia's future this was a vital factor in the turnaround in Indonesia so then from there I argue that uh you know China's Specialists looking at what happens next highlights the impact of two critical setbacks for China in late 1965 one is the American intervention Vietnam and the other is the failure of sicarno in Indonesia so he had beginning of 65 things were looking great for him all of a sudden these two big victories he's hoping for uh fall out of his reach and this then encourages him to shift away from foreign affairs to Internal Affairs and to look for enemies within and this then provokes the great proletarian cultural revolution which will devastate China's economy and its military several million people probably don't know the exact numbers but a lot of people killed including a lot of the society's Elites and uh it will lead to a decline in support for other countries in the region it will also the cultural revolution and also the Vietnam itself lead to a widening of the sino-soviet split the Soviets are appalled by the cultural revolution and they are competing with China for influence in North Vietnam and as U.S air War builds up over North Vietnam the Vietnamese increasingly looked to the Soviets for help because the Soviets have anti-aircraft Weaponry that China doesn't have and the growing dependence of North Vietnam on the Soviets will cause uh China to become increasingly skeptical and eventually hostile and uh so we see because of these changing Dynamics because of Indonesia and also what we see China losing its appetite for these International Crusades and then the falling out between China and North Vietnam that the Strategic value of South Vietnam is declining from the point of view of the United States it doesn't go to zero at any point I don't think but but this is certainly something that I think is Weighing on the minds of Nixon and Kissinger and others in the United States as events proceed in the early 70s now during the period the the lighter part of the Johnson Administration one of the biggest disputes which I cover in pale is over the question of expanding the war The Joint Chiefs of Staff President Eisenhower and other Hawks including uh Richard Nixon are arguing that under the parameters set by President Johnson there's no way really to achieve a decisive end because you're just fighting in South Vietnam you allow the North Vietnamese to keep sending troops indefinitely into the country so no matter how many of you killed there's going to be more the war could go on and they they want to in particular cut the Ho Chi Min Trail Laos there's a lot of pressure to step up the bombing of the north Operation Rolling Thunder and the belief that the gradual escalation policy of Robert McNamara has not been sufficient but for most of this period Johnson is still under the spell of McNamara and McNamara has a lot of reasons why he opposes these methods of escalation and arguing that they're not going to work that they're going to provoke Chinese Soviet intervention in particular now we have with the wisdom of 50 years and as more information has come out we have a much better idea of how to assess these alternative options and we know from both the Soviets and the Chinese that in fact they were not interested in intervening militarily directly in Vietnam they had their own problems to deal with the Chinese had gotten burned in Korea and they didn't want any part of that so there were a lot of missed opportunities on the U.S part because of uh false fears of the enemy now President Nixon will himself in each of these cases at some point in his presidency take action the uh the incursion of Cambodia 1970 sending the Southeast Ohio since 1971 and um escalating the bombing in 1972. there is one point I found one of the more interesting things that I had no idea about is that in 1967 there is a point where the North Vietnamese appear to be on the brink of submission because Johnson's temporarily authorized new strikes in North Vietnam and North Vietnam the city of Hanoi is on the brink of starvation because of the damage to their infrastructure but Johnson will end up backing off and who doesn't really um understand what's going on the depth of the problems there and so this will be another missed opportunity Lyndon Johnson in March of 1968 goes on the air to announce that he is not going to run against the president and that he's going to stop bombing parts of the north for a while and this is often taken as evidence that basically the United States has begun to check out of the war and this is uh another I think critical misperception which is also important in understanding how the war transitions to the Nixon presidency but uh Johnson does not actually really plan to de-escalate in the north and areas he stops bombing at this point in time are actually areas that where the weather is so bad that you couldn't bomb much anyway and we'll see to the end of his presidency he will not reduce the U.S troop level and he will continue to uh to keep up the military pressure in the south in the second part well starting in May of 1968 there's two more big North Vietnamese offensives they call them the second and third wave first wave being the Ted offensive of 1968 which had gone horribly wrong the second and third wave are not as well known but in the book I have made use of a lot of North Vietnamese sources from Merle priviano who some of the other people on this program have also benefited from but these North Viennese sources indicate clearly that these two second the second and third wave offenses were even more devastating to them than the first because they basically try the same thing which was attacking the cities and this time they didn't even have the element of surprise and so the Americans South Vietnamese are just there waiting to to crush them and so this will at the end of the third wave this will pave the way for an expansion of the pacification program and will leave the incoming President Nixon with a much more favorable environment within the South and I argue that um the it's really this change in the military situation that leads to a fundamental change in the American way to the war I think there's sometimes a uh an argument that's General Abrams when he comes in in 68 changes things just be based on the philosophical differences but he actually keeps things more or less the same until the third wave offensive has been crushed and so in November of 68 we get to the accelerated pacification campaign where South Vietnamese government starts going very rapidly into a number of villages where it had not been for a long time and with considerable success when we get towards the end of 68 I also found sort of startled to find information on public opinion that seem to contradict what we generally had thought people who've read about the war are probably familiar with a chart that shows over time and the answer to the question do you think the U.S made a mistake sending it sending troops to fight in Vietnam and in 1968 for the first time you see more Americans are saying it was a mistake that it was not a mistake and so this has been interpreted as proof that aha see now the American people in 1968 have lost hope in the war they're ready to to give up well that turns out not to be the case it turns out that there are a lot of people who think it was a mistake and we don't know why necessarily why they thought it but I thought it was a mistake but they think we should still keep fighting there and you know a lot of these people are hawks who thought it was a mistake probably because of how the administration handled it they didn't like how it had been handled we have uh there's two polls from late 68 about U.S policy and what people think should be done and one of them says uh uh and this is in October of 68. how many how many Americans want to get out of Vietnam entirely it's only 13 percent and there's the other poll that's taken in this time period is about 19 so less than one out of five Americans are actually at the end of 1968 advocating that the U.S just get out of Vietnam which is very different from how we often perceive this period one of the most interesting aspects of this enduring support too is the fact that you never really have a president who is selling the war to the American people and the way that other presidents have done and Lyndon Johnson will admit to this in some candid conversations and he says at one point if history indicts us for Vietnam it will be for fighting a war without trying to stir up patriotism and so it's especially remarkable that you have this ongoing support for a war and I think it had it's a reflection of American culture that Americans recognize the importance of perseverance they recognize the damage you could incur if you go help a nation and then just bail out on your allies very quickly when things go south and there's also a general recognition that there is a global struggle with Communism that's going on and that the United States needs to Prevail ultimately in this struggle you can also see interesting signs of the public mood from the presidential race the the uh contest between Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey and when you get to the Chicago convention in August 1968 the Democratic Convention Humphrey is being urged by the liberal wing of the democratic party to adopt a dovish plank which involves quickly pulling the United States out of Vietnam forming a coalition government between communist and non-communist elements the same sort of coalition government that had failed miserably in in Czechoslovakia in Poland and elsewhere but Humphrey decides he's not going to go with that liberal plank even that he himself is fairly liberal but the party's moderates and conservatives do not like this liberal plank they are among those who want to stick it out and so it's indication of the support for the ongoing support for the war that Humphrey ends up rejecting the liberal Plank and going with a a more Centrist policy which um involves continuing continued American participation Vietnam and then he gives a famous speech at Salt Lake City in October which is in an attempt to close what's a very large large gap with Richard Nixon and uh so he talks about how being more accommodating in negotiations but he's still at the end it says that we are not going to withdraw from Vietnam he's still concerned about all of these moderate and conservative Democrats and other voters who are not on board with the idea of pulling the plug on Vietnam now Nixon himself during the campaign he is also being very interested in quoting moderate voters and he's in a pretty good position to do this because he's already built up this reputation as a staunch anti-communist and so he can afford to make some more than Humphrey really then to to make some talk of of negotiating a piece without seeming too soft and he does oftentimes try to avoid committing himself too much to anyone initiative uh and he will say on a number of occasions that preserving South Vietnam is essential to our security um he doesn't talk as much as before about harsher and stronger uh measures of escalation and he does you know at one point he's asked by a journalist if he has a secret plan to end the war and turns out he didn't say that but a news reporter somehow just decided he did and so we have this uh myth out there that he promised to have a secret plan and uh and so usually alleged that this was sort of uh falsehood because he didn't actually have a secret plan well he does I think the record shows indicate that he had something elements of a plan it wasn't a highly concrete plan but it included strengthening the South Vietnamese armed forces and increasing American Military pressure while seeking a diplomatic solution and to do that he was going to put pressure on the Soviets and the Chinese to to pressure that North Vietnamese and he also talks about threatening the North Vietnamese with devastation as a means of getting them to go along and that seemed that he was expecting that he could achieve this sort of diplomatic settlement within his first year in office one other thing I want to mention briefly about the 1968 election is covered near the end of the book there is the long-standing uh assessment or allegation that the next administrator Nixon candidacy campaign colluded with Madame chenow to throw the election and that Shino and Nixon convinced president two to avoid getting into peace negotiations simply uh by by through underhanded promises and so forth and um you know after looking at this you know it's it's very clear that um chew did not in fact need any of this pressure cajoling from Chino or Nixon he knew early on that Humphrey was a bit tepid towards his government and the cause and he knew that Nixon would be tougher and more supportive of South Vietnam and so he does face this choice on negotiations that could influence the election into um you know has to make a decision and he does decide to abstain from the negotiations which will help Nixon get elected but there is no uh it's just no reason to believe that either Nixon or Chino had any influence because again two already knew that it would be better for him if Nixon won the uh you know one other piece of evidence just about the prevalence of support for the war is in the final vote Humphrey gets less than 43 percent of the vote uh whereas the rest goes to Nixon and then to Wallace who uh Wallace is even more hawkish on the war than Nixon and we get to the end of 68 you see Jubilation among the South Vietnamese and among many Americans about Nixon's election because they conclude that this is going to lead to a tougher tougher policies in the war and the North Vietnamese by contrast are now very discouraged because they are convinced that Nixon is going to be tougher than uh than than the Johnson had been uh the last point I just leave you with is that um when we think of the long-term perspective that um we did U.S does end up saving most of the dominoes it doesn't save South Vietnam when you look at what happens in the rest of the region the countries that the U.S does end up saving South Korea and Taiwan in these internal struggles they are now today two of the the most uh prosperous nations in the world whereas China and North Korea are two of the the least free and they're in comparison not as prosperous and Vietnam I think the same goes for Vietnam so I think tragic Legacy is that there is not today a South Vietnam and this I think there certainly could have been a South Vietnam that would look a lot like South Korea today thank you very much and enjoyed the opportunity to uh speak with you vote thank you Dr Morton
CgxgatA-q5s,Protecting the environment in times of armed conflict,"The environment is frequently a 'silent victim' of armed conflict. Conflicts can cause long-term damage to the environment, harming people's physical and mental health and livelihoods. Too often, the environment is directly or incidentally damaged by the use of certain tactics of warfare. The environmental consequences are manifold. Attacks can destroy pipelines and power plants, leading to various forms of contamination. Explosive remnants of war can contaminate soil and water sources, and harm wildlife. The Russian invasion in Ukraine demonstrates the damage caused to internationally protected wetlands as well as biosphere and national parks. 

In this webinar three experts who have followed the development of the principles for the protection of the environment in relation to armed conflict will discuss the principles and the current momentum of this agenda. We ask them if UN's member states, militaries, Non-State Armed Groups, and other actors mentioned in the principles are ready to implement them, and what can be done to move the agenda forward.

neboutet I'm a senior researcher here at Danish Institute for international studies and I will be chairing this webinar and I will start by giving the word to Cairo muniver who's an independent researcher who has been organizing this webinar so I'll let him introduce the webinar and the speakers thank you thank you Finn um to all of you it is a pleasure to have you online for this webinar ah it is a pleasure to have you online for this webinar about the protection of the environment in times of army conflict up to the webinar since they put that senior research at these and I wrote a brief pointing out recent policy legal and research initiatives around the protection of the environment and conflict you can follow the link in the chat to read the brief in this brief we identified key stakeholders working on protection of the environment during conflict they are here with us today the conflict and environment Observatory the international Committee of the Red Cross and Geneva Cole let me say a few words about the panelists their institutions and their work first talk weird and Subs a doc is a research and policy director at the conflict that environment Observatory seals Subs has followed for several years the work of the international law Commission ilc on the development of the principles for the protection of the environment in relation to Armed conflicts seops has accumulated throughout the years invaluable knowledge in the field of environment and conflict our second speaker is Vanessa Murphy senior legal advisor at the icrc in Geneva International Committee of the Red Cross her present work focuses among other issues on the protection of the environment in Army conflict and she is the co-author of the icrc's guidelines from 2020 on the protection of the natural environment in armed conflict our third speaker is a regional legal and policy coordinator for the near and Middle East at Geneva call Hiba has extensive experience engaging local and Regional stakeholders including our groups and the faculty authorities in the protection of civilians in armed conflict she will introduce us to the operational challenges when dealing with armed groups and environmental issues until now the environment has not been a key issue when engaging engaging with armed groups and the factual authorities a situation that might change in the near future our first speaker is me is Mr Doug Weir from Seals the floor is yours we will have 10 minutes for each speaker followed by 10 minutes for question and answers from you the audience a and questions for each organization welcome Doc and a pleasure to have you here thank you Hunter thank you fan just let me check excellent okay um yeah good morning good afternoon good evening that's the same seems to go these days a quick thank you to the dentist Institute for international studies for the invitation to contribute today um as with Vanessa last week we were in New York for the um final UN General Assembly sixth committee debate on the international law commission's decade long study into how the framework protects the environment in relation to Armed conflicts could be strengthened I think more than 50 states engaged with the debate and the general tone was positively constructive although it's obviously it wasn't Universal and some states still have lingering objections to particular components of the principles or their commentaries and today I'll provide a quick overview of the principles themselves and the question of what happens next so just by way of introduction um see OBS and its predecessor organization have been contributing to the perak process for most of its duration that's from reporting on Sixth committee debates to examining how the principles might work in practice based on our conflict monitoring work and to undertaking the first ever stock takes of national practice we've also worked to communicate the aim of the power process to legal and non-legal audiences so the international law commission advises for UN General Assembly on the Progressive development and codification of international law it's peric study which began in 2013 in response to a request from the U.N environment program represents the most significant advance in the legal framework protecting the environment before during and after arm conflicts and in situations of occupation since the 1970s its output will be 27 principles that have been informed by International humanitarian law international environmental law human rights law international security law and the practice of states and international organizations the principles are a mixture of binding and non-binding obligations and a civil society we view the principles as a vital normative framework that establishes a minimum standard of environmental conduct across the cycles of armed conflict naturally this is a standard that can and should be built on further however the principles will only achieve the goal this goal if they're endorsed promoted and implemented by States and arranges non-state stakeholders so we also need to look ahead at what we can collectively do to bring the principles to life so the principles are part of a wider peric landscape which includes the icrc's work to update its guidelines for militaries principles on the protection of water infrastructure and principles for Victim Assistance from the toxic remnants of War in the next few slides I'll draw out a few key themes that are important considerations for Park implementation so I think the first thing to think about is that environmental harm in relation to Armed conflicts is better documented than ever before and the importance that we place on Environmental Protection has grown and critically will continue to grow well external factors like the environmental consequences the invasion of Ukraine or three decades decades ago the burning oil fields of Kuwait can shift policies and positions there's enormous value in having a forum for ongoing discussion and dialogue our understanding of how the environment is impacted both directly and indirectly continues to develop and the more we understand about these impacts the better place will be to identify policies to prevent or minimize harm the parent process and the sixth committed debates have been invaluable for exploring the environmental dimensions of armed conflicts this has also been true of recent U.N environmental assembly resolutions and other initiatives it's forced states to identify and take positions and in many cases to begin engaging with Civil Society and also with the realities of environmental harm we shouldn't minimize the importance of this for a topic but is often sidelined or only addressed obliquely in both environmental humanitarian and security forum the service begs the question once the principles are adopted how do we keep this dialogue going well it's in the international law commission's power to propose new conventions the process will not conclude of a new treaty on conflicts in the environment instead we have its softest output principles but just to confuse matters the principles are a blend of pre-existing binding obligations and non-binding obligations as well as best practice but it's a temporal and thematic scope that makes them incredibly value normatively valuable normatively speaking the commission suggested that implementation should be left up to States and right now this means that the principles have no clear custodian nobody charged with supporting implementation but in this challenge we also have an opportunity so back in 2020 and with the sport of Finland and Norway we explored what kind of implementation vehicle might be appropriate for the pair of principles we found a number of models and approaches that could be used to promote their universalization and implementation and throughout the need for that something was readily apparent something to breathe life into the principles we should not sit passively any expectation that they will be implemented happily we're already seeing conversations beginning about how individual principles could be developed and implemented there's also the broader question of how the implementation of The Wider landscape could be monitored and promoted naturally there are risks with a solely piecemeal approach there's a long way to run it's obviously just the very start of this process but and there's already a lot of enthusiasm out there from illegal and perak communities so the parent principles are implanted to apply to both International and non-international armed conflicts moreover there are a number of principles that directly address both state and non-state stakeholders these include International organizations business enterprises and Civil Society organizations from a wide range of backgrounds add to their states and their different components be the ministries of defense or environment and non-state armed actors whether private military and security contractors or armed groups these interactions suggest a broad and Rich Foundation of stakeholders whose engagement on Environmental Protection through the principles would be an important component of an ongoing implementation program given the number of non-international armed conflicts where the conduct of non-state armed groups in an important determinant of environmental harm non-state armed groups represent a vitally important yet currently under address constituency for future perk implementation when we reviewed potential implementation models one thing was clear it would need the buy-in of a group of like-minded states states that supported the twin goals of reducing environmental and civilian harm in relation to Armed conflicts it would require leadership from States in this they would be assisted by a growing number of stakeholders including Civil Society organizations and academic experts and one important and straightforward task would be promoting the principles in relevant International processes and Forum whether these are security focused or whether they address the environment other potential areas for consideration by such a group might include the role of a UN General Assembly in promoting the principles as well as implementation at home via domestic military manuals haven't reviewed the national practice of two states we can say that many states are probably more aligned with the principles than they think they are and for those that aren't yet we're sharing a best practice and implementation between states would be another valuable role as with engagement with those non-state stakeholders dressed by the principles I'll defer to more informed members of the panel about the prospects of State engagement with non-state arm groups on peric but as far as the process and National positions are concerned the focus has been primarily on whether a principal could be identified outlining the accountability or responsibility of non-state armed groups for environmental damage and then the Special Report concluded that there was insufficient practice to develop one alongside that we've also noticed an increasing Trend in the politicization of the environment in the context of armed conflicts this is perhaps a reaction to Growing public environmental Awareness on the need for protection but it's something that requires further research and it may well impede the potential for engaging with non-state armed groups in some conflicts to conclude the principles have the potential to be a vital normative framework that establishes a minimum standard of environmental conduct across the cycles of armed conflict there's enormous value in supporting ongoing Dialogue on Environmental Protection in relation to Armed conflicts absent a custodian there's a risk that the parent principles will not reach their potential and it's up to us all of us to breathe life into them work is already beginning on developing specific principles and whatever model or models are chosen to take implementation forward a group of like-minded states will probably be vital because of the scope of the principles and their applicability to International and non-international art conflicts non-state armed groups should be important stakeholders in implementation but the prospects and modalities of that remain to be explored so thank you for listening I shall leave it there thank you very much that was a great introduction um now we have some time for questions for you we have one here actually um so it's about the legal efficiency so the question is how far are the principles and express an expression of customary international law and do we have any examples ah yes it's a good question for a lawyer I think um so the principles are are maybe answer that somewhat of Juicy and so I think the principles are kind of a heady blend across the 27 of them of reflections of existing treaty obligations and customary law with some components of that being pushed and tweaked a little further than previously been the case similarly the principles aren't occupation a really great example of evolutionary interpretation of that's quite it's quite dated now occupation law um I think probably the most interesting and exciting ones at least those which kind of got the most pushback from States Beyond those States who were concerned any attempt to interfere with IHL or medal with it or if it's anyway um where maybe the principles around business enterprises and conduct a business Enterprise in areas affected by conflict which speaks to the debate going on elsewhere around business and human rights and so that was an area of particular interest and Progressive development I think which didn't entirely answer your question but that was a non-lawyer's answer I don't have I don't have any questions right now so maybe you Jairo could chip in yes indeed and thank you DOC for the presentation um my first question is regarding the principles I would like to ask you a what states are more in line with the perak principles and secondly what are the aspects of the principles that had been most most criticized by States thank you yeah I'm so I'll just think of this so there's been a range of Interest so there's been maybe um maybe 35 40 States who've been fairly vocal in the process throughout there are just a handful of States who have had almost no or very few objections so for example the Nordic governments have been very supportive throughout there are some states whose positions have changed because the price has been going on for 10 years so for example Spain at the start of the process they were extremely skeptical about the need for it and issued a number of statements to that effect by the end of the consultation before the second reading Spain were criticizing the principles for not being Progressive enough so there are other countries like Russia who remain opposed say that they are only interested in or primarily interested in protection of civilians rather than the protection of the environment making that what you will um and then countries like the UK well nuclear weapon States essentially who have particular persistent objections around components of IHL relating to the environment which relate to their freedom to use nuclear weapons um there are other countries which have had specific objections to specific principles so for example Vietnam have been very Progressive and supportive of the principles as a whole but had a number of criticisms around the principle on indigenous people in relation to their own National context similarly France also criticized the principle on indigenous people because they don't recognize indigenous peoples everyone is French under the Republic so um it's a really kind of interesting how do you mix and you can maybe get a sense of that there's a report we did earlier in the year which looked at all the written submissions which states had put in which were like 20 or so submissions and reading through those will give you kind of an idea of how states have been engaging with these principles but yeah there are very few who um universally accept their full content and then there are obviously for example discussion today who are called out just a few days ago why business enterprises had been singled out in the principles and not other non-state actors like armed groups for example and Bad actors as they call them so um yeah it's quite interesting and they reflect very much sort of State interests okay thank you um there is another question here um it says have you seen more examples of the principle of Distinction not being observed in recent disputes for example water pumping stations targeted intentionally so maybe you could also just briefly tell what the principle of Distinction means in this connection Ah that's a great question for Vanessa um so this is the need to distinguish between military and civilian objects um so I think as Vanessa will discuss there is how the environment is viewed as a spinning object Vanessa would you like to take this one it seems relevant to your interests sure yes yes so the principle of Distinction is an IHL rule it's kind of one of the core principles of the conduct of hostilities of IHL and the icrc considers it to be a customary IHL rule so it applies to International arms conflicts between states and non-international armed conflicts meaning it also binds non-state armed groups and it requires that at all times there's distinction between lawful military objectives and civilian objects and the environment in general is civilian in character and what that means is unless a specific part of the environment has been turned into a military objective so an example of that might be a tree that is hiding a fighter right hiding behind a tree maybe in that specific instance a part of the natural environment has become a military objective and in that case it would be lawful to Target it subject to the other rules of IHL placing limits on how it can be targeted but in general the environment is civilian in character meaning it cannot be directly attacked meaning that in some circumstances it might be a war crime to directly attack the environment in the same way that it to war climb to attack civilian objects such as schools or hospitals in situations of conflict so that's the the meaning of the rule of Distinction and it's set out in um principle 13 and principle 14 of of the ilc principles um and maybe maybe back to you Doug on on examples related to the question thanks Vanessa that was indeed far better announcer than I could ever have given um yeah I think we've maybe seen yeah I think the question I'm just thinking about the recent events in Ukraine I'm a deliberate targeting of infrastructure which is uh the civilian population depends on energy infrastructure or hydroelectric infrastructure um and that's a clear case where there is no distinction being made between what our civilian objects and what are military objectives in the context of the conflict so I think it's a common issue across many conflicts that we look at okay thank you um we have time for one more question so maybe Jairo you have one yes I wanted to ask you about the implementation levels of the Prague principles and there's a lot of talk about localizing humanitarian Aid and I was wondering if the solutions needed here to implement the principles are not quite localized the question is then are we talking on on the right label you know for implementing the product principles and that's a really interesting point um yeah I think we definitely need the top level side we need people to be aware of them you know at the moment although this process has been going on for 10 years it's it's fairly Niche right even within the legal and international law Community um and we need that to change so that needs these principles to be raised in the context of different processes and different for it and for them to be almost a reference point that people come back to when discussing Environmental Protection and conflicts but then beyond that and obviously beyond the text of the principles themselves the commentaries which obviously been developed over the last 10 years but knowledge develops and knowledge grows and while a lot of people were consulted a lot of states and others engaged with the process to develop the commentaries and there are still a lot more voices and a lot more perceptions out there who can contribute to this question of how we Implement them and what implementation actually looks like on the ground and in a lot of these cases actually it's the people who are underground who are the best understanding of how the environment is damaged and what specific policies could be put in place to prevent them in order to ensure that the purpose of the principles are implemented okay thank you very much um I think maybe we should save the further questions for the for the General Session at the end so I would like to give the word to Vanessa please take the floor great thank you and I'm just gonna share my slides so let me know if you can just nod if you can see them okay yes great wonderful okay so um thank you very much to Doug for for giving such a good overview of the ilc principles and so the focus of my remarks um today are how the ilc principles are complementary to the I the icrcs work on the same topics on the protection of the environment in armed conflict and also how we might be able to move implementation forward quite specifically on some of the principles that apply during arm conflict so what I'd like to do in order to get into that is speak about these five things so first of all zoom in on the principles that apply specifically during arm conflict then explain from from our perspective really why these matter why it's important to be speaking about this in 2022 number three introduce um the icic's work that complements the principles applying during arm conflict and specifically our guidelines on the protection of the environment in armed conflict which go into some further detail on some of the rules spelldown in the ilc principles and then number four Zoom in quite specifically on principle 14 so on the conduct hostilities rules and the legal limits of how parties can apply the conduct of hostility rules to the environment as they fight and then finish number five with a few Reflections on how to move forward and implementation so to begin as Doug said I'd like to emphasize that you know these principles are of a historic contribution to both the clarification and the strengthening of international law on the environment in armed conflict and as Doug said and I agree really this is the most significant Milestone the international legal Community has had in this area probably since the 1970s and that is first of all an exciting thing for the legal community and second of all additional motivation for The Wider legal community and not just International lawyers but also those working on this issue at domestic level Civil Society armed actors to start paying more attention to this issue as it will become more more important in years to come so a very significant achievement by the international law Commission so of the principles there are um I forget now is it I keep thinking it's 27 or 28 it's either 27 or 28 principles and of these they apply before during and after arm conflict and the ones that apply during arm conflict are principles 12 to 21 so essentially the principles that apply during drawing quite specifically from IHL 12 to 18 and then the principles applying in situations of occupation which is also a form of international arm conflict so really the principles 12 to 21. and to give an example give go through um a recap of what these these address so this includes rules on uh the widespread long-term and severe environmental damage that can be covered during armed conflict in the view of the icrc this is a customer law Prohibition in international armed conflicts it's also the application of the principles of Distinction of precautions of proportionality to the environment it's the prohibition of reprisals against the natural environment prohibition of pillage and rules on how an occupying power must govern uh the environment in occupied territory so these principles so principles 12 to 21 are of primary relevance to States and non-state armed groups they also many of them apply to non-state Armed groups who are fighting armed conflicts so who are parties to arm conflicts right now so in a nutshell they set legal limits on how parties can conduct hostilities and occupy territory including in contemporary armed conflicts and why these matter I would say there's kind of three buckets of why these matter or the way that we think about it at the icrc first of all because of the damage that is caused to the environment in arm conflict that we have seen as Doug said really since Vietnam but quite consistently since then so attacks damage the environment directly if the environment is specifically targeted but also incidental damage that occurs for example when chemical facilities or industrial facilities are targeted then various types of land can or contamination whether it's water soil or other land contamination take place another aspect of this is is biodiversity so the iucn released a report uh last year or not that long ago and they um found that over the last 70 years humans have waged war in many of the world's most important places for biodiversity including regions that hold many imperiled species and when you set this Against The Wider work that it is that is being done at International level to document how biodiversity is crashing in an unprecedented excuse me in an unprecedented way then we understand that the issue of armed conflicts fought in biodiversity hotspots is becoming more pressing than ever because the damage that is done in many cases will be irreversible explosive weapons also leave behind toxic remnants of war that take years if not decades to remedy and damaged facilities containing a range of other pollutants which again create further pollution so long story short the way that Wars are fought today create a huge amount of direct and indirect damage to the environment second point on this is for the icrc this is a protection of Civilian issue it is not a separate issue from the protection of civilians when the environment is damaged conflict affected populations bear the cost and that's very intuitive right because we rely on the environment for food we rely on it for water we rely on it to keep in good health and generally we rely on it for for livelihood so that could be fishing it could be agriculture farming communities essentially if the environment is damaged civilians will also bear the Brunt so really the the it's important to think of the environment as a protection of Civilian issue and the third and final point on why this matters more than ever in 2022 and why the ilc's work is so Timely is that the climate crisis is rendering the environment all the more vulnerable and creating additional risks on populations in Conflict so um the icrc has has looked at the ND gain indexed and we've concluded that 15 of the 25 States that are most vulnerable and least ready to adapt to climate change are also experiencing armed conflicts so it's this um Confluence of conflict environmental degradation and climate change that are exacerbating each other and means that the environment is all the more fragile and at the same time all the more precious so those are those who are in a nutshell why we think that this issue is particularly important to speak about in 2022 next point is how these principles that apply during arm conflict can be complemented or we we feel have very much complemented the work the IELTS the icrc is doing in this area in 2022 we released our guidelines on the protection of the natural environment in armed conflict they set out 32 legal obligations and policy recommendations specifically under International humanitarian law so as Doug said the ilc's principles are much broader in that they look at um international law that applies prior to during an afterarm conflict and they draw on a wider body of law so environmental law human rights law they look at how these bodies of law work together whereas these guidelines Focus very specifically on International humanitarian law they contain many of the rules that the ilc principles do as well so principles 13 14 15 16 are also elaborated on in this document and what they do is they explain in Greater detail how those rules can be applied by parties to Armed conflicts so what does it really mean to that disproportionate damage against the environment is prohibited what does that look like in practice are there examples so this document is complementary to the ilc's principles and is intended to be a resource for States party Storm Conflict and other actors who engage with Implement and apply IHL its purpose is really to facilitate the adoption of concrete measures to enhance the respect for ihl's protections of the environment the and those speak to the ilc principles 12 12 to 18. I'd like to just uh before before moving on to um Reflections on implementation I wanted to zoom in and spend a moment talking about ilc principle 14. so this is built on the civilian character of the natural environment and the application of the conduct of hostility rules to the natural environment and the principle says the law of armed conflict so also known as International humanitarian law including the principles and rules on distinction proportionality and precautions shall be applied to the environment with with a view to its protection and this is a extremely powerful rule because these rules of IHL distinction proportionality and precautions are the ones that are applied probably the most commonly in contemporary armed conflicts almost on a daily basis so if we can really ensure that that rule is applied to take account of environmental damage in a greater degree than it is currently that has the potential to change behavior and to reduce the scale of damage that we see in contemporary contemporary armed conflicts so uh the icrc guidelines provide additional detail on how that rule can be applied um to give an example uh the guidelines commentary paragraphs 14 to or 114 to 122 speak about the different factors that should be taken into account when applying that rule so for example the obligation includes um or rather sorry one moment I'm just going to um as I'm so sorry my screen has froze and there we go the obligation includes um taking into account an attack's indirect effects on the natural environment and what that means is that indirect effects that are reasonably foreseeable to A party's term conflict must be taken into account in conducting a proportionality assessment meaning a proportionality the proportionality of the damage that is going to be caused against the military gain that will be achieved by a particular attack and in that respect what should be taken into account is information from all sources available at the relevant time so that can include information that is provided by Civil Society or environmental experts who are available on the ground who are making that information available to Commanders and also informed by past practice and empirical data so what that means is that fighting forces should be learning if they have consistently attacked a particular type of objective and they know that the damage that will be caused is long lasting they have done so in the past then that is the kind of information that should be taken into account um with respect to the indirect effects of an attack information regarding the long-term risks attended to the disruption of ecosystems um is going to also increase as um the the global Community gets better at documenting this kind of damage so when we think about the Vietnam conflict in the 70s little a lot less was known about how long the damage would last how how um widespread the effects would be whether it would have long lasting Health impacts also on the civilian population so we knew a lot less in the 70s now we know a lot more and what that means is that we should be able to draw conclusions about whether something is severe whether something is going to have a long effect and that kind of empirical data should be informing the decision the conduct of hostility decisions made by warring forces there will of course be different weights to different types of damage in proportionality assessments so for example a damage to uh um sand in the middle of a desert is going to probably weigh a lot less in a proportionality assessment compared to an important water source or a particularly biodiverse area and an example of disproportionate incidental damage might be for example burning down an entire Forest to eliminate a small enemy camp and an example from history was that generally it was felt that the deliberate spilling of millions of gallons of oil into the sea during the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War was excessive so it was disproportionate so that's kind of an example of History where we've generally the International Community considered that that kind of damage was disproportionate and therefore unlawful specifically with respect to the environmental damage that was caused so uh final Reflections um final reflections with regard to how we can Implement these rules and to on this I will say that you know we know that the law is violated very frequently but I the example that I use when people sort of shrug their shoulders and say is it really worth it what's the value of having these principles if they are not respected is the example of a speed limit so speed limits are often violated we probably all violate them on a daily basis nevertheless even though they are often violated we still feel that they change behavior and they have the capacity to save lives when they are respected so in the same way these rules if they are better known if they are better implemented by States and party's time conflict have the capacity to change Behavior so our asks at the icrc is that number one States and other actors have more work to do to integrate these obligations so the icrc guidelines and also now the ilc principles into military Doctrine military manuals into their training and National Frameworks so that they have the capacity to take environmental damage into account as they fight second we recommend that they should also adopt and Implement measures to increase their own understanding of the effect of military operations on the environment it is sometimes understood to be a relatively new area of law we know how injuries to civilians happen we know a lot less how damage to the environment can last so have militaries improve their understanding of how the environment can be damaged and that can be done in a few different ways so for example to give some examples of this military personnel involved in planning operations could seek advice from environmental experts including civilian agencies on the ground um post-strike battle damage assessments are a good practice that many militaries conduct after a specific military operation they generally do not look at environmental damage so they will assess civilian um damage to civilians damage to specific types of Civilian objects they often don't Encompass environmental damage so that could be a new practice that is adopted and third for example um when weapons are reviewed for their legality consideration could be given to their effects on the environment uh number three we also um recommend and this is in principle four and eighteen of the ilc um principles that party Storm Conflict consider identifying and designating areas of particular environmental importance as demilitarized zones so where the environment is particularly important particularly fragile consider taking um combatants taking military objects taking military operations out of those zones to reduce damage from the outset and fourth exchange good practices and in this respect and I'll end here um we know that this is a growing area that some states have extremely good practice as as Doug mentioned many states actually have quite a lot of environmental aspects integrated into their planning integrated into their military manuals so there are states with plenty of good practice and there are some states who really don't consider it very much at all so there are opportunities to to exchange to improve it's pretty nitty-gritty and boring but I think that that's where a lot of attention is needed and in this respect uh next year in in February and March the icrc in Switzerland are co-convening an expert meeting amongst States precisely for this purpose so to exchange good practice on how the environment can be integrated into military operations so I will leave it there and thank you very much thank you Vanessa um we have a couple of uh questions coming in so the first is isn't there a risk of over stressing the civilian character of the environment within the guideline perak guidelines making the whole exercise to be superfluous I guess it it applies to the um to the icrc guidelines as well I I guess I will answer the question in two ways so the first is that from a purely IHL legal angle the logic of IHL is that something is either a lawful Target a military objective or everything else is civilian so there's no gray area in between you cannot be sort of not a civilian object and not a military objective so by the pure logic of IHL if the environment is not a Civ is not civilian in character that means it could be lawfully attacked but there's very specific criteria around what is a lawful military objective it must be providing direct and concrete contribution to military action so in terms of the pure on HR logic it doesn't really make sense for the environment to be sort of a gray area in between there are plenty of um arguments that have been made um that go in that direction also towards combatants that they're neither a fighter nor a civilian there's something in between and therefore no law applies to them so for the icic it's pretty clear from an IHL perspective it's just logic something either is a military objective or not I think what your question gets at though is is it um is it realistic is it pragmatic will parties time conflict listen if we speak about the environment as on par with civilians so are you really telling us that we can't attack a field and instead we need to think about attacking a hospital or a school or so on and so forth so are you putting it on par with these really important life-saving emergency civilian um civilian objects and to that what we feel is that first of all of course you can make differentiation so that's what the proportionality assessment is for as I said different types of environmental harm will matter differently in the calculation and planning of how military operations take place so the environmental damage that is caused in a desert really is not going to weigh the same to civilian damage that is caused to a hospital certainly not so we're not saying that it's equivalent we're saying that an assessment needs to be made and second of all what we have seen over the last you know 30 or 40 years is that the environment if it is constantly just disregarded completely from military um considerations what that means is that we end up in a situation where 20 years down the line civilians do not have food to eat they must move so human Mobility increases because there has been considerable damage to their livelihoods to Agriculture and the climate crisis is really driving this home so conflict-linked environmental damage in places such as Iraq in places such as there has become really exacerbated and has now made um just subsistence for civilians much more difficult so I would say that not including the environment in an incon in military consideration now is essentially kicking the can down the road and will make any kind of risk reconciliation any kind of development extremely difficult in the next 10 to 20 years okay thank you so that that was very extensive answer we have uh we have two more actually let's take one now um it's uh from Colombia and it says the Amazon basing is facing High rates of logging some countries such as Colombia has declared a warranty for deforestation which is part of The Greening of the military approaches seeking to protect the environment do you have any thoughts of this type of approaches through the lens of the international human insurance law Vanessa that's a very interesting example thank you for sharing it um I would say that and I wonder if Doug has anything to maybe add to this my Reflections the logging and the fact that logging can sometimes increase in situations of conflict from the IHL perspective tends to be an indirect indirect effective conflict right so it's not damage created by hostilities and so for IHL it's not necessarily directly relevant depending on the circumstances um so I'm I feel like from an IHL perspective I'm not sure I have a massive amount to add very helpfully I would maybe just add that the in terms of the environment being a cause for increased military action or the environment being a cause for new ways of the military um planning Maybe engagements that are below an armed conflict threshold and what the icrc sees there is that sometimes there's an overly simplistic link between the environment and climate causing conflict and that is a simplistic link that actually requires a lot more nuance and often when the military gets involved it might be because or rather we should also be looking at different factors such as what are the economic factors that are surrounding that what are the corporations that are involved there what are maybe the social indigenous communities involvement so in a long story short just to say that it's sometimes a simplistic link that is made okay the environment is being damaged and that might cause more conflict or climate change is increasing that might cause more conflict and actually there's a lot more going on there and there are many more factors to consider if we're thinking about how to how to prevent increased or prevent prevent more harm doctor do you have any comments yeah I'd be happy to just jump in briefly because I think it's a really good example of why we really need to have a much better understanding of how non-state armed groups non-state actors interact with the environment so in Colombia during the conflict the presence of the farc and to an extent the aln was provided some protection to rainforests in Colombia and following the peace agreement and the removal that wasn't a dissolution of the to some extent this then allowed a huge increase in rates of deforestation not only in unprotected areas but also in protected areas in Colombia and actually it's a very good example of why um we need protection during conflict but actually the approach the ilc which is accepted that the environment can be affected across all the cycles of conflict is really important because what we see in Colombia is actually very common in most other countries with high rates of tropical forests you see very high rates of deforestation post conflict Sri Lanka is another good example of that um on The Wider question around military Greening and green militarization um yeah I think it's incredibly important that it's not seen as a first solution to these problems and that the underlying issues which may be driving which may be subsistence farming and subsistence economies of communities and why people are poor why people are left out of economic models why people are left out their peace agreements this needs to be addressed first rather than immediately standing in the military and also in some cases we see for example anti-poaching Patrols in other countries you see this question of it blurring the line and leading to escalations between poaching groups and militaries or miniaturized conservationists who go in to protect these areas so these things there's a huge amount of oversight public oversight and transparency and there has to be accountability if you are going to use these approaches in this contexts to protect the environment okay thank you doc um there is one more question but I think we'll save it for the general um discussion General q a and then pass on the word to EBA who now we go from the kind of the policy level and legal discussions to a much more practical intervention so we're looking forward to that Eva thank you thank you very much Finn um so it's my pleasure to speak on this panel today and bring in some of the operational aspects related to Geneva code's work on the protection of the environment so as some of you may know Geneva cool is a field-based a neutral impartial and independent humanitarian organization with a unique mandate and Mission to protect civilians by strengthening the respect of humanitarian Norms so we're speaking about human rights law as well as International humanitarian law by armed groups and de facto authorities so I've as we've just heard um from from the fellow panelists armed conflict contributes to environmental degradation in multiple ways and with long-term consequences including displacement and food insecurity therefore it's very welcome that these are there are indeed a series of ongoing efforts to strengthen and clarify the protection of the environment in armed conflict and it is important to consider and involved armed groups um in these ongoing debates and discussions in order to effectively protect their environment and art conflict and and that's important for several reasons first of all the nature of contemporary armed conflicts which are mostly uh niacs so non-international conflicts and involve or um include armed groups by that definition um moreover also the the number of active armed groups in conflict setting around the world we've seen a massive increase over the last decade um of armed groups active in these conflicts with more than 600 currently active or worldwide and the third reason is also because the international legal architecture is tailored to State actors mostly and makes it very difficult for armed groups to be part of law making or policy making processes but rather than talking about this legal and policy aspects which were very well outlined by um the fellow panelists I would like to delve into practical aspects of relevance to this discussion so undoubtedly as it is the case for other parties to conflict armed groups may also resort to practices that negatively affect the environment for example through unsustainable exploitation of Natural Resources poaching and hunting which was just referred to by by though as well the use of certain weapons in the conduct of hostility namely explosive weapons or landmines they said our groups can also be part of the solution so by adopting protective measures and policies and putting them into practice worse in terms of conduct of hostilities as mentioned by Vanessa so looking at the principles of Distinction proportionality and precautions but also in their governance of the territories or resources under their influence so the question is really how can we meaningfully engage armed groups and de facto authorities to improve the protection of the environment and armed conflict so as it is the case for States we can use IHL as an entry point to engage our booths on the schematic with some additional legal and policy considerations that may be relevant for them for example the question of the capacity of armed groups to make an informed assessment of the potential environmental impact of their activities so during the conduct of hostilities how are they really able to assess while the conflict is ongoing what the impact of their activities will be on the environment including on the short term or also on the long term so there there are many arguing that we should also use the concept of a sliding scale of obligations um to to the issue of the protection of the environment as it is done in other areas such as human rights so similarly there's also another question which is whether and to what extent is it useful to rely on state-centric legal Frameworks to engage armed groups and if we don't really need to have a bit of a shift in the way we address and engage our groups in that matter whatever the case we we can agree that it is very important to involve on groups in the discussion around contemporary challenges and the protection of their environment and the ways to address these challenges so maybe quickly how how does Geneva cool do that so first I would like to highlight up front and this may be a bit disappointing for some um Geneva code does not currently have a standalone um thematic engagement on on the environment so as you may know Geneva call follows a thematic approach which means that rather than engaging armed groups on the panoply of of IHL rules and humanitarian Norms we try to focus on very specific thematic areas starting from the issue of of the ban of anti-personnel Mines but also talking about other issues such as the protection of children from the effects of armed conflict Etc and our work is really expanding to um tailor to all of the newly arising thematic issues and challenges that we face on the ground So currently as I mentioned we do not have an environment as a standalone thematic but we have integrated it in our humanitarian humanitarian engagement emotional to be looking at our work on the prevention of starvation and conflict related food insecurity so we are currently still looking at ways to strengthen and this is why we also welcome this discussion today ways to strengthen our tools that we use for engagement on the specific thematic so going back to the way Geneva Cole operates and in order to improve the conduct of armed groups and armed conflict we work on various levels really to build the knowledge and understanding of armed groups of key humanitarian issues and adopt and support them in the adoption of relevant policies and work on their implementation of these policies and practice and we do that through a wide range of tools and the most prominent one being our deed of commitment which is an Innovative tool developed by Geneva code that allows armed groups to publicly pledge respect for humanitarian norms and then be held accountable for their commitments so often these commitments go beyond legal obligations and Beyond um IHL per se and include also a range of good practices so in that sense the deed of commitment is signed by the leadership of the Armed groups and is counter-signed by Geneva pool as a witness to their commitment and also signed by the government of the Republic of the Quantum of Geneva as a custodian so the idea is really to try and and bring some visibility to the group's commitment to these humanitarian Norms where the subsequent follow-up from the side of Geneva cool looking at the implementation of the state of commitment on the ground so last year we developed a new deed of commitment on starvation and in the process we also consulted armed groups on the content and it is maybe interesting for you to know that all of the respondents have actually flagged environmental degradation and the impact of food security as a major concern mostly in relation to the contamination of agricultural fields and Water Resources so look did the Deeds of commitment of Geneva cool are one of the tools that we use but we also have other tools that we can rely on to engage with arm groups um one of them may be um the review of their internal rules and regulations this can include their codes of conducts um we support them maybe with looking at their internal orders for instance but also we we are um looking at ways to um strengthen their commitment maybe through unilateral declarations or helping them and establishing internal mechanisms to ensure that they can comply with with ihn so in that sense um I I want to give a couple of examples of um areas or armed groups we've engaged with in the past for example in Mali the mnla has included which is a move more for the liberation of azawad they have included in their code of conduct the protection of the environment as well for example the chin National front which is a group active in Myanmar they have also included a provision um that that actually prohibits the use of weapon that can damage the environment over and and just to make sure that these are avoided um so the use of weapons that can damage the environment over a long time should be avoided and this is something that they have included in their internal policies moreover on groups that exercise control over territories often often also set up administrative structures to safeguard the environment more generally and it is interesting that in that context armed groups have also flagged that the conflict in itself is also often an obstacle to Environmental Protection and we need to keep that as well in mind so I think Vanessa referred to that thing that conflict environmental degradation and climate crisis exacerbate each other and that's also something that armed groups have have brought forward as well so maybe um as a conclusion looking at at our workers as Geneva cool um I think it's important to recognize that legal Frameworks are a vehicle for strengthening protection but there's also a need to engage in a discussion um while looking at different Frameworks of reference um this could be for example reference to religious values that can be used to reinforce the messaging for instance Islamic Norms that protect the environment are often used by armed Bruce as an example to show how protective Islamic rules of War actually are moreover um act as often so armed groups and the factor authorities often bear a sense of responsibility for the territories they govern or the population living in their areas so how can we build on that as well and and also not forgetting the local and Indigenous ways of protecting the environment which can be reinforced in many of the contexts so I think um Vanessa has also outlined the idea of looking also at the different aspects that drive some of the activities it may be for economical reasons or um or other um aspects that may have to be considered so really understanding the interests of armed actors um and and trying to couple that with the interest to protect the environment and see how we can Bridge um bridge the gap in terms of protection of the environment so I will stop here um and happy to take questions okay thank you a lot um great with some practical examples as well for about how different groups deal with this question I I can say actually that we we're preparing uh another policy brief on on exactly this issue we'll try to look look in different places to see how different um groups actually position themselves or if they position themselves in relation to the environment um while we're waiting for more questions there is I mean and we're talking about non-state armed groups I think maybe we could there's a question for for uh Vanessa actually about how the icrc currently or in future planning seek to incorporate these guidelines into their advocacy to non-state Armed groups what efforts exist to begin to train them on these expectations so could let's let's ask Vanessa and we'll return to to EBA sure and thank you Heber as well it was really great great to hear of these practical examples um I would maybe give apologies I believe that the doorbell is ringing in my house um how exciting um so for the in terms of what the icrc is planning to do we have a unit which we called our Armed Forces Unit and their primary purpose is to engage with weapon bearers they typically do this with State militaries but they also do it with non-state armed groups and generally what they do is train them on IHL or well and or on specific thematics related to IHL so as part of our rollout of the guidelines on the environment we developed a presentation specifically on the environment which our Armed Forces delegates can use with both state militaries and with non-state armed groups and sort of adapt depending on the level and the capacity of the group I would say very realistically that what that looks like is one or two slides which just clarified that the environment needs to be considered when groups are fighting recalling the prohibition of pillage um really building in at a fairly basic level the fact that the environment shouldn't be damaged as groups fight and should be a consideration that they take into account as they do civilians schools hospitals and so forth so um we're integrating it I would say mainstreaming it in that way in our dialogue and the second thing is that Heber mentioned which I think is a really interesting piece of work that um is very relevant to many of the conflicts that the icrc works on is exploring the protection of the environment through Islamic law and Islamic principles and we have a colleague Dr Ahmad Al dawoodi who is the icrc advisor on Islamic law who has been working precisely on elaborating how Islamic law does take the environment into account um specifically in the law of armed conflict and has held a couple of workshops with Islamic scholars on that issue precisely because it is a topic that that speaks to many of the Armed groups that in the context where we work thank you Vanessa um there is a question I think it is for for yuhiba um it says is there already an Implement any implementation of local practices into the protection of the environment now you gave some examples of of um of more like doctrines of of some armed groups but these are actually also some practices we all heard also before that that there is insufficient actual practice to to actually make a big thing out of it but but I guess that that's where we're going exactly so I think I think it's it's I I have I have mentioned a couple of examples where there were already some policy um commitments I would say in terms of the protection of the environment but we are also continuously looking into um the ways we can really implement it in practice and this may look different um in the different context right so um in contexts where where um we are more engaged with the group and have been engaging for a longer period of time it may be different than with groups with uh with whom we've just recently started engaging so this is something that as I said is we don't have currently a standalone thematic on on the environment so it's a bit difficult to pinpoint um some of the implementation that that may have um occurred but we are really prioritizing that over um the next couple of years at least within the Mana region I can I can say that this is a high priority um for us and um and obviously the implementation will look different for each group also depending on their capacities depending also on the level of control they have in a certain territory um so but concretely um I could not give a concrete examples at this moment about um some specific implementation um so hopefully in in the coming couple of years we will have more examples that could also lead to um maybe a no longer run or so looking at guidelines that can really support that work as well thank you very much I I guess it's also a question of actually having the the focus on on these practices so they they might be there but but but nobody would have you know seen or discussed it um I think Jairo might have a question for you yes thank you Hiba for the interesting talk I would like to ask you um about the acronyms uh you know like use the Geneva code started using a arm loans stay armed on state group I'm sad then you hope you jump into the non-state arm groups and now you're using this arm groups and the factual authorities yeah acronym can you tell me a bit more what's behind all these uh developments in in letters i um and how do they resonate with the language used in in you know in legal policy developments by the icrc and the principles as well thank you that's the first one I have a several more yes thank you so Geneva cool has been around for over 20 years now and we have started with the word or the acronym Anza which is our non-state actor and it was really centered around the idea of clarifying that we do not engage um per se with State militaries right so now after 20 years and and looking at the really the diverse landscape of armed actors present in the various areas where we operate um and also how they perceive themselves um we we have looked at the need to maybe reframe um the way we address these actors so rather than really pinpointing that there are non-states we try to to refer back to IHL terminologies which usually refer to organized armed groups and hence we are back at the terminology which is more considered also more neutral um of just saying armed groups rather than armed non-state uh actors and obviously looking at at many of the actors we engaged with across the region um in the Mena region but also in other parts of the world is also the fact that they see themselves as even more than de facto authorities so we maybe so they see themselves as as the government they really have control um over white parts of the territory and and the big number um of a white part of the population as well so in that sense um really trying to revert back to a more neutral approach without us classifying them as state or non-state and really referring to the fact that they are armed and oftentimes also that they that they do exercise a certain level of of authority and that sense the responsibilities also have to align so this is where um the um revisiting of the terminology is coming from but obviously this was a long process um and and we have consulted many of our stakeholders in in that sense and this is where we are at today so um rather than using Ansa which is our non-state actors we are now using agda which is armed groups and de facto authorities thank you very much um maybe Haru just one more small question for IBA and then we go to the general question I asked you were a question actually would that be a within the bounds of the reason um yeah just a question about implementation of these policies generally with the groups and authorities that you work with so we've seen examples of where a de facto Authority will make a very Progressive environmental statement for a particular audience like in our new convention for the country we will set up and support protected areas for example and then simultaneously in the course of the ongoing conflict they will have much more dubious environmental behavior and environmental conduct and I guess you know National authorities and deflector authorities are not monolithic but there's potentially less sort of policy cohesion in less organized groups and do you find that to be a particular problem for trying to promote IHL implementation and others with with such groups and how do you get around it we've been around engaging on a various range of thematics and I think we can apply what has been in the past also to the potential engagement on the protection of their environment so as you said it really depends on on the structure of the group and how they are motivated right so that also links into are they really organized and then and then the the command structure is such that if there is a decision at the top everyone will be implementing it or is it more Loosely structured um and how do they operate around that so there is an assessment of of the the typology of the group I would say and then how can we really address the issues that we know will come up um if it's a more Loosely structured group how can we really address that um and then the other way around if it's a bit easier because there is a clear guidance and then a clear internal mechanism to monitor um this is really it's the ideal scenario right and we try to to in any case when we engage we try to reach an air at least a minimum of of follow-up from our site but also the internal ownership of of the process um so so sometimes you have to go around looking for religious Norms sometimes more social norms sometimes also with the support of the communities in those areas being those affected and and they can also have an impact so we don't only engage with our groups also often are involved in the community and and these accountability efforts let's say um so but really the the it may be varied across um the countries and the actors we we engage with um so how we move around it is really a good assessment of what's the situation and what are the issues we may encounter and then a Frank um an open discussion with these actors about these issues and understanding the underlying causes and how we can address them because if and and you know if they are willing to to take that step and we can support in that that you know that's what we really try to do with our transparent humanitarian engagement getting to the root causes of what's actually the issue and how can we support to remedy cool thank you very much okay thank you let's go to the uh General dust end of the session um there is one question for all the panelists so it says what about your experience of media and taking up the issue the median art and taking out the issue both playing an important implementation role for example through film festivals so who would like to start I give the floor to Doug thanks Vanessa um uh yeah I remember just um thinking about General Media interest in this topic um so over the years that we've been working um but yeah obviously I think Ukraine's something of an outlier right because it's very visible it's had such just kind of profound political effect regionally at least for us in in Europe um but in terms of the the media narrative and the amount of visibility um you know I think with each conflict that comes along there's a greater level of visibility around all the issues in the conflict and particularly environmental issues and that's changed quite dramatically over the last 10 20 years and I think the Ukraine we're almost seeing like the latest peak of that visibility for these issues and that's translated into a great deal of media interest and that's been fantastic for bringing visibility is conflicting the environment which isn't generally a priority for a lot of people when they think about conflicts because their people don't make the connection but it's the environment is a humanitarian issue um so in that respect I think ensuring particularly if the environment which tends to be neglected ensuring that it has media coverage and attention in popular media but also potentially in art and another four months then yeah I think it's vitally important for the topic more generally and certainly for any hoped for implementation of rules to protect the environment because if we're not aware of these issues and impacts then people aren't going to see the value in implementing these rules so what about you Hippa well how does it look from in the Middle East is there any you know public discussion or awareness or interest in these issues um generally speaking I think there there is a global Trend I would say but if we're trying to to link it a little bit more to our work I think there is a lot of attention when armed groups are willing to to pledge um you know for example um to take specific steps towards the protection or humanitarian Norms in general and this would include also the protection of um of the environment so I think more generally in the Mana region if I if I want to just highlight more globally I think there is an interest obviously in in Environmental Protection and it has come to the Forefront how conflict is actually exacerbating some of some of the issues and we have a lot of issues around access to water for example as well in the area in our region which are often very mediatized and very politicized so um I think this is an issue that we will see more and more in media so now I think the question was also referring to film festivals and I think that's that's a very good way to to bring attention to some of the the aspects unfortunately that's it's a bit far from from the type of work that that I do personally although I think there there would be a um an added value and also bringing the the diverse um areas together um to to advocate for those for those humanitarian um issues hey thank you um Vanessa you have anything to add maybe just briefly because Doug and Heber really covered the most important points I think I think that another place that increased media attention is coming from is the climate crisis and that's very positive because the climate and environment crisis are very much interlinked but often the climate crisis takes more space so I think for us as a community of practitioners it's about looking for the link between climate and environment and making the point that they're very much interconnected in how they affect civilians and they certainly overlap but they're not exactly the same and they need slightly different poly or slightly more policy policy responses so yeah I would say it's very certainly more interesting the media including because of the climate crisis and and the fact that that is being quite well covered certainly not enough but there's more attention and just making the point that the environment should be understood as a part of that and and conflict as being really the front lines of both of those things that countries affected by conflict are on the front lines of environmental degradation of of the climate crisis as well okay thank you very much um we have one question maybe of a more legal character so it says what is the interaction between the the um the principle the product principles and the development of equal side and rights of nature legislation I guess you and as I might have something to say there that's a that's a really good question and it maybe speaks to the fact that there's so much attention globally on the environment at the moment um and that's a really positive thing and it's about trying to harness it into into real policy change at National level so on eco side I would say first of all to understand about ecocide is that it's broader than armed conflicts so the general discussion that is being spoken about for example in the context of the ICC statute and the sort of drafts principles on or the draft definition of ecocide is broader than armed conflict so these principles um that we are speaking about at the ilc are are linked to conflicts or are more narrow with that said the ilc principles um do speak about ecoside in the commentary um specifically when they speak I think it's principle 13 or one of the principles on principle nine on state responsibility speaks generally about accountability for environmental harms and it's about State responsibility not individual responsibility like ecoside but it does say that it's without prejudice to any criminal liability relevant to individuals for environmental harm so it speaks about ecocide as a potential way for accountability to be put in place at domestic level in the commentary on principle nine and from the icrc perspective the principle three of the ilc principles speaks about States taking effective legislative administrative judicial and other measures to enhance the protection of the environment in their domestic context so taking their International obligations and putting them into their domestic law so that they can be enforced that Eco side might be one way that a state interprets how it wants to do that so how it wants to interpret its International obligations into its domestic law it would be broader than armed conflict but nevertheless it could cover armed conflict and indeed some states have already done that so some states in particular the the post uh rather previously USSR States many of them have ecocide within their domestic law as a crime against peace so I would say ecoside is linked to the principles in that way it could be interpreted um to be one way that principle 3 is put into practice in domestic contexts and then separately on the rights of nature it's such a good question and I would say you know the rights of nature in my understanding is about the fact that the environment might have legal personality in and of itself separate from humans so an intrinsic value to the environment not an anthropocentric approach that only values the environment for how it is useful to humans and I would say that there are many principles in in the ilc's work that reflect that intrinsic value of the environment I think for the icrc that is our approach in the conduct of hostility rules that the environment is civilian in character regardless of whether a human is living on it today so it is intrinsically intrinsically protected as civilian in character and I would say specifically with regard to you can tell that I'm sort of scrolling through the principles right now I um principle 12 which is the Martens clause speaks about in cases not covered by International agreement the environment remains under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience and public conscience is something that evolves with time and that's where I think the rights of nature that's perhaps where we would see it develop under the dictates of public conscience and how the environment is protected by the dictates of public conscience in time to come it might be that it's in the commentary I'm not sure thanks okay or doc you have anything to add it was a very extensive solid answer um maybe just um yeah two things I suppose one is that the parent principles are you know they've been developed every pretty much the last 10 years but they're in some ways like a snapshot of what we were talking about so the international law Commission it's codification and it's Progressive development so they can codify what's already there and in some areas they can progressively develop some things so for example the principle I talked about earlier about business operations in areas affected by conflict which is a little bit edgy Progressive development um but at the time there wasn't the definition of equal side during the process where the ilc were developing the principles and again the rights of nature debate was kind of just discussing so it wasn't something which could be included in the principles themselves but it kind of speaks to this point about our constantly evolving understanding of the environment and the need to make sure that the policies and protections that we give the environment in relation to conflict is also constantly evolving and so the LC principles are kind of a foundation stone but again we have to build on it we have to keep this conversation going because there are these fields of laws and approaches which are always developing and could be applied to conflict settings okay thank you um I think time is running out so it might be hard to start on a new round of questions and we don't have any more from the audience so I think I'll leave it here and thank the panelists for sharing your your insights and your your knowledge and also to hire monive for organizing this event thank you very much cool thank you very much thank you everybody thank you thank you thank you very much
2D9IWBVoCV0,The UN Security Council: Maintaining international peace after the invasion,"As the war in Ukraine is about to enter its second year, the UN Security Council is struggling to act decisively in the face of increased great power rivalry and the hardening conflict with Russia. This is driven by the institutionalized power of the five permanent members which allows them to not only veto decisions but to influence the agenda of the UNSC or undermine UN activities by withholding funding. In this context, Denmark has launched its candidacy for the UN Security Council in 2025-2026 but what can small states hope to achieve as elected members of the UN Security Council? 

This event will explore strategies available to non-permanent elected members of the UN Security Council to exert influence. It will point to examples and strategies available to single elected members-states, particularly the lessons-learned by Norway during its 2021-2022 UNSC membership, but also explore the potential of increased collaboration within the group of elected members (the so-called E10) to influence the UNSC agenda.

Photo: © UN Photo/Laura Jarriel",1,good afternoon and welcome to this seminar focusing on the U.N security Council maintaining International Peace after the invasion which is a big question lots to discuss and I think we also posted a bit provocative my name is Cecilia Felicia stockham Bank I'm the head of the foreign policy and diplomacy unit here at these I'm very happy to see you here this afternoon um and I will do this a very short introduction and then give the word to our speakers a year into Russia's in a war in Ukraine and with the UN Security Council caught up in great power rivalry during this seminar we will explore strategies available to non-permanent Electric Memphis of the U.N security Council to exert influence as the war in Ukraine is about to enter its second year the U.N security Council is struggling to act decisively in the face of increase increased great power rivalry and the hardening conflict with Russia um the council is driven by institutionalized power of the five permanent members which allows them to act oh sorry them to not only veto our decisions but to influence the agenda of the UN Security Council or undermine U.N activities by withholding funding it is in this context that Denmark has launched its candidacy for the U.N security Council in 2025 2026 but what can small states hope to achieve as elected members of the U.N security councils Council and what more generally can the U.N at this point where only few would mention other strategies than the military when it comes to Ukraine we just come from a small session uh where we had a discussion on this extremely difficult question because how far are we from using diplomatic tools I think that's the overall question of this session however during this seminar we will Express explore strategies available to non-permanent Electric members of the U.N security Council to exert influence the seminar will point to examples and strategies available to single elected member states particularly the lessons learned by Norway during its 2021-2022 U.N security Council membership but also explore the potential or increased collaboration within the group of electric members the so-called e-10 to influence the U.N security Council agenda we are very very delighted and happy and pleased to have with us today the president of the International Peace Institute also known as EP in New York with us today said was Jordan's representative to the UN from 20 200 to 20 2007 sorry 2000 to 2007 an ambassador to the United States between 2007 and 2010. he played a key role in the establishment of the international criminal court and served as the un's High Commissioner for human rights from 2014 to 2018. Saeed uh I hope it's okay I use your first first name yeah you have an extensive knowledge of peacekeeping serving in different U.N peacekeeping missions and is a professor of practice of Law and human rights at the University of Pennsylvania for the Norwegian experience we have nilsnagel who's here yeah from the Norwegian nupi the Norwegian foreign policy Institute our sister Institute up in Oslo with us Nils is a senior research fellow head of new peace research group on security and defense and head of new Peace Center on digitalization and cyber security studies together safely through this next hour and it's a little less than an hour now my colleague Maria luisi Klausen senior researcher at the D's and responsible for our U.N program will moderate decision please note that we are on live stream and that the seminar will be available afterwards at ds.dk following the session again welcome uh for this afternoon's seminar I hope to see you soon again here at the diis please we will start with the U directly yeah go for it well thank you [Music] is it on now okay so we start again okay okay there we go all good all right so again delighted to be here thank you cecili for uh welcoming us together with my vice president Adam lapel and our head of research um Jenna Russo we're delighted to be here fresh from uh Munich and um I just saying and I'll repeat it that my first encounter with uh Danish involvement in uh in the UN was when I was a peacekeeper in the former Yugoslavia in 1994 and at the end of that year the head of the mission asked me if I could do some research and why it is that some U.N peacekeeping battalions were being picked on attacked and others were not and so they wanted me he wanted me to look at return rates of fire in other words when a battalion is attacked how do they respond proportionately not respond at all so I spent about four or five days compiling all the evidence and I came to the realization very quickly that the country with the or the Battalion that was the most robust in responding to any act on it was the Danish Battalion so if there were two shots fired at the Danish Battalion the Danes returned 500 rounds of machine gun fire RPGs rocket fire and then the next Battalion was the Nordic Battalion so between the Danes and the nordics you know very robust and uh and that gave me a sort of indication of where the nordics how they approach these sorts of issues I also you know just saying I I also had the enormous privilege of working with many outstanding Danish ambassadors um Alan Loy who was not just a permanent representative of Denmark in the security Council 2005-2006 but then represented the UN in Liberia and South Sudan was just tremendous this and I then worked with a cost and Starr who was equally both in New York and Geneva very gifted diplomats so Denmark has brilliant Representatives fronting its foreign policy in terms of the security Council and what is possible in the next year to two as Denmark prepares itself hopefully unopposed and I think it's unopposed at the moment to take a seat in the security Council 2025-2026. I think it's worth reflecting first of all in terms of the performance on Ukraine thus far and of course we will hear from Niels also on this the first point to make was there was a dramatic failing in the council's inability to prevent the conflict from happening in the first place it's very design is meant to prevent this sort of thing but the design has a form of course and the floor is the use of a veto by a permanent member that can stymie and obstruct any Collective action undertaken by the council now Norway in the first discussion about the Russian action once it happened pointed out another issue which I'm sure Nils would refer to that the charter is not altogether silent on the use of veto when it comes to actions of this sort and that there has to be perhaps a re-evaluation of that particular article 27 3 in light of what the Russians have you know have committed the second commentary is that once the war started the council seemed to be unable to stop it for the same reason no while 40 about 40 debates were held over the last year maybe even more only one so-called product was arrived at a presidential statement in May of last year commending Antonio Gutierrez for his diplomacy in trying to use the Black Sea grain deal to some somehow Forge a discussion beyond that no resolution was adopted by the security Council on this issue plenty of open chamber meetings but hardly any now informal consultations and I think for any of you who follow the security Council that's quite important when I was serving in the security Council in 2014 most of the meetings I attended were informal consultations the small room the delegations are packed together around the table it's much more intimate you may disagree but you sort of develop a a sort of sense of community even if you disagree at the moment they do meet in the small room but most of the meetings are in the big chamber that the public always sees and then you have speeches so everyone's playing to the gallery but not often talking to one another or maybe talking to another one another but very in very terrorist terrorist language this of course now is counterbalanced by what we're seeing as a rise and this has been the case now for a number of years the rise in the dynamic activity of the elected members of the security Council and IPI and here I'm going to do some some promotion we commissioned this wonderful researcher Arthur brutilis to update a report that he produced earlier on the workings of the E10 the elected 10 members of the security Council and I commend you to have a look at it it's a it's a terrific publication basically in in this publication he explains how there's been an evolution of the way in which the elected members have seen themselves and how they've decided to really focus on some of the working methods of the security Council to improve them and this was not always the case first of all the members we referred to as the non-permanent members for a long time when I joined the The Diplomatic Corps in 1996 we were referring to them as non-permanent members and that changed in the early 2000s there was also an emphasis at the time on the composition of the security Council and there were two groups by and large what was called the G4 supporting the accession of four countries the brics countries if you will and then you had the like-minded group which were opposing them and then a smaller group called the S5 decided to focus on just the working methods even though the S5 was divided between the two groups and then this then developed into What's called the act and there was work done on the use of the sort of use or let's say the restraint when it came to the use of veto in with respect to atrocity crime crimes and then this all folded into an activism which we see today I'd like to think that I also had played a small part in January 2014 Jordan joined the security Council Luxembourg and Australia had already seized this pen so to speak on on Syria humanitarian and this point I think is also borne out in our report that up until about 2003 or four while it was generally understood the P3 the permanent three I.E France UK and the US would occasionally be drafting the resolutions coming before the SEC Security Council it became more formalized with this idea that there was for every item agenda item there was a a formal pen the formal scribe and when we joined the council in 2014 already Luxembourg and Australia had taken what was taking the pen from the UK and then the Russians said if the UK still hold on to this pen we are not going to we're not going to agree on anything relating to Syria humanitarian they came to us we were just joining and so we took we joined them with the pen and from that moment on we've seen a proliferation in the actions by the elected members to take the pen on a number of key issues and to develop the agenda further whether it be on cyber security climate change to water for example you had this sort of widening of the envelope and a greater authorship of what the security Council was prepared to do and then there were Innovations of other sorts for instance if a particular resolution was coming up for Renewal the pen holder would begin to talk to the neighboring countries and if the pen holder was a neighboring country it would perhaps to undertake a visit to the region in question and this was something dramatic because it hadn't happened before you usually you have a visit by the council as a council Security Council to a region and then they come out so what has happened in the last few years is there's been a dynamism an activism which which I think speaks very highly to the possibility that in the future we can see a further evolution of this in the past well I should just add as well there is now um perhaps and the report makes it clear an overuse of What's called the Aria formula the sort of the informal meetings where you could bring in people to brief which in formal settings you could never do um and uh there's been so much of this practice that our report suggests and a number of Security Council Members have said that this is now overused and they're tired of it one of the points that always stuck in my mind was that Diego Aria the the permanent representative of Venezuela in 1994 1992 1993 had a had two Aria formulas that he started one area formula was the one that I've just referred to these informal meetings of the security Council but there was another RF formula that no one has repeated and that was that during the Bosnian crisis he went to Bosnia in his capacity as ambassador of Venezuela not in his capacity as member of the security Council or president of the security Council as ambassador of Venezuela but when he was in Bosnia everyone treated him as a member of the security Council it was so clever and it hasn't been used since I you know thought to myself later I I was a fool when I was president of the security Council in 2014 in January and South Sudan had just exploded why didn't I just go I could have taken two days off flown and just gone and seen myself and it's that sort of innovation which if I'm incapable of thinking of that I hope you know if it's not Denmark other elected members will will promote of course in due course and then finally just a couple of last points I think it is important that Security Council Members the elected members continue to ask searching questions in a probing questions you know how was it why was it that the UN was so quiet in the weeks leading up to Putin's attack on Ukraine you know he was making these allegations and his group was making these allegations about Kiev being have been taken over by fascists and that these special military Opera Mini military operations which of course that's what the lady was were called but insinuating that something would need would need to be done and the U.N should have on a daily basis said that this is complete nonsense there's no causes belly none the question is why didn't they say it and why didn't council members ask is there causes belly here or not if you don't have the U.N say anything then the Russians say something and then the U.S and the Western countries oppose and everyone else is watching this as if it is between two competing groups with the UN silent and not saying anything there is a role for the elected members in asking searching questions about what needs to be done the Secretary General once the war happened or started was courageous spoke out openly and clearly about what was happening in Ukraine and I think this must continue in 12 days time the Human Rights Council in Geneva opens its March session and the commission of inquiry on Ukraine formerly called The Independent International Commission on inquiry will be presenting its findings I mean the anticipation of the findings going are going to be Stark maybe not as surprising as some would suppose but it could be and there we hope that the statements will be very clear and very concise as to what is required I think also it could Galvanize the elected membership in terms of what we see happening out of Munich and we can talk about this further the European leaders seem to be surprised that there was some hesitancy from some countries in the Global Science most particularly for instance from South Africa or even India when it comes to not standing squarely next to Ukraine but the reasons that we heard were not all together without any foundation that seems to be some justification that must also be heard although it's hard for the mind to comprehend how can you be ambivalent but they're not really ambivalent they have sort of condemned but they are also watching and for very strategic reasons they're making deductions as well and so I think here it could be extremely interesting and then there is this position of the argument of double standards from the global South that some countries were put forward um and we have today before the security Council the possibility I think the probability of a vote being taken in respect of israel-palestine I the Arab group uh I believe are presenting a draft resolution for adoption and it would be interesting to see where the United States votes on this traditionally it's always vetoed it you know in the past under Obama it sort of went abstention and if let's say it went to veto again because we're running up to the start of the presidential elections then in a few days time we have another resolution in the general assembly on Ukraine and what can we expect there in the end I would venture the critical thing for the UN and for elected members of the security Council to emphasize and I think it can make a huge difference in the next year to two years it's sort of moral consistency we if whatever we decide when it comes to Ukraine we have to use the same yardstick in other circumstances perhaps not as dramatic not as egregious not as obvious less obvious but still it needs a principled position and we stick to the law as opposed to transactional politics when it comes to the security Council and I think if that's the case Denmark will be moving in at precisely the right time when it needs to be there and as I said at the beginning no one messes with Denmark thank you so um thank you very much for these interesting thoughts and perspectives I'm just gonna go straight ahead and give the word to our next speaker Nils and ask you to turn on your microphone thank you sure is it online can you hear me yep uh got the thumbs up so I think it's on yeah good okay thank you very much I'm very happy to be here um to talk about the topic that I'm very interested in I actually did the anthropological field work in the U.N security Council 20 years ago last time Norway was part of the security Council I did that for my master thesis and since then I've been following and paying attention to what the Security Council is doing from time to time more or less yeah and the last two years I've been following very closely what the security Council has been doing through Norway's role as a elected member state in this Council because we in in [Music] a in connection with this Norway's membership we established a dialogue Forum in Norway in order to strengthen Norway's knowledge based foreign politics in the security Council so the purpose with that dialogue Forum was to get the best researchers that we could find for round tables eight round tables in total on topics that were particularly interesting for Norway to work on while in the security Council so this could be planned ahead but this could also be a planned very sudden if there was something happening in the world so through this this role this is where my perspective on the security Council comes from and I I very much agree to the story that was told by you now and of course the Security Council is not perfect it has its flaws I could also add that in addition to the veto the its tools are also kind of not not enough so to speak at least if you look at the situation we're in right now but I'll come out I will come back to to that and the last year much has been said about uh [Music] about the floss in the security Council uh there's been a lot of the the tensions between the P5 has increased the last 10 years more difficult internal Dynamics and this peaked 24th of February last year almost exactly one year ago and and intermediate aftermath after the Innovation Ukraine Russian invasion of Ukraine you could read the international media headlines talking about or saying that the the U.N security Council or the Russian war in Ukraine has put the U.N security Council into an existential crisis uh others were saying that for instance like the Kenyan U.N Ambassador was saying that the multilateral listen lies on its death bed tonight uh and you could say that much of this is is in a way true but um but there are also important nuances I think to that story and in my talk today I I would actually like to focus uh on the things that works and and in particular I want to focus on three things um uh and through those things I will argue that I I don't think the Security Council is paralyzed I think it's I don't think it's in an existential crisis rather or actually on the contrary I think it has shown strengths and ability to navigate Rough Waters in an international crisis of historical dimensions and the three things that I would like to focus on there is the real the the the new in a way relation between you or not new but renewed in a way a relation between the general assembly and the security Council and the security council's function as a meeting place and its ability to make decisions I'll come back to that but I will also um I was also asked to say a little bit about the Norway's role in the in the security Council and its strategy so I'll try to run through those uh okay so so our just to just to say that the Norway's priorities was um to focus on protection of civilians women peace and security climate security and peace diplomacy and it also had a couple of already got every country every elected member state gets a couple of or takes a couple of responsibilities when you joined the the security Council and for norways role this was I would say quite heavy UH responsibilities with a lot of work and yeah and that was uh the pen holder for Afghanistan and also for the humanitarian situation in Syria with at that time was a lot of great power interests in those two topics also where uh Norway was also the co-chair of with Kenya with an f4 on climate Security in in 2022 and we or say we have a Norway was also the chair of the sanction committee on North Korea and on Iceland Al Qaeda as well as responsibilities in couple of expertise groups and the major topics through the two two years was first it was covet actually the meetings were held on teams and and we were Norway was thinking that this was going to be really the main thing to tell to talk about after the membership was over that Norway was in the security Council during covet and they didn't know the diplomats didn't meet each other and just the teams and then in September 2021 Afghanistan collapsed and a couple of weeks after that the Mandate for Afghanistan the U.N mandate was supposed to be renewed and Norway was the pen holder for that and I had to do a lot of uh diplomacy to get that in place and then less than half here after that Russia went to war in in Ukraine and we all know and so that was that was the context for the Norwegian membership and so people often ask me what was the most important achievements of Norway during those two years and I think it's it's actually it depends on what how you how you talk about the achievements but uh I would I would actually like to highlight a couple of things one of them is that Norway was making an effort in order to hold the Diplomatic doors or the Diplomatic channels open so Norway talked with even with Russia and the other other countries while in the security Council when the P3 did not and a couple of weeks after uh 24th of February the animation a new mandate it was not supposed to be renewed but it was a new mandate for Afghanistan was going to be adopted and Norway did was like I said a pen holder for that and that was just a couple of weeks after and was very very [Music] realism or there was really um reason to believe that this was going to be very very difficult and of course it probably was but it was adopted and I think that that was also a good thing it was of course not only Norway's Norway's uh responsibility that that happened but Norway had a finger on the wheel in that case and uh another one was that Norway also was the pen holder for Syria but it was perhaps the next test of the security Council with uh with great power interest in in Syria as well it was a really difficult negotiations on on renewing that mandate and in the end on over time we were able to adopt that so yeah and I could also say add that since I did the field work on Northwest role in 20 20 21 and 22 um 20 years ago I would just say that one thing that I could compare between those what happened in those 20 years is that the role of the elected member states is a much more important because 20 years ago the big issue then was uh [Music] September 11 happened eight months after nine months after and now we joined the council and the big issue really big issue was September 11 and Iraq of course weapons Declaration of Iraq and everything in in that had to do with that and this was only dealt with by the P5 and almost only by the US and Norway was not it was not no no point in trying to do anything on that case back then but now you see when Norway joined this time they got responsibility as a pen holder for uh um Afghanistan and for Syria which was great power interests in those two cases back then all right uh I see it when it's flying so I'll just jump over a couple of things yeah so I want to uh we can come back if you have questions about the Norwegian membership I could talk more about that later but I want to jump now to my second part which is to what extent was uh the security Council has been to what extent has it been useful or you useless in 2022 and up until now so the first thing I want to say that even in the security in Security Council context uh 2022 has been a very difficult year it's been in international crisis of historical dimensions and and how could the council deal with such a crisis when the aggressor was a P5 with veto it has mentioned tools it has a couple of tools the security Council to deal with things on the ground and that is it can decide on resolutions for Action it can negotiate it can mediate it can send special advisors to the field it can adopt sanctions and it can also deploy peace operations but in Ukraine and between Ukraine and Russia no not this tools the situation on the ground has not allowed for any of these tools to be deployed more or less so they they're not they haven't been very relevant could have of course adopted sanctions but that that's not possible when Russia is part of the security Council with a veto power so those tools that don't work very well but there's a another tool that I mean that that I think is very very important and that has worked quite well and that is the security Council as a meeting place or as in a way a catwalk for international politics where where things uh are happening and you know I say that it's a meeting place for the diplomats to meet but it also it is also a catwalk so that every once or at least the one who are interested in international politics and what's going on here they can follow the meetings because it's they are broadcasted and they are recorded So it's documented for history in a way and that is actually very important I think and there has the security Council has of course not been able to adopt any meaningful resolutions on Ukraine but it is the perhaps the only place or it is the only place in the global place where Ukraine and Russia is and the the 14 other member states so the Security Council is meeting regularly to discuss the situation in Ukraine uh and I don't think we should underestimate this because the situation is on the ground we of course it would have been a very good in theory if if the security Council was able to adopt a resolution that said let's throw Russia out of Ukraine um or and stop just to stop the war but how would that be done in practice because the U.N does not have a military to do that and even NATO they don't want to go into Ukraine and and join the war for real so so I think that okay the situation on the ground is very difficult right now it's difficult to do things you have to um try to get there to a certain point where it's possible to do things but but in the meantime it's very important what's happening in the security Council I think it's it puts it it the pressure on Russia remains and it puts the topic on the agenda and and I think that's important but it also has a certain it is also a difficulty because it is a balance point here whether to what extent should the security Council Focus all its resources on Ukraine and there's a lot of other conflicts happening all across the world uh so that's that's a balance point and uh should not exhaust the security Council too much but it is also important to maintain pressure and and focus on what's Happening and I would also like to say that uh yeah so oh yeah I have to jump to that okay two minutes okay so um let's see uh yeah so the security Council has um so the relation between the the first important thing that I was going to uh the three important things the first one is the relation between the general assembly and the security Council and that has been strengthened in 2022 by uh one thing that has been called uniting for peace that was uh used once again in order to when the security Council was not able to adopt a resolution or anything on on condemnation of Russia it sent that decision to the general assembly to do it for for the security Council so it was the security Council that made the general assembly to do this and instead of 15 member states voting it was 193 and 141 of those supported or voted against Russia and four countries voted for Russia and then there was a lot of some countries in between that abstained so that was that made all these 50 all these 193 States they had to publicly announce their their position on the war in Ukraine instead of 15 states in the security Council so that is I think it's a something that has improved the security Council in a way at least through the relation between the general assembly and Security Council and then you have also the Lichtenstein proposal which in which says that it was it had Lichtenstein had tried to get this proposal adopted for 18 years and and they did it also two years ago or three years ago and it was impossible to do it but last year it was possible and it the least time proposal it has it says that if you if one of the V2 Powers makes use of the veto you have to come to the they have to come go to the general assembly and explain why and after they have explained why all the 193 member states they can they can comment on what they think about the use of Ito which was not possible before so everyone all the states can actually now say what they think about the The veto and I think that is a democratizing the the security Council and and the veto and making things more transparent I think it's a thing that is it's a good thing to add to the story about good things uh it makes the threshold a little bit higher for to use the way to power and then yeah uh so it was the three things was the relation between the general assembly and the security Council it was the security Council as the meeting meeting place it has been over more than 50 meetings in 2022 about Ukraine more than one meeting meeting a week I think and I also think that it's important to look at the if you want to look at to what extent the Security Council is paralyzed or not it's the last Point number three it's the number of resolutions so if you compare the number of resolutions in 2021 with the number of resolutions in 2022 it's almost the same so while you can say that there has been some spillover effect on effects from Russia and Ukraine two other to to the rhetorics and the internal Dynamics in the security Council this pillar effect has not been has not done anything with the security council's decision making efficiency in a way yeah I'll stop there okay great thank you for almost keeping the time um so we have uh about 15 17 minutes for uh questions depending on which you're looking at um please keep your questions short and say your or introduce yourself um and I'll do a round of three questions and so both of you can have a chance to reply as you please and I'll start with hence [Music] I'm from this house here I wonder I know that the chances of mediation are not the best to say it mildly in in the war but if you if you that I guess it's a question to both of you and and thank you for two excellent uh presentations actually but who would be who would be the most suitable mediator in the war would it be Mr Mr guterres or would it be an okay a nation-specific nation-state like China or turkey or what would be your suggestions in that question yes thank you I think there was someone over here do you know my name is tinuk hausa I'm a postdoc researcher here at these um and I was curious since we heard about the U.N security Council essentially functioning as some sort of catwalk for like a stage for the states to discuss and to meet and to talk which of course is positive I also couldn't help but think of the way that Russia has been using this or misused this by of course spreading false information recently I thought about the speech from Roger Waters who was invited so it also offers a lot of opportunity for for Russia to to misuse that space and I was curious since you follow this closely what has your been your impression to what extent this has been done systematically and whether you think it does damage to to the institution I think maybe we'll take these two questions and then you have a chance to think of more um I don't know if you want to start yeah both excellent questions um the mediation point I think is a very serious problem we have you know 50 years ago 40 years ago the U.N was always in the middle of a mediation always um and over time it's sort of relinquished that role to many more specialized smaller entities or groups of envoys from different countries and to the point now where it's barely visible I mean of course the Black Sea grain deal the UN sort of anchors that in my own experience serving in a peacekeeping mission where I was involved in the ceasefire talks in at the end of 1994 beginning of 1995. there were three threads we had to put together we had to stop the fighting on the ground temporarily we then had to stop the fighting on the ground for a longer period so cessation of hostilities and we had to find put a stop to the fighting permanently or it says semi-permanently through a connection to a contact group or two mediators one representing the U.N the other representing the European sort of European States if you can put it like that and the and there was a seamless sort of transition between the three so trying to get the effect on the ground more permanent and then you know I think now it's sort of more like a soup and it's not clear and that's why you've asked the question because it would be 20 30 years ago wouldn't even be asked it's so obvious that you and has the expertise the detailed institutional knowledge to do it so there has been a loss of its peacemaking function I think broadly speaking you know if you look at someone as the former president of icrc said to us back in September you know if you look back five years ago at all the conflicts raging and you look at the period today all those conflicts five years ago are still there none of them had been resolved really and we've added some more to them so the the system is not healthy there's something really not working very well you know the other point on Russian misuse I agree you know the Russians are extremely clever and using half truths and if you're not paying attention and you're listening to them you begin to believe that it's true and they point out all the double standards of which they themselves are also guilty and I think the point actually to make is that all countries practice double standards there's no country with a consistent voting record over decades where you could say this is entirely principle because trade relations play a role you know various private sector interest play a role defense contracts play a role it all plays a role but the way they manipulate the stage is actually frightening frighteningly effective one of the points made in Munich which I thought was an excellent point though was that there are governments that generally could be convinced that these arguments have merits but in a deep sense a lot of people in the global South in particular are disgusted by what they see that one country can just walk in and Destroy another like this but they also of course make the arguments that in the global South with many other conflicts for which there's seemingly this inattention we have an internal conflict in Myanmar and how many times do we read about Myanmar in the newspapers today and we hardly really if it wasn't for the earthquake in Syria we've almost lost any desire to look and see what's happening in Syria and Yemen the ceasefire collapsed last September and how many times a day do you read about Yemen or about Libya so you can understand this sort of this problem here what we really need is is deep solidarity North and South I think at one point that I mean niels's presentation was really excellent I think in terms of decision making one has to separate the standing agenda items of the UN which is almost mechanical you know when I if I was president in January in December I know exactly each day what agenda item we're going to deal with and we just you already have a Machinery in place I think the the thing is how do you deal with fresh crises can you resolve the fresh one that just emerges stop it early get them to disengage send in as you were saying the tools using the tools that are available and that sort of gives you a sense of where the vector is going are they improving their performance or not I think what speaks to the fact that in the worst you know worst year perhaps in recent times when it comes to the security Council it's the fact that they can get the standing items through is it speaks to the dynamism of the elected members because many of the many of these items have pen holders that are not the P3 essentially so that I think is goes well but can we resolve the next big crisis you know I think I I come from the Middle East I am very fearful in the next two months we're going to see a huge explosion in terms of israel-palestine and be a huge explosion now we know this is going to probably we have a strong feeling this is coming the council already should know this is coming what is it going to do it's not going to be surprised maybe it would be what is it going to do and I think that's the asset test for is it capable of dealing with these issues or not maintaining them yes but with difficulty and great credit must be played given to the elected members but stopping them preventing them resolving them I think this is this is where I am worried I think yeah um I really share your uh very nice there and um I think that uh one very important thing for the Security Council is to be able to shift or to adapt to shifting circumstances and if because it needs to stay relevant in a changing world and the threats to uh to International Peace and security is shifting continuously and and so the so a very important uh thing for the Security Council is to be able to adapt to a changing world and um one more thing about that because I could also add to the story about good things of the about the security Council here because the security Council has actually been able to adapt to a changing world for almost 80 years and it has been a very changing world through those years and if you compare it to the predecessor which was the legal Nations it wasn't there was a lot of things to say about the League of Nations that it has its its faults and and the great Powers they they opted out before it was even started some of them and uh but but it was dissolved after 25 years or something like that and the Security Council is still working and and adapting to to a changing world but it takes time and it has of course no guarantee that it is capable of changing to to new new situations and new threats but we we all need to hope that it does and and it's very important what kind of role the elected member states play in this in this part because the Security Council is never better than the sum of its member states um and about mediation I'll just share your views on that and I I don't think that I'm in a very good position to say very much about it actually okay I can say more about the catwalk question uh because uh I think you're totally right Russia is perhaps the one of the best in order to to make use so or to to platform its cases make use of the security Council to to platform its its cases and and and and do it like this so so but but nevertheless I think that um uh States diplomats all over the world and and people are following the the meetings and the talks recognize truths from false and also the the the if you if you listen to the Russian ambassadors talks in the security Council there's a lot of kind of uh let's say weird stuff that is being said uh and and so it reveals itself in a way to be honest and I talked with also for instance just I I was in doing field work in the security house in June last year and I met with the Ukraine un Ambassador and I thought that it was important to meet with him in order to ask him to what extent he he thought that the security Council was useful or useless for Ukraine and he really kept talking throughout the whole new thing about the the security the importance of the security Council for Ukraine and one of the things he mentioned there was the security Council as a meeting place uh where everyone could hear like he said the lies of the Russian Ambassador but that's of course up to everyone to to see and make their own opinion about that but everything that's being said here is broadcasted and it's being documented and it can be used by historians and everyone to do research for years to come thank you very much we are running out of time so if it's a very brief question we might take it there was the lady first I think very much can you hear me yeah um so I'll be very brief um I'm the new Irish ambassador to Denmark I've just come from Dublin where I was the UN director in my previous uh my previous life so um that was during the two years that we were on the security Council so all of these discussions are bringing back very live memories um I just I mean just to be very brief uh like when we were joining the council there's always a lot of discussion about the merits of elected members joining and we focused on a few aspects of that one is that if you believe in multilateralism the rules-based multilateral order you have to stand up and play a kind of an active role in it from time to time but also that there are a lot of issues on the council which are very complex and politically challenging and difficult for permanent members to to progress um so on those kind of issues and in our case it was um Ethiopia climate and security uh humanitarian exemptions for sanctions and so on these are all areas that we were able to make very practical progress and Syria humanitarian where we were the Copans on that as well but I spoke at a similar event to this in Riga um last year uh because Latvia is coming on the cat or they're astounding for election to the council very soon as well um and I noticed speaking to people there there was a lot of pushback um amongst the public and the media there about the idea of Latvia standing uh for the council so my question is um is there more that you think uh countries can do to highlight the value and the importance of of smaller countries especially going for seats on the council thanks do you want to start site yeah no thank you Ambassador first of all I think I mean commend you and Geraldine Ambassador Geraldine uh Bryn Mason because I I really Ireland did a quit itself extremely well in the two years that it was on the council and I think you know you make the point and I think it does bear underscoring that there are many countries or at least in the past you know before we the E10 challenged for the pen with the countries would be on and off the council and you really wouldn't know what they contributed Beyond reading statements and what substantively did they contribute and that's an era where the permanent five would agree on the text they put the text in front of you you didn't negotiate it with them and they say well either you abstain or you reject it but that's the text and in my seven months of being on the security Council became before I became human rights Chief you know there was only one discussion which was a genuine discussion on text 15 ambassadors discussing the drafting of text so the evolution I think has been has been rather dramatic as you will know it's not always the power of a state in terms of the size of its GDP the size of its defense budget it's often the caniness the skill of diplomats persons who so represent states that make the huge difference that's required and so Niels this you know spoke of Liechtenstein Ambassador Christian Vanessa who's been there for a long time he has a staff of maybe three you know and yet he can produce an enormous result you know and I think that's the point that a skilled representation I mean I'm an ex-diplomat I like to speak on behalf of diplomats practicing High art most publics think that diplomats are pampered they live in nice houses they do protocol work no one really defend in Parliament and I think we have once did we thought of doing a trade Union across the world of diplomats because we do practice a high art it's it's you know amazing to think 193 countries can agree on anything and anything and it's great skill that you get them to the point where they agree the problem actually we had the discussion over lunch is not the countries agreeing on an instrument it's actually the governments in taking those issues taking them back home and saying we have to now take on vested interests back home trade unions if they're trade unions or commercial interests or whatever it may be we have to take them on and that's where often the failure exists in terms of actually making treaties work making the global system work so I I think you're right in thinking that if you have a small country that has no territorial Ambitions that is just trying to be the play the Good Citizen and has skilled diplomats it can make a difference and a really positive difference especially also if it has good lawyers on it because so often you have fluid situation you need to understand the law very well and if you stick to the law you have a principled position and you'll be applauded for it so I I applaud Arnold's position really do you have a very brief comment thank you for a very good question and uh and uh yeah small countries like Ireland and Norway as well Ireland it can make a difference and uh I very much agree that the diplomacy is kind of an art and um it it really depends on um the diplomats if you if diplomacy should be successful it depends on the diplomats to taking out a low-key role uh and not not kind of shouting out it's it's uh results and and it's success so it's it's very delicate to get diplomacy to work and that means also that it's a difficult thing to sell back home so when Norway is part of the security Council for two years and they're doing diplomacy every year to to really get things to help help to do to get things to come together together with all the 15 member states and they get results and successes and failures but those are very difficult to sell to the newspapers back home because of the I think it's it kind of what is in the nature of diplomacy in a way and and that's just how it is but journalists and experts and researchers and people that are interested in this should could do whatever they they can to talk about the complexity and and the importance and the interesting part and and diplomacy that's going on and in this Arenas and just try try to to bring that out to the public that but I think so I'm going to take the lead here uh we are done I'm sorry we've run out of time but we are having another event on the similar topic on the 6th of March where we will have two practitioners coming directly from the UN in New York to tell us more about um their experiences representing two uh smaller elected members in the U.N security Council and furthering agendas such as cyber security climate uh women's peace and security so I hope some of you will show up for that as well and then I just want to finish by thanking our two excellent speakers Saeed and Nils and thank you for all of us for to all of you of course for joining us today thank you thank you thank you so much thank you
qG3VCpLtJSM,Law of the sea Internal Waters International Law United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,"Law of the sea: Internal Waters visualized, simplified and explained animated explainer video

#law #internationallaw #lawschool #legal 

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, is the main treaty governing the oceans, by balancing the coastal state's rights to regulate and exploit the sea under their jurisdiction, versus the freedom of the oceans.

The convention permits coastal States, to establish six different maritime zones as follows:
Internal waters
The territorial sea
The contiguous zone
The exclusive economic zone
The continental shelf
and The high seas

Internal waters, such as bays, lakes, and rivers, are national waters located landward from the baselines, from which the width of the territorial and other zones is calculated, and are assimilated with the sovereign territory of the state.

They are different from the territorial sea, in that there is no right of innocent passage for foreign vessels. As a result, a State is not obligated to allow foreign ships into its national water, particularly its ports, unless there is a distress situation, or a treaty that requires it.

Once a foreign vessel enters internal waters, it is subject to the domestic legislation of the coastal state, which has the authority to take enforcement action against negligent boats, and even prevent them from leaving port.

While the Port States generally do not enforce their criminal jurisdiction over crimes that do not violate their customs laws, or disrupt peace and public order, The exercise of port State jurisdiction is still common,  in respect of vessels that violate health and safety regulations, or pollute the environment outside the State territorial sea.

This concurrent jurisdiction may be seen in Wildenhus’ case, where The Supreme Court held that the American courts had jurisdiction to try a crew member of a Belgian vessel, for the murder of another Belgian national, when the ship was docked in the internal water of the port of Jersey City.

The British Court also decided in another case, that an American national was subject to English law, after committing manslaughter on board a British vessel in French internal waters, although he was within French justice's jurisdiction.

law of the sea convention",1,[Music] law of the sea internal waters visualized the united nations convention on the law of the sea is the main treaty governing the oceans by balancing the coastal states rights to regulate and exploit the sea under their jurisdiction versus the freedom of the oceans the convention permits coastal states to establish six different maritime zones as follows internal waters the territorial sea the contiguous zone the exclusive economic zone the continental shelf and the high seas internal waters such as bays lakes and rivers are national waters located landward from the baselines from which the width of the territorial and other zones is calculated and are assimilated with the sovereign territory of the state they are different from the territorial sea in that there is no right of innocent passage for foreign vessels as a result a state is not obligated to allow foreign ships into its national water particularly its ports unless there is a distress situation or a treaty that requires it once a foreign vessel enters internal waters it is subject to the domestic legislation of the coastal state which has the authority to take enforcement action against negligent boats and even prevent them from leaving port while the port states generally do not enforce their criminal jurisdiction over crimes that do not violate their customs laws or disrupt peace and public order the exercise of port state jurisdiction is still common in respect of vessels that violate health and safety regulations or pollute the environment outside the state territorial sea this concurrent jurisdiction may be seen in wild and whose case where the supreme court held that the american courts had jurisdiction to try a crew member of a belgian vessel for the murder of another belgian national when the ship was docked in the internal water of the port of jersey city the british court also decided in another case that an american national was subject to english law after committing manslaughter on board a british vessel in french internal waters although he was within the jurisdiction of france [Music]
7Zb3MdyTXuM,Climate (in)Action Amidst U.S.- China Tensions,"For much of 2022, the entire planet has been struggling to cope with extreme weather events, ranging from brutal heatwaves and severe droughts in some regions to record rainfall and catastrophic flooding in others. 

Despite this, in early August, Beijing suspended ongoing U.S.-China talks on climate change in response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. While some climate experts have argued that what matters most in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is for the United States and China to take action domestically, the suspension of talks represents a shift in the effort to shield the climate agenda from geopolitics and has implications for the ability of each country, and the world, to meet essential reduction targets. 

In conversation with Alex Wang on November 1, 2022, Michael Davidson and Joanna Lewis discuss the significance of the downturn in U.S.-China relations on multilateral climate action.

take a lot of money a lot of capital and Technology to help Global South countries and complete this low carbon transition and both China and the U.S as the largest r d Spenders uh the largest economies and huge sources of FDI are going to be crucial players in that [Music] my name is senior program officer at the National Committee in U.S China relations I am pleased to introduce our

and governance project key following a thread here is also a fellow of the national equities public intellectuals program Alex the floor is yours thanks so much Nita and thanks to the National Committee for organizing this conversation about U.S and China Dynamics and climate change it's a real pleasure to be talking with uh two old friends uh Michael and Joanna and who are among the leading experts on U.S China climate relations in the world and it's uh uh I'm really pleased to have this chance to talk with you all and hear what you think on these these topics uh so why don't we just Dive Right In I mean I think the the first question you know where uh the the so-called cop 27 the international climate negotiation meetings are coming up next uh next week in Egypt uh we all know that uh tensions between the US and China are at their highest the highs they've been in in recent decades uh we know that just in August in response to Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan Beijing suspended official bilateral talks on climate action and um so right now we we enter the cop in this General State of Affairs and so I guess the the first question I'd ask um and maybe uh ask Joanna to kick it off for us is to comment on what you think these dynamics mean for the cop and what it means for uh Chinese and American climate action yeah well I think it's you know important to remember um that it is I think in both China and the United States interests to engage on climate change you know both countries presidents want to be viewed as global leaders on this issue and and see this issue as a domestic priority so you know I think let me touch first on the importance of U.S China bilateral cooperation on climate change as pertains to the international climate negotiations and then and then bring it back to cop 27 specifically um you know it's important to remember right that we've seen engagement and coordination between China and the us as key to um to really important progress being made in the multilateral climate sphere right so of course we point to the Paris agreement in 2015 I think many of us believe that that apparent that agreement would not exist today if we had not had concerted bilateral effort between the US and China um you know really led by then secretary Kerry you know going back to 2013 and and really you know you could point to Decades of U.S China engagement but really you know elevated in 2013 with the U.S China climate change working group and the 2014 joint statement between the U.S and China where there are U.S you know where they're you where their ndcs were announced a year ahead of Paris I think that was really what led to you know the world um you know building momentum uh around these these targets which led to the eventual um adoption of the Paris agreement in in 2015 and and you know because the leadership of China and the US is the two largest emitters still you know and sort of the the figurehead leaders of the the so-called developed and developing world right just really important in the context of these negotiations so you know I think that and then we saw this again in Glasgow right just a year ago now um you know the Dynamics very different from where we are today but um we're just you know four in the final 48 Hours of the um the meeting we saw the surprise announcement of uh U.S China joint declaration um these back-to-back press conferences from secretary Kerry Minister Shia that again announced this new joint statement right and and then relaunched a U.S China working group and that's what got paused back in August yeah um before if I could interject with a question you know what what's your take I totally agree with you on the value the value of that cooperation pre-paris you know I I felt that the Glasgow cooperation was less it felt less important certainly because uh you know it just it didn't have the same impact I think as sort of the agreement leading into Paris it's a question from maybe both of you you know there is a debate about cooperation versus competition that we're going to sort of explore in this and I'm curious as to whether you think I would love your comments on the changing nature of cooperation do you do you think that that type of cooperation is less important or do you think it's as important as it ever was like the sort of joint announcements kind of showing that both the top emitters are on board with with uh with climate action well look I would just say that um you know the The Joint um declaration that was signed in Glasgow you know that was the first um the first time we'd had something like that since you know back during the Obama Administration right because the you know we essentially didn't have any um real U.S China engagement on climate during the Trump Administration so you were really you know essentially starting from scratch and and in a really different U.S China climate right U.S China climate is not the right word you know U.S China relationship you know a brand new set of of Economic and security tensions right which which we'll dive into so I think that um you know the type of cooperation we were seeing during the Obama Administration which were about technology cooperation things like the US China Clean Energy Research Center joint r d that is not that is not um happening in this current political climate for a variety of reasons where we're really looking at strategic competition Around clean energy technology cheese and so I think it was still important you know to have cooperation around things like methane emissions you know again things that were missing from China's NDC so still significant um but I agree with you it's a different type of cooperation uh still important still important you know to the momentum of the international negotiations so you know going into cop27 I do think it's it's problematic that you know the um the the lead negotiators you know the heads of the delegations have not been in the same communication that they were going into other big um other big cops you know but this is a lower Stakes cop then Glasgow than Paris you know there's not a big um a big Global agreement on the table there's not even a a leader statement on the table potentially this is really a cop with a different focus and so I I think you know hopefully um you know hopefully they won't sort of derail the focus of the negotiations which is really much on loss and damage developing country issues well I'd love to also ask uh both of you to what do you expect uh to see out of the US and China at the cause with you know in particular in relation to each other you've sort of already gestured a part of the exercise maybe just trying to show leadership right that might be one of the the goals you've also noted that maybe hard to get this kind of technical cooperation that has been put like for example from Glasgow out on the table one of the things that seems to be coming out in the media coverage of China is that China's been emphasizing common but differentiated responsibilities this notion that developed Nations uh have different responsibilities or more responsibilities than developing nations and they've made a call for a global clean energy partnership with all of the different kind of global South organizations uh you know asean uh bricks and and others and so they seem to be signaling but you know maybe in the face of all of this kind of U.S talk about competition that they're trying to show or up their alliances so I'm curious as to what you know do you have any thoughts on that or or other dynamics that you see might be part of the U.S or Chinese strategy as they head into top 27. yeah I think that the I mean certainly the cooperation Dynamics are have changed remarkably since the Obama Administration but also the need for cooperation has shifted um I think prior to Paris there was a lot of uncertainty that we could get a consensus unanimous internationally agreed uh uh commitment like the Paris agreement on the books that would push countries to make these commitments and then come back each year and on a regular schedule to update them uh the need for cooperation between U.S China shifted dramatically since then now what I see is that we need to push both countries to stop getting in each other's ways of reducing emissions putting up barriers and other policies that would make it harder to do the clean energy transition in both countries and in other countries and notably Alex you mentioned these Global South Partnerships um if U.S China intentions um get much worse and you start to see even uh higher costs and more difficulties with Supply chains and more tensions um U.S consumers are going to feel the pinch but more likely in these other countries that are facing a really a very visceral Choice based on affordability concerns about what energy choices to choose from that's going to be most concerning so I I mean I see any kind of Partnerships that U.S and China want to make with with other developing countries to try to help them on the low carbon transition as a boon for the climate I would like to see a little bit less of a zero-sum competition between us and China on securing those Partnerships I think there is still space to work together on these despite the way the way the current tensions are but nevertheless we know that it's going to take a lot of money a lot of capital and Technology to help Global South countries and complete this low carbon transition and both China and the U.S as the largest r d Spenders the largest economies and huge sources of FDI are going to be crucial players in that I mean I just think it's it's really amazing if you think back to where we were a year ago versus where we are now and just how the world has changed on this issue I mean you know remember back in Fall of 2021 when President XI had made this announcement at unga about how China was going to stop financing um whole plants abroad right and this really everyone was very excited about this and there were all these commitments being made in the G7 and elsewhere about how everyone was going to stop building coal and and really you know going into cop uh 26 there was just all this momentum about the phase down of fossil fuels and moving away from coal right and now here we are a year later with the Russia Ukraine conflict and everyone is scrambling for more fossil fuels you know and you're seeing just this backsliding right on a lot of the commitments that were made across Europe um you're seeing you know Germany really I think you know really trying to get out of a lot of the commitments that were made and and you know you see the developing world looking at this right and and this is going to come out I think very strongly a cop 27 um which is on the African continent right and there's just going to be this focus on uh what is going on you know um why are we sort of pulling back on a lot of these commitments what is the role right of the of a lot of these financing pledges and you know and I think this is just really about um you know how the commitments that have been made you know what did they mean you know how can we make sure that there's going to be follow through right and then of course China is the center of a lot of this that's such a great point and I think you know we are my the the sense that you're getting these days is also just the climate impacts are so much more on the Forefront of everyone's mind right it's in the headlines every day I think media coverage has really started to change and and report I think in a more substantial and better way about just the the climate impacts that we're facing every day and so that's the context with within which this uh discussion will be uh happening now on this um I want to come back to a point that Michael was making you know you're essentially gesturing at this possibility of sort of in this competition doing harm to our ability to pursue climate actions so maybe I want to ask a question to both of you about you know clearly this notion of competition is out there and has become Central to the Biden administration's uh China strategy right that they've put out this notion that the pithy phrasing of it I believe is invest and align and compete I said just you know invest at home Ally with with people and then compete on that basis um so what what do you all think about the prospects of that actually driving uh positive change in the sort of Space Race analogy versus going south in a way that does more harm than than good right you know arguably inflation reduction Act is a really positive sign you know in the invest category from from the United States right when it's a big move and we're all excited see how that that plays out but um you know you know we've all sort of been thinking about this issue of how can accelerate in a positive direction versus go in a in a negative slow down Direction and curious as your thoughts on on this this dynamic you know I'll I'll take a take a stab at it I think there's of course elements uh positive elements and negative elements in the new framing right um we know that the cost of clean energy have come down quite a bit due to very stiff Global competition and they need to go down even further and competition is going to help with that we know that we need a lot of technologies that we don't have commercially available today that's not going to come just from governments making um r d Investments it's going to come from private sector it's motivated by competition competitive firms accessing capital resources globally so we know that we need all of those elements the challenge is that if you take a competitive stance and you insist on a more National competitiveness angle then you might put up barriers to enable the lowest cost technology and the best Innovations to diffuse and we do see elements of those as well where you have an increasing turn towards protectionism which would make the whole process of deploying developing and deploying low carbon technologies that that much harder not just for us and China but for the rest of the world yeah and you know we we the three of us uh were recent co-authors on a piece that came out in science policy form kind of get in part getting at this issue of the risks of uh decoupling uh I don't know if either if you want to comment a little bit more about you know the tagline on that was you know the met you know sometimes the the medicine is worse than the The Cure is worse than the disease I think uh so I don't know if you guys want to talk about that you know the paper basically unpacks economic and and security risks associated with decoupling or integration foreign yeah I mean we were motivated by the policy debates that are occurring um in the U.S and Europe and elsewhere around decoupling from China that really lack specificity and an objective assessment of the risks and benefits of of that policy Direction and so our methodology was we selected five Technologies emerging and mature uh we went through uh we focused on economic and National Security risks as you mentioned uh we tried to score across each of the Technologies these different metrics uh went down to the component level and then we aggregated those up to each technology and we came up with some subjective assessments and our kind of broad take broad um conclusions are that economic risks are much more heterogeneous than National Security risks as some economic risks include the risk of supply chain disruptions and for those policy recourse strategy might be a selective process of diversification on the other hand National Security risks are much more hormone genius and seem to be quite muted across these Technologies which seem to indicate that we should be focusing Less on using or justifying using National Security angles the the decoupling agenda particularly low carbon technology from China um I mean we also conclude and this is based on you know work by Joanna and others that government facilitation is desirable to pursue joint demonstrations for new technologies and that there's a need for diversification and different technology Pathways that both us and China again as the world's two largest r d uh superpowers in clean energy and in many other areas need to take the lead on and so yeah John John I don't know if you wanted to comment on on that well I was just gonna say I mean I I think that this is you know we've seen this real shift in how Washington is thinking about climate policy right where um you know when I came here um almost 20 years ago now right we were really thinking about market-based responses right how we can get a cap and trade Bill through Congress and all this right and we really shifted to an industrial policy strategy right and when you look at the IRA it's it's an agree it's a green industrial policy it's really about um you know thinking about how we can build clean energy Industries here at home and and there's nothing wrong with that right but we really need to be I think you know we need to be frank about the trade-offs about doing that and what you know how that could actually slow down our ability to deploy low carbon Technologies at scale not just here in in the United States but globally you know particularly in the developing world because when you look at Global Climate targets when you look at where you know Clean Energy Technologies need to be deployed you know to meet uh 1.5 degree goals right but by um the end of the century it's it's mostly in the developing World these are places that are you know where you need these Technologies to be as inexpensive as possible right and and Michael very nicely documented did with with some colleagues in a in a recent nature paper you know the role that China others have played and just driving down the costs of of solar and other Technologies right to make them more affordable um for for the world right in solving the climate crisis so when you start to decouple from China which is now you know like it or not um just has the dominant uh is just dominant in these clean energy Supply chains right it is just dominant in batteries dominant in Wind dominant and solar we have to be just very clear about the cost repercussions of that right and the security issues are as we evaluate in the science paper are relatively minimal often managed right and so it's just it's it's just not a sort of one-size-fits-all solution and and so we're just sort of asking for a nuanced approach and a strategic approach to sort of how we handle this and being um just being you know conscious of sort of what are the climate trade-offs versus the sort of Economic and security trade yeah that's a great way to frame it I think to think that there are climate trade-offs for this move which is already beginning right so America is is engaging in industrial policy and the hope is either to reassure manufacturing or to so-called French or I get it into uh friendly countries and and one question is is that realistic right I'm curious as to where you all stand right now and you know part of the answer may just be it's hard to know we need to do a lot more research we probably need more investment in these types of things but I'm curious as to where you all stand on that because it's it's not it's not obvious that this will succeed right if there's real there's plenty of risk in in this endeavor right I mean I'm doing some research on this topic now right and and I mean it's it's difficult and when you look at you know the the non-china countries that are involved in these Supply chains um and first of all a lot of the the non-chinese countries are actually chinese-owned uh facilities right who have for the most part due to trade restrictions sort of built um and elsewhere right so they're technically still Chinese um but you you basically see if if your goal is to sort of diversify to um you know friendlier markets you're basically you know there's a handful of countries that are well positioned it's primarily in East Asia Japan South Korea um you know if your goal is to sort of you know try to help other developing countries sort of build capacity uh you know that is a that is a difficult thing you know in in countries where you don't necessarily have the um the capacity to kind of build up these industries and you find that like in particularly in Africa South America the main parts of the supply chain that are there are the extractive industries it's the mining you know of rare Earths for example um which are you know these are dirty extractive Industries um and that's sort of the only thing you see see kind of you know outside of China and there's other issues right with sort of building up those Industries in these parts of the world and and these are often not necessarily things like the US wants to reassure right they're looking more for the kind of the higher value added um refining you know sort of parts of the industry so I think it's complex um and I think you know and honestly like in in the research we're doing to kind of um characterize where the the non-china supply chains are and you know what this would look like like the data is not great right it's um and so we're I think it I think this has to be carefully thought through right and the environmental law area you know there's a lot of discussion kind of bubbling up now about you know permitting issues you know how how do you speed up deployment while still being true to the environmental guard rails and all and conflicts between different environmental issues so this is going to be a really contested area yeah very important yes uh I know Michael do you have a comment I'd love to hear your thoughts on that just basically point on on this you know the basic Endeavor to kind of resource you know what where where are you now on the the risks and the likelihood of a success in that area thank you yeah I think one of the I think contributions of um our science paper is really to distinguish between a domestic only onshore strategy which is sometimes seen as being the only response to concentration in China and a diversification strategy diversification doesn't mean we bring it all home it means that we have some diversification across multiple countries in case of supply chain disruptions for example which can occur due to natural disasters as much as Government intervention or threats of trade involvements or something like that or a pandemic right the pandemic of course is pandemic it's Global but it you know it can have localized impacts but you know more specific natural disasters like you know the Fukushima tsunami and the impacts that had on Japan Supply chains you know those kinds of things of course Merit some consideration that's a diversification that calls for diversification and there's a higher bar if we want to have fully domestic onshore for the reason to mitigate those risks um but I will say the inflation reduction accidents were kind of talking about this quite a bit which is passed over the Summers the first major piece of climate legislation you know ever by some counts compared to the last big legislation The Recovery Act this is a huge increase you know up from roughly 90 billion in The Recovery Act which is passed after the 2008 financial crisis up to 370 billion in climate and environmental Investments and then an explicit climate Focus this is overwhelmingly good and includes many industrial policy elements that Joanna talked about so specifically predictable long-term credits for renewable energy as well as other newer Technologies our carbon capture it has manufacturing subsidies these are all elements that contributed to China's success in its own clean Tech Supply chains for example as well as consumer facing rebates and many other elements that are all very good now but they do present some challenges for U.S China relations one is that they don't do anything with the existing or prospective trade remedies that are in place that are currently making Technologies importing the U.S more expensive making it more expensive for U.S consumers to deploy those Technologies and likely making slowing down learning processes as we talked about in a separate paper and you know nothing encapsulates this point more than this a huge kerfuffle that we had in May where the Department of Commerce was considering it took a trade case it was considering slapping tariffs of up to 200 percent or more on imported panels not from China but from other countries southeast Asia like Joanna mentioned that basically ground the entire solar industry to a halt you had 70 gigawatts of deployment at risk hundred thousand jobs according to solar energy industry Association that were at risk because of how far some of these trade remedies could be taken and you know legitimate reasons on their part that the administration might actually go that far now the the vitamin search had to step in to say no wait a minute we're not going to put those enormous tariffs on it and they put a two-year pause on it and that was enough to kind of quiet down the industry and get things rolling again but that was that was a Band-Aid fix for a much more systemic problem and I think this kind of this challenge of how do you know how do we and to what extent do we onshore all of the cleantech manufacturing supply chain is with us for some time and so my kind of short response to that Alex is I don't think it's realistic to have a completely onshore keep it seal it off within our borders uh domestic supply chain for all the things that we're going to need to combat climate change I do think there is an important role for U.S manufacturing and for other U.S parts of the value chain as we see in other Technologies like wind where Joanna has done a lot of work on um but I think it's really important for us to think about a what kinds of policies can we do to support the manufacturing employment and support the other policy objectives that we have while also not stomping on Global Supply chains and Global Learning which has got us to the point now where we can actually Envision and uh visualize a hundred percent Clean Energy System right um I want to shift gears to the question of how China is doing on meeting its own climate goals so um as I think most people will know China has a 2060 carbon neutrality going to go to Peak uh before 2030 uh P commissions by before 2030 and so I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are on how that's going these days right we've heard a lot about the the Chinese construction of coal-fired power plants even as they're building on a lot of clean tech and then I want to ask you for a specific if you were to be able to implement right now one major policy change to help this uh movement on climate action along what would you pick so the broadly is what is China doing on climate recently and and what are the challenges that it's facing well the similar challenges that are faced by other countries is energy security right that's top of Mind in for China's planners European planners American planners everybody um and that's recognizing that energy systems serve multiple policy objectives and climate environments are come along a little late to this but energy security and affordability are always top of mind um and so China had this very massive power outage in 2021 and had some more localized power outages again in 2022 and those are driven and in part by this volatility with global fossil fuel markets but also driven by incomplete reforms in China to its power system and power markets and the much more focused uh response to that has reached the highest levels where we saw president Xi Jinping and outgoing Premier League talk about this issue energy security much more prominent than what you saw before um unfortunately they're also taking some of the wrong lessons where they're doubling down on Coal Power deployment in certain areas thinking that this was because there wasn't enough Coal Power capacity to provide demand which is not the case um China actually has a very diverse set of renewable energy resources geographically and has the Envy of the world the world's largest ultra high voltage transmission Network where it can transmit that power across large distances so when the sun is shining out west the you know folks in the East can take advantage of it Etc so I think China's lessons and what I would sort of recommend to help address these energy security currents while also staying in the low carbon path is to diversify more to diversify across renewable and nuclear energy sources which are uh much less susceptible to Global volatility and fossil fuel markets and to double down on reforms of power markets and transmission operation that can allow that energy to get to to Market an efficient cost effective way right yeah I was I was I'm glad you threw in a wonkier grid reform recommendation I was almost afraid you weren't going to bring that in so uh Joanna what do you think yeah I do I knew he would which is why I wanted him to go first I mean I I think that you know Michael and others have just done really important work on you know pointing out that the challenges to um China's you know decarbonization are at this point they're really not technical they're it's really the political economy of China's power sector transition right now that are really holding up a lot of what should be happening there I mean when you see these just really um distorted incentives behind building new coal plants right it I mean it and again Yes Energy security right but it's not a short it's not a real shortage right in that it's not a supply demand imbalance it is but it's it's an artificial one right and it's due to these bottlenecks in the grid and the way that the grid is structured and the way that power is moved around the country and the way that these markets are set up that they're not real markets and who has control right over these things and the way things are priced and and again a lot of it is just the fact that you are just sort of trying to operate um you're trying to sort of introduce Market signals and what is primarily so operating as a non-market economy um with very powerful interests right um primarily state-owned Enterprises and primarily the coal industry and and the the large power companies and so you just have this this issue where you you do have you know increasingly large amounts of clean energy um that is still it's being integrated in the grin at much larger amounts than it used to be you know we do see decreasing curtailment numbers but you just have these um real inefficiencies in um the way coal plants are being operated you know which is very low capacity factors and you just have this just really inefficiency in the way power is still being um Priced Right and and just being um operated in the grid even though you have this super high tech as Michael mentioned you know ultra high voltage transmission and you they're just sort of no technical basis for a lot of these I think are really just political Innovations that's a great point and I think you see these uh political skirmishes being fought in so many different areas right like for example I I recently were spent a year working with Chinese Partners on uh the missions trading system yes and you know for those who don't follow this you know in in essence the system turns out to be you know it's it's a system that subsidizes more efficient coal-fired power plants and taxes less efficient coal-fired power plants and there's ways that you know lots of people are proposing different ways that you can make make it more uh create more dramatic incentives for example for clean energy like you could build it in so that if you build more clean energy you would benefit from the subsidies of the system but you know just the way the politics of that is played out yeah really turned into a way to kind of edge the cold cold Fleet in a more efficient Direction rather than something more dramatic and again and you know this this the that system was originally designed to cover eight sectors right including the heavy industrial sectors which are still the vast majority of China's energy consumption right but they're they're not yet right part of that it's it's still um starting with the power sector right so there's you know again a lot of what China has to do on emissions is still about um about in the you know it's about heavy industry and they get a lot of this is responding to economic stimulus measures and and what's happening kind of in the the zero covet you know sort of what's happening there so yeah absolutely well um I think we're about at times so it's it's uh always great to hear your thoughts on on everything and thanks again to the National Committee for uh having us here to discuss these important issues and uh hand it back to Nita thank you all so much for sharing your thoughts and insights with us today I'd also like to thank my colleagues the National Committee staff members behind the scenes who helped me make today's interview possible we hope that those who have tuned in today found the interview both interesting and informative and that you will join us for future National Committee programming down the road thank you all again and have a great day
qG9S4E7ifWY,Eyes on Ukraine Part III: The One-Year Anniversary of Russia’s Invasion,"In the year since Russia invaded Ukraine, U.S.-China relations have continued to deteriorate; one factor is Beijing’s continued support of Moscow’s position and rhetoric.

in Ukraine could be viewed and has been viewed as a model or a template or at least a comparable case for a Chinese Invasion where the Chinese will call the uh the unification effort of of Taiwan but it's almost entirely a model or a template of what now to do [Music] my name is Jessica Bissett and I'm the director of leadership programs at the National Committee on U.S China relations last year we spoke twice with sunyan director of the China program at the Stimson Center for interview series eyes on Ukraine strategic implications for China Russia and the United States once before Russia's February 24th invasion of Ukraine and then once again on March 7th a couple of weeks later as we approach the one-year anniversary of the invasion Yoon has agreed to join us for a third installment in this series Yoon as always thank you so much for taking the time to help us better understand what has transpired over the past 12 months and what the future may hold we have a lot to cover so let's Jump Right In so one year into this deadly conflict what does the view from China look like do you have a sense about the general mood amongst the Chinese public and does the public sentiment track with the official line as China's narrative about the war evolved at all uh thank you Jessica thank you for having me and thank you for the great questions um I think for for China one year into this this war between Russia and Ukraine China more than ever wants this war to be over and this desire has been expressed by different levels of the Chinese leadership as well as Chinese officials and I think that position does reflect where China is the question is what will China have to do to bring the war to an end right it's always easy to call for peace and call for the two sides to settle but unfortunately that is not a political reality that we're currently looking at so I think as for example um Wang e is currently in Europe and doing his diplomatic maneuver um I think the key question is that what is China willing to do in terms of the uh the solution or in terms of a settlement of the of the War in China I think the official narrative about the war has evolved quite a bit and I'm sure people can recall about a year ago when the war first broke out the Chinese was very they were very defensive about Russia they were almost entirely blaming NATO for his expansion and for Ukraine for inviting NATO expansion for triggering the Russian uh responsible triggering the Russian invasion of Ukraine uh that line we don't see as much in China today in China's official narrative this reference to Nato being responsible for the War I mean if you ask the Chinese officials it will still go there but this is not the top position or the Top Line they're trying to they're trying to strike well the Chinese General Public I think there is still a sense of Illusion that somehow Russia is not going to lose so somehow Russia is is still doing okay with uh with the war and you see this from the um from the from the Chinese for example the discussions online about how Russia was faking as failure and in fact Russia has been planning this big pushback and it will be a decisive and Swift military Victory are being repeated on the on the Chinese um among the Chinese netizens which forms a sharp contrast to how the Russia experts in China views the war because they see that there's no doubt Russia is losing and Russia is not going to see a chance of achieving the goal it has set out to achieve a year ago and in Russia no matter what happens to the end of this war Russia is going to end up as a weaker power so I think this distinction between the Chinese General Public and Chinese expert Community is also is also very interesting it is interesting that's that's quite a distinction um economics and trade according to a recent Wall Street Journal article despite International sanctions and Export controls Chinese state-owned defense companies are shipping navigation equipment jamming Technologies and jet fighter Parts the sanctioned Russian government-owned defense companies what do you think is the impact of continuing Chinese shipments to Russia after a year of war is this something that was to be expected and will it continue do you think these shipments speak to a larger issue of the effectiveness of Shanks of sanctions against Russia help us unpack the china-russia economic relationship a bit more well it seems the Wall Street Journal article cover the really uh interesting aspects that people have been asking what kind of military support that China has been providing Russia and because of the lack of data and because of both the Chinese and Russians were not really transparent coming to their Customs data I think we were not able to answer this question but I think the recent uh Wall Street Journal article was able to provide some shared sunlight on this and I think they coded extensively the report from a investigative here in Washington um I think on this issue what I I like to emphasize is that any discussion about quality without the discussion of quantity is going to be uh it's going to be selective it's only going to reflect the part of the truth because if you look at the end of what the Chinese have provided based on these these reports the list of what China has provided to Russia it looks very long and very impressive but then if you look at the quantity the quantity in terms of that other trade and in terms of this shipment I would say that for normal arms trade or normal tax trade between China and Russia the quantity is fairly small so it suggests two things to me the first one is that this is not a large-scale evasion of the western sanction or the U.S sanction but instead I think this is more reflection of sporadic cases of individual Chinese companies doing this to to help Russia or to Simply export what Russia is in their need for and they're eager to make a profit and the other um takeaways that I have from this is that I find it very difficult to to draw the linkage between these shipment or this trade with a government-sanctioned approach or government the sanctioned order for this to happen because the scale is very small and I guess you could say that well even if it is smallest you could be sanctioned by the central government which is which is possible but I think that brings us to the question that what is a critical impact of these limited quantity of of equipments or technology or even semiconductor chips in this case I think one of the data if I recall correctly uh one of the data points going into China was exporting 13 million dollars worth of Jones to Russia and if you think about it was 30 million dollars that's quite a lot but then you can think about the price of the Chinese drones is at least one million dollars each right so which means that while limited well something like a dozen Jones is that really going to change the change anything on on the battlefield so of course if you look at it as a black or white matter did China send these equipments to Russia yes it did but if the question is did the Chinese equipment play a critical role in uh on the battlefield then well Russia still has been has been losing so I think this this data and these uh these facts needs to be interpreted from uh from several different different directions that's a really good point the quantity and quality Dynamic um can you talk a little bit just to follow up about economics and trade can you talk about the role of um China continuing to buy Russian oil and natural gas is that helping to kind of continue to feed the the Russia's war machine I guess is that playing a dominant role in kind of keeping Russia afloat during this time uh the simple answer is yes right because that's Revenue creation that creates the the foreign exchange that Russia uses to continue its effort well not only in the battlefield but also continue is uh is is National economy so basically um but if you look at the impact of the um again the impact of this Revenue creation on the war well the simple fact is that Russia is still losing so how much has this Revenue creation really helped Russia to win this War I think that's a separate question and we'll have a different we'll have a different answer and if we look at for example the Chinese import of the Russian oil uh I think one thing that people don't pay as much attention to is that yes the value of the Chinese oil import from Russia increased very significantly last year in fact if we look at Ballad or trade the bad ladder trade between China and Russia increased almost 30 percent in the year of 2022 and looking at the value of crude oil import from Russia alone it increased by 44 so almost increased by by half of of the value in 2021 but then again other than the value you also look at the volume the volume of the Chinese oil import from Iran I'm sorry from Russia only increased eight percent so what does that mean that means that the crude oil exports that Russia sold to China was much more expensive in 2022 compared to 2021 and that's because of the effect of the wars the job of the International Energy prize so and between China and Russia the surprise of their uh of their oil trade has a complicated formula based on several different prices so it's a flat Choice it's not a fixed price when the international oil price goes up the price that China has to pay to Russia to buy oil also goes up which is why is that you look at the value wow it increased by 44 and then you look at the volume it only increased by eight percent that's a really helpful distinction thanks thank you for unpacking that a bit more I wanted to move on to some of the Ukraine Taiwan parallels that we've all heard about over the past year um in our interview last March you noted that Russia's war in Ukraine could be viewed as a model or template for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan in the future how has the war evolved as a reference point for China and what lessons has China taken away from this oh the Chinese Takeaway on this has uh has has become has been so rich right throughout the past year and yes I still think that the Russian war in Ukraine could be viewed and has been viewed as a model or a template or at least a comparable case for a Chinese Invasion or what the Chinese will call the uh the unification effort of of Taiwan but it's almost entirely a model or a template of what not to do because the Russia Fiasco on a battlefield has translated into a very sobering message to the Chinese officials to Chinese government and especially the Chinese military that you can think that you prepared for a war really well but when the war actually starts it may go into directions that you never thought it would and if you think about the Russian war in Ukraine before it um before it broke out or when the right after it broke out the whole world thought Russia was going to Prevail in a week right and nobody saw that Ukraine was able to last for this long but one year later the battlefield situation has shown us and has told the world that well we were wrong in our original estimate so I think that is the first and most important takeaway for China that a Invasion plan of Taiwan will have to take into consideration of all possibilities and the things may not go as smoothly or swiftly at the Chinese like no matter how they think they will be successful and the second takeaway I think for China is a prohibitive cost associated with such a war when the Chinese look at Russia yes Russia is still able to sell their energy resources and it seems to have generated Revenue uh for the year of 2022 but if you when the Chinese look at the financial economic trade technological let alone military political and diplomatic costs that Russia has to pay for this war that is not even winning I think the takeaway for China is that even if we are successful in taking over Taiwan militarily we still have to consider whether these costs are going to be worth it because remember for the Chinese unification is regarded as a component a necessary component of national Rejuvenation the Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation right but at the same time if the cost of the unification is precisely China's Rejuvenation of the great Chinese Nation then it's not going to work the equation no longer no longer flies in the in the Chinese logic so I think all in all the Chinese Takeaway from the Russian war Ukraine is that we need to be more careful we need to be more cautious and we need to be prepared that one we may not win this war at this point and two even if we win this war the cost will be so high that it may not be worth out well all very interesting Dynamics to think about I wanted to take a bit of a step back and look at International power dynamics um we kind of explored this in our in our last interview and you were uncertain as to how things might um might show themselves as the war kind of was at a starting point at this time it's really interesting um you know the the war has simultaneously brought the United States and its European Democratic allies closer together but it's also highlighted some interesting fault lines and some shifts interestingly countries south such as South Africa India and Indonesia haven't gotten on board with the West could you talk a little bit more about this and some of your thoughts on the international power dynamics yeah this is a really complex question and if you look at the Chinese narrative and how the Chinese policy wonks impact this issue there are at least several different layers right so first offer if you look at the U.N for example the U.N voting and look at the international opinion about this war like you said brics countries South Africa Brazil um India and China they are not necessarily in the same position as the Western countries in terms of their strong criticism or condemnation of the of the war so I think the Chinese will even argue that if you look at the broad scope of all the countries in the world uh the West is still in the absolute minority coming to their their position about about this war but then coming more specifically to China's relationship with the West I think that's where it gets even more interesting because the Chinese diplomatic position or their priority clearly has been um well not to abandon Russia but at the same time also try to repair and mandate with Western countries especially European countries to make sure that China still has a relatively healthy relationship with them and can retain access to for example high-tech products that U.S that is no longer available from the from the United States so I think in terms of the international power dynamics the war in Ukraine is seen as an as an event that has created a major uncertainty for China's future but it also you know the Chinese logic whenever there's a crisis it also means opportunity so I think they are also seeing that a desired end game for China or desired position for China is to put China in a relatively neutral position that all sides or both sides Russia and the West both want China support both One China to Stage the support of their position so that will put China in a in a in a um basically in an invincible position that each side if each side all needs China's support and needs China to be on their side then China has the option and China has elaborated right but the danger of that of that strategy is uh well if your strategian between these two irreconcilable positions you could uh you could anger everybody and I think at some point uh towards the the end of last year um China was in that position because Russia has been very disappointed with the Chinese lack of unlimited support to Russia during the war but at the same time as in European countries were also extremely frustrated with China not taking a righteous or adjusted position or even an objective position on the on the war so I think a lot of the Diplomatic charm offensive including XI jinping's commitment uh position during his meeting with German Chancellor shows in Beijing that nuclear weapons should not be used in any circumstances it's an effort to repair this uh this this relationship so it's a dedicated balance and China is trying to manage uh but it's still a delicate and precarious position speaking of Europe and Germany Chinese China's top Diplomat wangi has been in Moscow this week on his way to the Munich security conference Paving the way for potential pres visit of President XI to Russia later this year what do you anticipate coming out of these meetings and what should observers be looking for as we aim to filter the signal from the noise oh I think that's a fascinating question because like you said wangi's trip and Wang is about diplomatic engagements in Europe is clearly Paving the ground for something and that's something as a lot of Chinese policy wanks are have been speculating is indeed a visit of presidency to Russia and you have to imagine what kind of detrimental effect that visit will have in terms of China's relationship with the United States and China's relationship was uh with Europe because it basically will prove Everything That Wall Street Journal and all these Western observers and Western media have been saying about China being the supporter or even the accomplice of Russia in the war in Ukraine is true so I think for China how to manage the consequences or to do damage control of this trip is really the top priority because that will determine pretty much how much the um the Improvement between Washington and Beijing can transpire if Beijing does not strike the right message if Beijing comes out of the visit looking like what China is indeed being the accomplice of Russia I think a lot of the prospect or the hope for improvement of relations with the west by the way which is the priority of Chinese foreign policy in 2023 after the the 25 of the 20th party Congress last year a lot of this hope will will be in vain and they will not uh they will not transpire so I I can understand why the Diplomatic groundwork is being is being paved but it's still going to be a very tricky position to take one thing that I suspect the Chinese will do like uh I think the uh Wang e earlier today or yesterday in his meeting was the Italian foreign minister he mentioned that Xi Jinping is going to make a statement to call for peace on the one year anniversary of the uh of the of the Ukraine war and I think that potentially is something that the Chinese will test to do which is you probably remember in Spring last year China has indicated implied that it could mediate but it never did anything for the whole course of the uh the past year but now I think China could indicate to Europe that well we have channels of communication open with Moscow and we also have some influence with Moscow so instead of seeing us as the accomplice of Russia maybe you can see us as a helpful dialogue partner so we can help to communicate facilitate Communications past messages and let's talk about the end of the war we'll be very curious to see if that announcement comes I wanted to I wanted to turn a little bit uh more specifically to U.S China relations um with balloon Gates taking U.S China relations to a new low how much does China's support of Russia continue to affect the bilateral dynamic I think it is quite significant if if not the most significant in terms of the bilateral relations we know that for all the meetings that the two uh the working level officials have had since the Bali Summit between XI and Biden last year a lot of the a lot of the conversation has focused on the Russian war in Ukraine and how to how to how to proceed from where we from where we are so I I do think that U.S China relations at least in terms of the substance uh is being significantly impacted by the uh by China's relationship with with Russia which I think the Chinese understand which is why I think the Chinese are sending wangi to Europe and painting the ground for something that uh that at least in the Chinese view seems seems to be inevitable but my question to Chinese interlocutors has been why does this trip have to happen now well why does this trip have to happen at the time when China is trying uh everything it can to improve relationship with relations with with the West both United States and Europe do we really consider this the best timing and the answers that I get is that well you know there's pressure from Russia and there's also the Optics of China's independent foreign policy so it seems that there is a perception of absolute necessity within the Chinese leadership that this trip has to happen but my recommendation or my my advice to them is that well maybe the trip that has to happen but maybe you can reschedule it to to a later date but then of course that's also a tricky question Xi Jinping is trying to meet with uh well at least for the for the Chinese foreign policy operators they're trying to craft a meeting between Xi Jinping and Biden again in September during the G27 in New Delhi and there's also the hope that she didn't hopefully can come to the ape ex Summit in San Francisco in November this year so that pretty much pushes the uh the the schedule to the end of the year so I understand that there is a trickiness coming to the schedule but the funny thing is that uh in January and in early February I think the U.S China the foreign policy the community policy Community work on U.S federal relations in both countries were discussing how about McCarthy's trip to Taiwan what kind of damage that is going to do to the trend of improvement not bad at the relations between the two countries but now it seems that the McCarthy's trip is being postponed to either later this year or next year but the XI jinping's trip to Moscow is emerging as a much bigger stressor for the bilateral relations in the months to come you know timing truly is everything and it's becoming more and more clear these days um looking ahead how do you think China will navigate its evolving ties with Russia what limits might China place on its willingness to be a military and economic Lifeline especially if U.S China relations continue to deteriorate while we hope that the relationship between us and China will not continue to deteriorate because after the past six years um we're being out all of us have been very traumatized and we're hoping that please blessings be better this year um so so but on the other hand that I um in terms of the China Buffet relations we have seen that the economic ties between the two countries are growing right which means that by the end of this war Russia is going to be primarily a economic partner of China and people wonder that what security significance or political significance Russia still carries and that's a question that needs to be deliberated because um my sense is that what China has gained the most from this war is a this illusionment about Russia being the power that China started was but Russia actually is not and I feel that this illusionment is going to reflect in China's relationship with Russia down the road and look at Russia's weakened uh comprehensive National Power and its power status it would be always also curious to see that to what extent Russia is willing to tolerate his own Junior partner status in this in this binary relations down the road but if I think that also says that it will give China more leverage in this bilateral relations it also will give China more ability to determine what it is willing and what it is not willing to do with Russia so yes enhance the ties between China and Russia is always going to be a problem I think from the U.S perspective especially coming to for example there it's a joint patrol of the Strategic bombers in Northeast Asia and they're joined Naval exercises in the in the Black Sea or now after the coast of the uh now jointly with South Africa so this type of strategic alignment between China and Russia is always going to be seen as a problem for for the United States but um we're also looking at how this relationship will be undermined because of the result of the war in Ukraine so that is due uh that is still evolving oh great you and I think we're we're running out of time even though I'm sure we could keep analyzing this situation I I leave you um the floor for any last thoughts or any wrap-up comments um we know you've been watching this closely so I guess um are there any questions that you wish you had the answer to ah yes so for example I wish I had I I wish I could find the answer to the question that what is going to happen to Russia's and sales to both China and India right so one could argue that while China and Russia China and India have had this border standoff and this this tension along is disputed a longer disputed border and India has still relied on Russia for the delivery of their weapon system 70 of the the weapon system used by the Indian military comes from the Russian sources so is this going to have an impact over how Russia will or will not continue their defense commitment or their arms delivery to to India I think that's one curious question another curious question is between China and Russia we know that arms trade mostly the Chinese purchase of advanced systems from Russia as being a key component in their in their security cooperation right but now with the result of the Ukraine war um I wonder whether the Chinese still have the same level of confidence about the Russian weapon system and whether Russia will continue to have the ability to produce reduce the weapon system that the Chinese are willing to buy and of course then there's also other questions about well how about China's role in the Arctic now Russia is in a weakened status um in the bilateral relations will it still be able to to tell China no when it is uncomfortable with China's aggressive approach or with China's ambitious approach in the in the Arctic and there's also the China Russia competition in for example the Civil nuclear reactor as a power power industry globally Russia has been a dominant player in that in that field and presumably for the Civil future Russia will need this Revenue more than ever but that's also a few that the Chinese are very eager to dive into and to carve out a piece for yourself so there are all these competitive aspects and potentially collaborative aspect between the between the two countries and we don't know the answers just yet thanks so much Yoon for once again sharing your expertise and Analysis with us today and many thanks to my National Committee colleagues behind the scenes for helping to craft today's questions and make this interview happen we hope you found the interview to be interesting and informative and that you will join us for future National Pro National Committee programming in the future thanks again and goodbye

Raisina Dialogue Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/raisinaofficial",1,a very good afternoon to All of You Justin Sameer minister colleagues and Friends uh it's really a pleasure to be with you this afternoon and uh I think as Justin pointed out uh this is an occasion for the rezina dialogue to Step Beyond the shores of India and in the room today I mean there could be a few others but I think Sameer and I could claim to be present at the Inception of razina dialogue it's a little bit like watching your kid go out of the country and you know you you have a interest you have a sense of Pride and really thank you very much for partnering Us in this Enterprise and I hope in the coming years that this would become the premier India Australian Forum where we can discuss issues of common interest now we all you know you spoke about it as a curtain racer and so in a sense I would like to share with all of you some of the issues which would happen at the beginning of next month in Delhi uh let me first say that at this time it's important we all appreciate that the larger Outlook as we see the world is one of great uncertainty a lot of unpredictability new players new Behavior and by the way I'm talking about the Delhi test between India and Australia now this applies to some degree to actually to the world scenario as well and if we put together really the the cumulative impact of three years of covet the damage that it has done to the global socio-economic fabric the year of the Ukraine conflict the nokon affects the fuel food fertilizer trade disruptions the shortages it has created the uncertainties it has enhanced and then take some of the perennial challenges which pre-existed climate now climate was a growing concern I think in the last few years what we thought the future portended has actually happened to us so we are witnessing climate events on a increasingly larger more catastrophic scale and in fact today in any Global risk assessment I would say building in a climate calculation is very much a part of that and uh you know there are the other concerns concerns about terrorism concerns about Maritime security there are also growing concerns about financial sustainability uh I think there are more than 70 countries who have or are engaging the IMF in terms of stabilizing the the national finances and unlike in the near past many of these are not low income countries some of them are middle-income countries so uh I think even um even even an optimistic view of the world would be reasonably pessimistic at this point of time my second Point flowing from that if there is today really an urgent Collective task it is how to de-risk the global economy and part of that is you know exactly the events that I have referred to uh over dependence on manufacturing over dependence on energy over dependence on services so how do we create more reliable and resilient Supply chains in a more digital world how do we how do we ensure at least the minimal trust and transparency uh because the fact is that we cannot be agnostic about data in the manner in which beware mistakenly agnostic about products you know where my data resides who processes it what do they do with it how do they extrapolate it matters deeply to me so for us to pretend that all nations are the same and it's none of our business what happens inside I think that era is now behind us and we must not just accept it we must actually be aware of it and make plans to to deal with this and in fact Minister Bhavan and I were just discussing this applies as well to green technologies you know we should not end up you know in a world where our desire to be greener leads us to be more dependent on a few and therefore more insecure so how do we decentralize how do we collaborate how do we diversify uh in a sense how do we democratize the world democratize it technologically democratize it economically I think this is uh I would say the uh the second point which I would flag for your attention now if I were to pick three words to to put before you the state of our contemporary world uh those three words for me would be number one globalization uh because globalization has worked it's had its problems it's had its downsides but it's hard actually an enormous impact both the pluses and minuses on global Society globalization actually has helped to create a rebalancing uh you spoke Justin about our G20 presidency G20 itself is proof of that rebalancing that till 2008 the Global Leadership such as it was uh was seen as G7 and the fact was that the events of 2008-2009 demonstrated that G7 was too narrow so uh I I use G20 but I would not stop at G20 I use that as a metaphor to to underline the point that if you look today at the production and consumption centers of the world they are vastly different certainly from what they were in 1945 but I would say almost every decade it's very useful to actually see a decadel chart of who's up and who's down and how the balances are shifting there and flowing from that rebalancing that rebalancing today is and I use the word present continuous here is actually creating uh an emerging multipolarity uh that they will still I mean the United States to my mind has been the premier power in the foreseeable future I still see it as the premium Premier power and clearly the rise of China the share of China and global economy in global technology in global influence these are undeniable factors but the fact is that in the let us say let's take this decade you're clearly going to see many more Powers who will have more influence on global debates and Global outcomes uh than they did before and to my mind certainly some of them would be sufficiently separated from the rest of the herd to be seen as a pole and therefore you will have multipolarity uh since brexit uh there's obviously been a very intense Global debate about globalization and president Trump's election sort of intensified that debate if I can put it that way but to my mind you know it's not an issue of is globalization good or bad you can't turn it back it's there for real it's hardwired into our existence the issue is really what's the right model of globalization that is it a model which is fairer which is fairer within societies fairer between societies is it a model where the benefits exceed the vulnerabilities because that is today also a very important downside of globalization so I think that's to my mind actually a key Global debate so one is de-risking the global economy but the second really is the the model the preferred direction of globalization that a lot of countries want to see now in a changing World obviously there will be new conversations and among the conversations we are seeing uh is the are those of the importance of values of beliefs of ideologies uh not just in a in a very antiseptic way of Interest and there is a whole debate which flows out of that you know ah one debate of course is that of democratic countries pluralistic societies and those who are not but there's another debate and it's a debate within the Democratic World which is really whose democracy whose values whose definition whose norms because here too the the the transformation of the world the rebalancing a lot of it derives from an era of I would say a G7 dominance a very euro-atlantic view of what is democracy now the fact if I can put it somewhat immoristly the fact that democracy is perceived as a global uh aspiration is actually because India chose to be a democracy at the time of its independence and because the first country which was decolonizing and it happened to be the largest country which was decolonizing chose a difficult Democratic path and then despite Decades of adversity unlimited resources stuck to that path and stuck to that path when actually other democracies questioned the viability of that path that today is very much I think uh at the center of a debate and a conversation that we must have on Democracy that there are practices and beliefs and cultures which are relevant to how democracy is actually executed and and improved ah my next point of course is the welfare of the world and here again the fact that uh the capacities of some countries are not what they used to be is a very relevant factor I particularly refer here to the United States uh for me the big change in the last decade is not that the U.S capacities are relatively uh less than what they used to be it is that the U.S is actually getting into a mindset where it's aware of that limitation and is open to working with like-minded Partners to address it and like-minded partners include countries who are not treaty allies now in Australia it's not a change you will readily realize because you are a treaty Ally for you working with the United States is not anything new it's part of your history for the last eight years for us it is so and it's you know certainly I I would uh I would uh emphasize that uh there have been big changes in our foreign policy but I would equally stress that there's been a big change in American thinking that this is not the same United States with which we dealt with in the 60s or 80s or even frankly in 2005. that there is an evolution out there and that Evolution today you can see on a whole range of issues uh and as a result we actually today have new strategic Concepts new third geopolitical theaters if you would new mechanisms and obviously the most notable of these uh in terms of uh on a conceptual level is the indo-pacific at a mechanism level is the quad and the quote to me is a very very uh you know it's an Enterprise Laden with a lot of significance because if you look at it there's that indo-pacific space four countries not geographically contiguous at all with an enormous amount of sea space and some land space between them but who have in different ways overcome their own past Outlook to forge something common in response to a perceived Global and Regional need and uh it's uh it's an Endeavor with which I happen perhaps to be Associated most more closely than most others I'm still probably the only witness in office of the first effort in 2007. uh and I've seen it at various levels from uh you know doing it as a permanent secretary to a foreign minister and now we're seeing it as a summit level and Australia will be hosting the summit soon ah so it is to my mind uh a development of great consequence uh and uh I would say that not just us I look at the foreign policy of our other quad Partners as well I think today it has a salience which uh very few would have predicted perhaps even two or three years ago so finally uh let me end with a few thoughts uh on my uh on our G20 presidency uh it's obviously uh an extraordinary opportunity it's a great honor uh it's a time when you have a certain convening power and an agenda shaping opportunity but it's also as I said initially a particularly difficult juncture of world politics uh we were you know the way the G20 works it works as a Troika so the incoming and the outgoing are associated with the current chair so we you know we had some visibility perhaps a little more than visibility some role as well a supportive role uh when our producers are chair Indonesia was holding that responsibility so we know that last year was a real struggle uh the Ukraine conflict had a very strongly polarized the G20 uh we've all of us worked very hard to find some kind of common ground on that issue I believe that we did succeed finally at the Bali Summit and I really think an enormous amount of credit is due to Indonesian patience and creativity in that regard but today the rest of the world expects the G20 to address its concerns because the rest of the world actually and the rest of the world is another about 180 countries that they have real problems pressing problems deep concerns and they think it is for the G20 as the top 20 economies of the world to show the direction to come up with answers to at the very least be cognizant and so if not sympathetic of that concerns so our hope is that we are able to steer the G20 in the direction uh in which it should go to uh to uh undertake the responsibilities the remit with which the G20 was originally tossed which was economic growth and Global development and we are doing this not as a just as a H shall I say feeling the the wipes from the rest of the world we actually did it as a as a practical empirical exercise uh in the month of January we actually consulted 123 countries and consulted means that the level of prime minister himself and cabinet ministers we have a good sense today by asking the word literally asking the world saying here we are with this responsibility what is it which is uppermost in your mind what is it which is your most pressing concern and what can we do about it so today I I just conclude by saying that I had the pleasure of meeting the Prime Minister this morning of spending time with my counterpart Penny Wong this afternoon I think from what I can see the Australian view is very much aligned with the thinking which I have put forward uh for me this relationship is exceptionally important and I can only underline that by the frequency of my visits that it is exceptionally important it would for us make a big difference in the G20 in the quad bilaterally and I think regionally as well you know I'm coming here after spending three days in Fiji so do bear in mind that the India that I represent today is also in India whose influence and interests and footprint is growing in the world uh we feel we can be of uh of uh utility and support in regions which may not be that proximate to us so that too has been part of my conversations uh in Australia so once again I I would thank both SP and ORF for providing me the opportunity to share some thoughts about our relationship about my visit but most important to show you the first trailer about what's going to happen in Russian dialogue thank you very much thank you very much outside that window 235 years ago 11 ships sailed through those magnificent heads and the lives of a woman called barangaroo who are now honor just near here and her husband along who's honored by the name across the way changed forever and the lives of all our first Nations people changed Forever on that day which we must acknowledge as we celebrate their Elders past present and emerging and of course later this year our country will have the opportunity for our most important ever Act of reconciliation recognizing our first peoples in our Constitution and providing them with an enshrined voice to Parliament and that's an opportunity for Australia to show ourselves and to show the world that modern Australia honors and cherishes our first peoples and it's important to our country to partner with them as we work to eradicate disadvantage well thank you uh SP and ORF for convening this important and inaugural Rosina at Sydney dialogue and at the outset can I acknowledge my colleague Dr jaishanker now Dr joshenka you are not only the foreign minister of an important friend but you should be acknowledged as one of the most thoughtful and impactful thinkers and thought matters on matters relating to our complicated region we've heard some of those thoughts today and your book the India way strategies for an uncertain world is important not just not is important not just for those of us with a deep interest in India but all of us with an interest in the role of middle powers in a time of bipolar geopolitical contest so if you haven't read Dr Jai shanker's book I highly recommend it it's a very good read and the fact that this is your second visit to Australia in just six months I think underlines the importance you place on the relationship which we deeply respect and we deeply acknowledge the prime minister is very much looking forward to his bilateral visit to India in March and I predict discussions on climate and energy will figure prominently in discussions between Prime Minister Modi and prime minister Albanese which of course are very much welcome now this is an excellent year for India to chair the G20 and from my point of view importantly also chair the clean energy ministerial an important Partnership of the world's key economies working together to accelerate the global energy transformation it's a very important meeting six thousand delegates uh usually attend the clean energy ministerial it'll be a very big meeting now there's some disagreement among statisticians about whether India has just become the world's most populous nation or is about to become the world's most populous nation in the next month or so but either way India is taking its place at the top of the global population mountain and the theme of India's G20 presidency one Earth one family one future to me is an indication of the importance India is going to place on an interconnected sustainability of course there's no more important element to interconnected sustainability than ensuring that we are tackling climate change and I want to acknowledge the enormous effort that I know India is putting into the meeting of the First Energy transition working group my officials just returned from India just this last week for planning meetings and they've reported to me just how much effort uh as we would now would expect G20 uh chair India is putting into their role as host and I'm very much looking forward to attending not only the clean energy ministerial and G20 energy ministers meeting in Goa but also the G20 environmental ministers stream in Chennai a little while afterwards I want to make this point very clearly as I have directly with Minister joshenka earlier there is no stronger supporter of G20 chairmanship by India than Australia we will support you in every way possible and partnership with you in partnership with you in this important role and I welcome Minister puri's message at the India energy week just last week that India will use the presidency not only to give residents to the voice of developing an underdeveloped countries but also when I quote highlight the common concerns of energy security energy Justice and sustainable energy energy transition so that developing countries can gain reliable and clean energy and of course we very much welcome that because when it comes to the response to the climate crisis and the massive energy transformation I see Australia and India as key and increasingly important partners the partnership has already begun I had the privilege of co-chairing with Minister bhupender yadev the climate Finance negotiations of cop 27 in Charlotte a critical piece of work and I'm glad we were able to make some progress Minister yadav and I in sharing those conversations and energy Minister r.k Singh came to Australia just six months ago this very shortly after our election I think he was my first bilateral visitor uh and he attended the Sydney energy forum and we also engaged in the first ever quad energy ministers meeting during his presence and I was impressed by rk's incredible focus and thought leadership on the important matter of improving solar panel efficiency he's very passionate about it and it's very critical to ensuring that we take the resources we have and make sure that they are working to maximum capacity I was very pleased to be able to take RK and give him a tour and to show off uh the Australian Ingenuity at the birthplace of the modern solar panel in randwick the University of New South Wales School of Hotel overtake and renewable energy in I know he was impressed he's raised with me when I've seen him since in other International meetings so India's chairmanship with the G20 and hosting the cem isn't important to take up important opportunity to take our partnership and speaking frankly India's level of climate leadership to new levels and fatty barole made this point just last week on his visit to India he's of course the president of the International Energy agency and he said India can help Drive the global energy agenda on clean energy Transitions and energy security with its focus on addressing techno technology gaps and ensuring Diversified Supply chains scaling up clean fuels for the future and mobilizing investment now I'd like to in the time available to me today focus on two matters which I think will be very important for the world this year very important for Australia very important for India's chairmanship of G20 and important for both our countries and that's the urgent need for collaboration between all like-minded countries on renewable energy Supply chains and Minister referred to this in his remarks and secondly I want to touch briefly on what our regard as the equally urgent need for a greater effort from our multilateral development banks on climate financing now the Nexus between the global energy crisis sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the significant and urgent need to scale up renewable energy production and capacity in coming years both serve as an important backdrop for today's discussion and indeed for the meetings that are going to occur this year but equally we need more than ever strong and resilient Supply chains and I'll be very Frank we can't swap what has been in some parts of the world an over-reliance on one form of energy gas from Russia with an over concentration on renewable energy Supply chains which are geographically concentrated as well that would be a backward step energy security requires supply chain security and what that means resilient and diverse clean energy Supply chains accompanied by diversity of potential suppliers now I want to make it very clear and I want to make it simple in Australia we want to manufacture more things more elements in the renewable energy supply chain more solar panels more inverters more Transformers more batteries all the above but we also want India doing the same and we very much welcome India's efforts under Prime Minister Modi to do just that because we need trusted and reliable trading partners being more active in manufacturing of the energy supply chain and India is a trusted and reliable trading partner Excellence it's in all our interests to make this reality so we all need to be stepping up uh and I know it will feature prominently in the quad energy ministers meetings discussions we'll be having this year featured prominently in our first ever meeting of quad energy ministers last year I know it will figure in all the discussions and we will welcome and support sensible discussions about diversification of renewable energy Supply chains through the G20 now as I've noted the transformation to becoming a renewable any economy a renewable economy around the world is the biggest economic change since the Industrial Revolution but we're undertaking this transformation more quickly than our fourth others had to do to have the best chance of holding the world as close as possible to 1.5 degrees of warming we need to maximize emissions reduction between now and 2030. now friends 2030 might seem like a long way away it is 83 months away that is not long to engineer this massive economic transformation in this short period of time we are going to need to be all in governments of all levels National regional and local that certainly the case in Australia and I believe the case in India Civil Society trade unions industry all of us coming together on this massive transformation but importantly also multilateral development organizations multilateral development Banks cannot be passengers on this journey we need them stepping up much more at cop 27 in Egypt in my national statement I made the point that our International Financial architecture was built for a different time and is in need of modernization and I was pleased that the cover decision from charmel Sheikh reflected this and included a reference to multilateral development Banks to define a new model fit for purpose of addressing the climate emergency this reflects the growing calls for change perhaps best exemplified by the Prime Minister of Barbados and her important Bridgetown initiative these are important words but this year we have to see more of the words we need to see action we need to see progress and I think countries like Australia and India can play an important role in bringing the passion and the thoughts behind things like the Bridgetown initiative to ensure practical achievable steps forward in multilateral Development Bank reform in particular while public sector investment is important it's more impactful if it leverages additional private sector investment now in 2021 every dollar of climate Finance created by an MDB generated 25 25 cents of new private Finance for every one dollar they generated 25 cents of private Finance surely we can do better than that surely they can leverage more private sector investment than that so again I think countries like Australia and India without different perspectives uh can work together to develop and promote practical achievable and verifiable improvements to the way mdbs do their work now I've been impressed it's important we don't over generalize I've been very impressed by the work of the Asian development Bank working across our region on the energy transition but we have not seen and we need to be frank that level of commitment from other multilateral development Banks now I note the news this week that the current president of the World Bank will leave his position early this provides an opportunity to reset the leadership of the bank and ensure the centrality of the climate challenge at the core of their work now of course neither the G20 nor the cop are decision makers when it comes to MDB governance that's a matter for their respective boards but both the G20 and the cop are unparalleled opportunities for like-minded countries to make their views and expectations crystal clear and we expect mdbs to be stepping up to the task and we expect to see real action from mdds to improve on this the most important matter on the global agenda so friends in conclusion when I first visited India in 1998 as a tourist I fell in love with the country I have to be honest with you and say I've been back so many times that I have honestly lost count I don't know how many times I've been back it's into double figures I know that but when I was first in Goa 25 years ago well I knew I'd be returning often to India little did I realize or contemplate or imagined that 25 years later I'd be back in Goa collaborating with the Indian Minister on the challenges of our times we know that is the Indian and Australian governments how high the stakes are we know it we've lived it we've both been ravaged by natural disasters in recent times last year India saw extreme weather events across the country during 80 percent of the year including the May floods which caused the loss of life and significant crops in Australia 68 of Australians were living in an area covered by a natural disaster declaration in 2022 at some point 68 of our population at some point covered by a natural disaster declaration with some of the areas experiencing back-to-back multiple declarations Time After Time and some areas hit by bushfires and then floods so our Nations don't know our Nations don't just know what will happen if we don't act on climate change we know that those impacts are here and the live reality now and that makes case for Action ever ever more urgent natural disasters are becoming more severe more frequent and increasingly less natural and of course that's before we even get to the matter of daily Heat both our countries have a beautiful environment But Rising heat and prolonged heat waves have huge Health implications particularly for our elderly and less well-off who can't live can't afford air conditioning live in areas where heat waves are being experienced for longer and long and that has its biggest impact on our elderly and most vulnerable so we all have an imperative fraction we have the reason we have the will and with the ability to collaborate and 2023 will be a key year for collaboration between India and Australia and I look forward to doing much more of that this year thank you for your time [Applause] thank you both ministers for those remarks uh I know we uh have a reasonably hard deadline uh so we'll get straight into some uh questions couple uh from uh me and then we'll try and get into the audience if that's okay uh Dr joshenka you mentioned your remarks that you have just come from Fiji with India's near region considered to be the Indian Ocean countries can you give us your assessment of the Pacific what it means to India and what you see is opportunities for India Australia collaboration well uh you know if I were to speak about the Pacific broadly one of the big changes which has happened in India over the last three decades is that the bulk of our trade has actually shifted eastwards it's more than 50 percent of our trade today is two countries east of India obviously most of them are Pacific countries and that's in a way uh a huge shift from the earlier colonial era trade patterns and routings which were centered around the western coast and to European and Middle Eastern markets uh specifically where the Pacific Islands are concerned because I was in Fiji again uh these are this is a region where we have we have uh some history uh I think the first set of Indian immigrants came to Fiji for example I think in 1879 does a large Fijian Indian Community there so one part of our interest is obviously the historical cultural linkages but in recent years as our own you know we have ourselves globalized globalized in thinking of our interests in global terms we actually created a forum called forum for India Pacific island cooperation uh we've had two meetings the Sudan by prime minister mudit was one of his early initiatives in 2014 we've done two meetings we would have done a third but for the covet we hope to do it this year and we today have development assistance programs in every one of the Pacific Islands we were providers of vaccines during covet to about five of them if my memory serves we had five or six of them uh certainly to Fiji are now but to a number of others as well uh so I think what you should expect to see is a greater Indian presence a greater Indian commitment because it's not just a political commitment it's also a sustainability commitment you know and in many you know there are islands where we're active in health uh some of them in we are getting into education so uh it's it's therefore a region and a subject where we hope to consult very closely with Australia and work together in a way in which our convergences are enhanced right I mean you see clearly see the convergence is there as well yeah absolutely um obviously our government has had much deeper engagement with the Pacific as one of our key perhaps our perhaps our key foreign policy uh initiative since May but we've also noticed a very much welcome the engagement of like-minded countries in the Pacific and and step up um India is one I've discussed with my friend Jean-Pierre the potential collaboration for more collaboration between Australia and France and climate financing in the Pacific for example um Germany's just uh appointed a new Ambassador for the Pacific so we very much welcome all these uh steps up from step UPS steps up uh from around the world uh in in deeper engagement uh in the Pacific and there are key opportunities I think for ongoing Partnerships of Australia working with countries like India on projects right throughout the Pacific like before asking if the anyone in the audience has a question on for the two ministers Dr Joshua a lot of your commentary uh was um uh focused on democracy and furthering democracy and different forms of democracy there are occasional comments that we see on the undermining of democracy in India most recently in the context of the BBC and just yesterday at the Munich security conference uh George Soros spoke on on many issues but specifically on open and closed societies and called on institutional reform in India how do you as foreign minister of India explain this when you're dealing with your quad ministers in particular as well as others well uh look uh I I actually made two points one how the world is changing it is rebalancing it is less Euro Atlantic I don't think everybody gets that I think old habits die hard I mean very candidly uh there are there are still people in the world who believe that their definition their preferences their views uh must override everything else so since you mentioned this specific example I I don't know how familiar people are with what was said at the Munich conference essentially Mr sorrow said India is a democratic country but he doesn't think the prime minister of India is a Democrat uh and uh by the way a few years ago in the same conference I was there at that time he actually accused us of planning to strip millions of Muslims of their citizenship which of course didn't happen it was a ridiculous suggestion but you have to understand what this actually means ah I could take a view that the individual in question Mr Soros is a old Rich opinionated person sitting in New York who still thinks that his views should determine how the entire world works now if I could only stop at Old rich and opinionated I would put it away but his old Rich opinionated and dangerous you know because what happens is when such people and such views and such organizations they actually invest resources in shaping narratives you know I I spoke about globalization now what globalization does is it actually creates a lot of the seamlessness of globalization which creates all the opportunities also allows you know narratives to be shaped money to come in uh you know foundations to go about their their agenda now in this particular case I mean it is very clear that he has very strong political preferences he actually thinks that I mean doesn't matter that this is a country of 1.4 billion people we're almost there who whose voters decide how the country should run he actually thinks well if you know uh and and again I cite him as an extreme example okay but it's it's there are other uh you know manifestations of this in in different countries where people like him think uh an election is good if the person we want to see wins if the election throws up a different uh outcome then we actually will say it's a flawed democracy ah and you know this to my and and the beauty is all this is done under the pretense of advocacy of open open Society of transparency Etc so uh Our Generation we have grown up with Concepts like regime change uh which influence operations now you can call it what you will I mean to me this really looks the same with a gloss of some kind of do Buddhism on it so for me it's actually necessary today that you have we have today a serious conversation uh on Democracy you know uh I I when I look at my own democracy I've been I have today a water turnout which is unprecedented uh electoral outcomes which are decisive electoral processes which are not questioned we are not one of those countries where after the election somebody goes to arbitrate in court okay we don't have any hanging charts either and you know where you actually say uh I will sit in judgment over the verdict about us now my sense of democracy is the water is supposed to decide and it worries us it worries us because look we are a country which went through colonialism we know the dangers of what happens when there is outside interference in whatever guys uh in your politics if if you do this kind of scare mongering like millions of people will be deprived of citizenship it actually does real damage to a societal fabric because somebody out there believes you and somebody and you don't leave it to accident by the way you back it up with an operation so you create that kind of fear psychosis and then you use that to validate your original judgment so I I do think today between you know what who's democracy who's globalization uh why you know the transparency of how uh Global processes work these are real issues which need to be debated thank you and it's been I was I was going to ask you a uh renewable energy question but uh with with timing uh might get one from the audience anyway if it's okay I'll uh I've got a couple of hands up I think the Australia India Business Council uh had a uh had the first question kind of I represent the Australia India Chamber of Commerce Chamber of Commerce apologies thank you anyway um also a worthy body and thank you to both speakers um I I have a question for Minister Bowen um India is a as we know a rapidly growing and developing nation and it has a great and growing energy needs and I think currently has about 20 nuclear actors am I right something like that um we have 37 news 37 I think so I mean more than I thought yeah um at one point Australia did export uranium to India um is there any thought or any possibility given that we export to other nations that exports to uranium could go to India well there's certainly no um no impediment in terms of uh political party decisions um one saw the necessary arrangements have been made so I wouldn't have misused any change in approach trying to change the government on that matter it's simply just working the issues through but certainly there's absolutely no um no I think imperative if the or the legal requirements under Australian law or an Australian International obligations could be met but I think there are certain treaty obligations which also need to be considered uh which we would have to honor and we would have to be satisfied of um and that's a that's a standard requirement across all trading partners that's not a specific common in relation to India I saw Gordon flake all the way from Perth for the uh Rosina at Sydney fantastic to have you here Gordon delighted to make sure that we've got coverage from Australia's Indian Ocean Capital um Gordon flake with the Perth us Asia Center a question from Minister Jay Shankar I wonder if I might get your reaction to the comments that Minister Bowen made about the importance of renewable energy Supply chains and his focus on India as a trust and reliable partner par Excellence we had last year both your military colleagues Mr Joshi Minister goyal visit uh in October the Japanese prime minister visited Western Australia with an intense focus on those clean energy Supply chains with the notion that the road to Future Energy went through Australia I wonder if you might address and respond to minister Bowen's comments in terms of how India views Australia when it comes to energy security and Future Energy you know uh I'm a kind of I'm not an energy guy but I'm a sort of Jack of all trades so I'll I'll have a shot at the answer uh my sense is a lot of countries are really looking at their energy future uh they're real looking at the energy future uh for some of the reasons which minister Bowen spoke about that there's today a great deal of anxiety on the fossil fuel on the accessibility of the affordability of the volatility of those markets ah does worry when it comes to Renewables that you know are we excessively dependent on particular geographies and you know there could be disruptions there but there could be leveraging there call it what you will but dependence is dependence so uh to my mind what happens and what has happened even in the past when the world starts getting nervous about a particular set of concerns thus almost a intuitive sense in the world the let's go out there and look for different solutions different Arrangements uh different transactions which will as I said de-risk all of us I think when we in in our case we are thinking about it very actively we know we are not the only country which is thinking about it it's also been a subject of conversation in the quad uh in in other other formats as well I would say uh and certainly we see Australia as a particularly important partner here uh because uh you know if if the future we see the future as more renewable we see the future as more nuclear we see the future as more green hydrogen green ammonia now each of these which we see EV will mean the capital letters will become stronger with the passage of time or many of these roads do lead to Australia so I do think that the energy side of our relationship but I wouldn't put it just as energy I would really put it as a kind of an economic security side of the relationship really growing in in times to come do you want to respond to any of that your line of energy security needs supply chain security I think was very important yeah I'm not sure I can add too much to what I said at the podium and I do think it is in many senses issue one two and three for energy ministers around the world um it would just be it is just unthinkable to for this important transition to be reliant on a geographically specific supply chain as we are and I think of things which could slow down our transition Renewables I can think of a few when I think of things which could stop our transition Renewables I can really only think of one and that is the disruption to supply chains from for solar panels batteries inverters electrolyzers All the Above I mean I just it could stop us and so we need to diversify as a matter of great urgency I think we have one more question uh before needing to uh um are you on to your next meetings might require short answers please go ahead Jasmine Crawford Hill from the Australia India youth dialogue um we've heard about democratizing and diversifying manufacturing and Supply chains but nothing about the beginning of that cycle about the need to democratize and potentially diversify r d and who holds IP and I think we did start to see this through covert with vaccines and access uh what does it look like if we don't talk about embedding values and culture not just into our manufacturing Supply chains but into our research then is there a need for us to lead the region in democratizing research as well we we already share our r d with the world a little bit too much for my liking sometimes um because the modern solar panel was invented as I said in randwick uh literally the perk um technology which is in 98 of the world's solar panels came from the University of New South Wales in collaboration with the Australian National University but we have exported all the expertise to turning that into Manufacturing uh in and not and not in a good way in that we don't we we manufacture a small number of solar panels in Australia uh one percent of the solar panels we use are made in Australia but they're all invented in Australia and almost almost all the solar panels around the world are in effect a modern Australian invention in the latest technology now there's some uh good signs uh arising out of the University of New South Wales is the latest research which is replacing copper with silver inside the solar panel which much to our friend and Dr jashank is Minister or colleague and my friend RK shing's Delight um is now the most efficient solar panel in the world and can potentially be scaled up to production and they are looking to produce it in Australia um so that there are all big steps forward but I I don't think there's any problem with sharing Australian IP uh I I think it's uh I think it's gone a bit too far the other way you know from an Indian perspective this is a very valid question because it's been a big source of concern for us when it comes to policy making a sense that we are under invested in r d uh and we are I think a large part of the problem derives from the fact that we are under invested in manufacturing so you can't you know you can't have a strong r d economy and a weak manufacturing economy they don't go together and in previous years but honestly we made life difficult for ourselves when it came to manufacturing through a set of policy decisions which were taken ah and a lot of our uh in inabilities and uh shortcomings were actually rationalizing you know we are Indians our real strengthens and services which was a good cop-out of what you failed to do that is today getting at rest so if you look at the last few years there's been a huge push to expand and intensify Manufacturing does even the the HR Support I mean the the emphasis on skills on vocational education on Innovation on startups on patents this is almost like a new culture which is which is taking place and I can see it actually taking root you know I I I visit a lot of educational institutions uh uh across India uh 10 years ago if I went somewhere they would Trot out the best five students and say you know these are the gold medalists of our institution today they say you know give us half an hour we want to put a display and we want to introduce you to five people who hold patents while they're still studying in the University that to me is a big mindset shift I accept that we have a long way to go there I I think the Prime Minister and the government knows that but it is today a course correction that we have made I think we have made that very decisively we now need to really intensify it we have this uh this uh initiative called production linked incentive program which is designed to actually get uh you know countries to come in collaborate with us I'm hearing more and more uh you know anecdotal evidence of global companies setting r d up in India we're trying to make it easier for them so yes work in progress but honestly a lot of work to be done all right thank you thank you for the question uh Minister Josh thank you

Raisina Dialogue Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/raisinaofficial",1,well good morning it's a um total Delight to be here even on a Saturday morning it's uh it's very very good to see you all uh what a what what an important um event this is uh the recenter dialogue in uh in Sydney um what a coup to um for this first time in Sydney to have his Excellence either uh Indian Minister for external Affairs Dr Joe Shanker I'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which this event has been held to get Eagle people First Nations connections to this country stretched back 65 000 years the oldest the oldest continuous culture on Earth it is um it is a very important um put aside the history and culture and the challenges that Australia like many countries around the world has in Reckoning with its own history and own culture but what a what a what a marvelous asset for Australia 65 000 years of continuous culture pay my respects to Elders past and present uh I want to thank uh Ashby and the Observer Research Foundation for their invitation and for their valuable contributions to our thinking on strategic policy in Australia uh in India and globally I I was saying to Justin this morning you know amongst the many contributions that aspie has made getting Australian policy makers to think about uh industry capability and Sovereign capability in a new way has been a really a five-year achievement and aspie has played a critical role in that taking Australian policy makers beyond the old Orthodoxy that um that an open market approach to trade an open market approach to our economy and a strong industry policy approach were incompatible policy objectives it's not uh not an approach that many of our friends around the world including our friends in India have struggled with but an Australia policymakers saw these as irreconcilable and and as we has played I think a very important role in Breaking that down so there is a new determination uh from the new Albanese government to rebuild industrial capability there is equally a determination to maintain our commitments to open markets uh to a global trading regime that's based on rules and to not uh in this very challenging period revert to protectionism because that would be a disaster for the Australian economy as well so that's the challenge that's in front of us um I it is a real honor to be able to introduce India's Minister for external Affairs uh Dr joshenka who's a frequent and very welcome visitor to these Shores he is um a a a rare thing in international Affairs a in uh for democratic nations a a foreign minister who is a foreigner has been a foreign affairs practitioner his whole life um a uh we have our soldier Scholars uh and he is our our Foreign Affairs scholar who's made a big contribution in his own in in his own right prior to his political career uh in international relations and I know prime minister Albanese and a series of other senior ministers are looking forward to uh to their meetings with you today and that they place a great importance uh on today's discussions and later this year of course Australia is looking forward to hosting the quad leaders meetings and to India's leadership role hosting the G20 meetings in September um Dr joshenka ladies and gentlemen the Albanese government has a deep regard for our relationship with India it's one of the great democracies of the world uh and of course the largest democracy in the world of course last year we celebrated 75 years of Indian independence and in fact there were celebrations with thousands of people engaged across Australia in the 75-year Independence Day Celebrations and they were very colorful vibrant uh events indeed the relationship between Australia and India is enduring and it is deep it spans oceans and Industry and and industries it has enriched Australia's culture as well as our economy and it makes us a stronger and better place the Indian diaspora in Australia is a core part of Australia's Multicultural makeup almost a million people in Australia claim Indian Heritage in last year's budget the government made a substantive investment to advance Australia's strategic and economic cooperation with India our joint programs and initiatives include funding research collaborations in science in science and technology strengthening critical mineral Supply chains and projects and promoting our creative and cultural Industries and we're working together to build the peace prosperity and stability of our region through groupings like the quad and within structures like the indo-pacific economic framework there is very that there is a lot to look forward to in the australia-india relationship the australia-india economic cooperation trade agreement I actor entered into Force at the end of last year despite despite some predictions I have to say that that it would struggle to make its way throughout through our respective systems some unhelpful predictions made by and I saw by a colleague of a colleague of mine who just lost government um it sailed through the parliament sailed through the parliament because because everybody in the parliament um Everybody in the government understands how important this relationship is is the world's fastest growing major economy India offers vast opportunities for Australian jobs and economic prosperity and for joint industrial technological and energy collaboration and cooperation so we're eager as a government to build on the strong foundations laid by actor by negotiating uh the next round uh comprehensive round of uh that important trading agreement as a minister of trade Don Farrell has written the Australian government sees significant potential for greater exchange of ideas and talent as our people-to-people links grow uh I'm so pleased to see all of these Business Leaders here today you know to work through how we operationalize and make practical uh this cooperation I'm also pleased to see so many talented Indian students have returned to Australia after the pandemic you know we we uh sometimes in our press we see uh the debate about International students is a little narrow it's seen as an industry a sector where um where students are counted as uh as uh items on our sort of export and import balance sheet truth is educating students here in Australia is one of the things that we're proudest of we see it as a solemn contract between us and the parents I always call them kids I mean they're mostly postgraduate students but I see them as kids because I'm so old you know it's just it's a it's a it's a solemn undertaking to look after young people at this formative stage of their lives and we take that very seriously and it's a delight to see International students particularly Indian International students returning to Australia in such great numbers to make the most of the talents and energy of the Indian Australia community the government has established a new center for Australia India relations right here in New South Wales and I'm very pleased to acknowledge the presence of Swati Dave uh today Ms Darby who I've known for many years um was most recently the managing director and chief executive officer of export Finance Australia which is our key overseas financing bank and was last week the announcement was made that she's been appointed the inaugural chair of The Advisory board for the center it's a very fine appointment it's right that we really look forward to working with you in this role I look forward to working with the center to increase Australian businesses India literacy support two-way policy dialogues and maintain a range of Australia India matre friendship programs we are deeply committed to the relationship and it's good to see uh Michaela Browning here from Google Jody McKay from the Australia India Business Council it's it's uh it's an extraordinary development really um Jody and swathi both uh but who I've both known for a very long time both arriving in these critical roles it's in in the Australia India relationship it's a very good sign I think for the future of this relationship um I am I just say at the end this this relationship in my view is vital for our national interests for our regional security for our prosperity for the uh for the for the future of both of our peoples um it is a it is an absolute Delight minister to introduce you um uh to this group uh Dr joshanker is an exceptional thinker and scholar in the foreign policy space I know that this audience is very much looking forward to hearing from him and uh and we are very honored to have you uh in this fine City on what is going to be a very very hot day thank you [Applause] pretty please but a very good morning it's not that early but uh but it's really wonderful to be back here and uh I think uh Justin and Samir I need to thank you both for for making this event possible Senator thank you very much for your warm buds what I thought would be the most useful thing that I could do for all of you is really speak a little bit about how we see the relationship but more important perhaps share with you uh how I see you know the Indian landscape changing and you know why that is relevant for you and when I say I see the Indian landscape changing in a way I bring multiple perspectives to Bear the objectivity of someone who spent a lot of time outside his own country who keeps looking back at it and who who in a way is a sort of marketing department of the country for 40 years so so you have to know your product well to you know to Market it effectively outside and then a brief corporate education which was you know very very useful very brief unfortunately and four years as a practicing politician and believe me the speed of Education there's even faster and really when you go around I I would say to me the the real discovery of being a politician is how much time you spend really on the on the road I mean on on the street and and the kind of things you pick up there and uh the impact of changes which uh otherwise you you look at it much more theoretically if you're just living in a capital city but let me kind of dial back a bit come you know look at the relationship itself and I think I I would very much go what the senator said which is today's world I think the state of the world creates a very compelling case for India and Australia to do more with each other for quite a few years now for more than a decade I think we can see the the the direction the world is going in uh it's it's in transition now that's a that's a very nice word which pretty much describes anything at any time but the bottom line is uh us the the sense of stability the factors of permanence in our calculation that we had for many tickets uh have in the last decade you know they've been question marks and there have been question marks I mean we can debate it's a good thing or a bad thing but it doesn't matter it's it's happening uh and it's necessary for countries like India and Australia here to work more closely to shape the direction in which the world is going but there's a much more immediate context and the context is especially that of the last three years uh there was already this transition going on uh and uh the way they were I think trade concerns uh there were Financial concerns and then came the covet and the impact of the kobit has been devastating uh on the world economy perhaps we in India and Australia feel it much less as someone who travels a fair amount to other parts of the world you know when I when I we we look at Africa and Central America and you know some other parts of Asia I look at my own neighborhood you know Sri Lanka Bangladesh Nepal you can see really how much damage economic damage social damage psychological damage the covet has done and then if that wasn't enough there came the Ukraine conflict uh so today uh I would actually in in terms of foreign policy uh for me one of the big goals would really be uh how do you de-risk the global economy and you de-risk the global economy uh one by building more reliable and resilient Supply chains which is exactly one of the initiatives that India and Australia and Japan have embarked on two how do we address the challenges of the digital world much more securely much more credibly and there you know that that's a whole new set of issues and a set of policies out there which have uh uh you know there it's not without its geopolitical aspects and the third of course what are the important relationships which can which can serve as stabilizers really for for uh for a sort of world economy heading into choppy water as well but a few years ahead now uh what we are going to see I think on the bilateral fund up front hopefully is your Senator referred to the passage of the actor and I think in a larger sense there's the comprehensive strategic partnership which which uh sort of uh sets The Narrative the framework really for the relationship and how to take it Forward uh I think it's hugely helpful uh to have high level contacts to have CEO forums to have trade ministers so in the coming days and weeks I expect to see a lot of activity on that front and I think it's really when business meets business when Prime Ministers meet Prime Ministers when trade ministers meet and even foreign ministers have their role when we all do our business uh in a in a much more regular intensive constructive manner I think that's hugely helpful to take in the relationship forward now if I can switch track and speak a little bit about how I see the landscape today in India we have uh this you know this annual budget exercise I'm sure you have your version of it as well and what the budget exercise does is it's it's like a public stock taking of the national economy and not just a I mean we call it budget but actually the budget has alongside it uh a kind of a an economic uh shall I say an economic strategy and a economic prognosis for a much longer period than just a year of which the which the budget covers so it could come as a packet the budget of course course corrects every year in for that larger picture now since we're just coming out of the parliament session last week of the of the after the presentation of the budget uh I would uh sort of underline to you today that in India we feel that we relatively speaking we have come out of the covet challenge uh quite strongly I mean there's a human cost all of us know that I think there's not a single family that I know which hasn't had some kind of covet loss and but having said that the covet period one we responded to it in a way in which it was fiscally sustainable in fact a lot of reforms were carried out during the under the covet stress there was a lot of creativity which also was implemented on scale on the field also because of the covet pressures and in many ways I think decisions which may have otherwise taken us much longer for example ramping up our health uh you know our the resources we devote to health I think a lot of these decisions really got fast forwarded so the sense today in India really is uh of a certain amount of economic confidence a confidence also in our ability to to manufacture to create to collaborate in many more areas we are targeting seven percent growth uh this year but we do expect it to improve uh in in the next five over the next five years and definitely we think we would stay in that seven to nine percent range uh at least for a decade decade and a half uh and uh you can in India today see that reflected in the investment climate uh in the both in the flow of FDI fii as well as in the Investments which the government itself is leading uh the the capital uh outlay in the budget this year is actually about a third more than it's ever been before uh now uh having sort of made that point that you're really looking at at a uh sort of bullish economic scenario in India there are a few aspects which I would like to keep at the end of the discussion because I I think it might be useful to dilate upon it at some length but if I were to today move back to our relationship I mentioned the investment climate because I think if there's one area in our relationship we need to look at more strongly that is really an encouraging more an investment sorry I think the actor would definitely is already having a a good impact on trade but if you know in a sense we have to walk on both legs trade and investment together because they are they are mutually reinforcing uh so for us when you know the CEO Forum meets and when the trade Minister comes in when the Prime Minister comes uh how do we actually uh encourage greater Investments that is very much a focus uh for for this person uh in our own relationship I think the the mobility migration aspect of it is is very important uh we've seen a very substantial uh movement of Indian talent to Australia uh we have roughly in the world roughly about a million students and Australia would is I think purely probably I think third or third probably or fourth in terms of the uh of the numbers but uh again I agree with you I I you know you said it shouldn't be thought of as a business you didn't use those words but that's what you meant and you spoke about the the you know the the trust side of it the responsibility side of it but I would like to also stress the Strategic side of it yeah because what we are going to see in the world we are already seeing in the world is there's today a great mismatch between the geographies of demand and the geographies of demographics so where the people need to be is not where the people are or whether demand is is not where the people are and the last year actually has seen a number of countries actually wake up to this possibility uh just over the last three months I've signed a migration Mobility agreement with Germany which actually has been a very conservative Society in terms of uh flow of people from outside and even more conservative partner Austria we have concluded an agreement for a certain set of professions with Japan uh it's it's been on hold because of covet for implementation reasons because we also have to teach them language with the UK with France with Denmark with Portugal so uh one part of the movement of students you know the education is something bigger than education it's actually about the talent and skills which is needed to sustain a global economy but there's the other part which today again we would like to focus on is something which uh prime minister albanesi in fact brought up in his first meeting with Prime Minister Modi when they met in Tokyo which is how do we expand in India the the ability to impart skills and education and we would very much welcome Australian universities in India to do that because having people move out physically we are actually not I'm we're talking hundred thousand people frankly that number is very small compared to what the global demand is so if you are really going to add a few zeros to that we need to really get our you know uh act together in India do it very differently and we can only do that if it is actually done as a global collaboration and that's why our new education policy uh in visages a regime which will allow uh in India for foreign universities to come in in some form uh uh my expectation is that there probably will be some further legislation on the subject and some regulations which would facilitate that but the the whole domain of skills and talent is something I think which is very Central to this relationship and for us it's not just about Indian students coming to Australia it's about India and Australia working together in India to produce uh you know more a more skilled more competent uh talent for the entire world uh connectivity is another subject I mean uh it's it's again uh uh part of growing a relationship is really having the ability to move uh we we have an open Skies agreement but it's very clear again that uh the the supply lacks well behind demand but of course the good news is that Air India has bought 470 planes so hopefully that should make a big difference to connecting India with the rest of the world uh prosperity in India is also something I would highlight and I I say this coming out of you know I've recently been to and this is completely coincidence to places where actually tourists go Fiji Cyprus priests all this was work okay I mean let's not but uh you know I I put it to you that just as we saw in other parts of Asia uh what we saw with Japan what we saw with Korea but southeast Asia China uh as there is greater prosperity and as the middle class grows uh you know middle class is a very broad term but in our own system today uh we would say somewhere between a quarter of India you know roughly give or take would be would qualify uh for what we would call middle class but we expect this to actually uh become something like six you know two-thirds of the country in the next 25 years and when you have that kind of growth of middle class and the the consumption patterns of the middle class and the aspirations of middle class I think it's it's something which uh any you know any producer of any goods and services which relate to middle class demand should be looking at and you know the the countries which which clearly are early movers here would draw a lot of benefit uh another subject of course which has been getting a lot of attention is climate action uh and again if if you want to see you know big things done on scale serious things done at scale uh India's in many ways the place to be uh a lot of the story of the last seven eight years has been about solar I think you're going to see a big spike in wind and obviously in hybrid energy uh or the but there is now uh I think a growing focus on green hydrogen green hydrogen green ammonia and again this is a global phenomena I think one of the unintended fallouts of the Ukraine conflict is a de-risking from fossil fuels uh so green hydrogen actually probably has got a great boost because of the uncertainties of how pipelines and production contracts have been leveraged now uh I just like to conclude by highlighting four four developments in India which I think today are very important to understand because they capture the change in a way one that we have you know we use this term make in India make make in India uh is a term uh which is really meant to highlight the importance of uh of setting up production of of collaborating with Indian companies it is not a Target it is collaborative you know we want our partners to come but we would like them to make in India because we believe we offer a lot of advantages there and uh the the make in India in many ways is today given a practical shape through uh in in many domains through what we call production linked incentives so a very very notable example is the decision by Apple over the last two years to shift a lot of their production uh to India but in different domains we really want Global manufacturing to look at India seriously the second is in a way and invented in India that you are going to see more products more services more Technologies which are going to come out of India and if I were to I mean one example was even during the covet the the fact that there was among the vaccines which came out was a vaccine which was invented well more than one vaccine which was invented in India but here if I were to pick an example I think you will get a really Deployable 5G technology coming out of India this year and suddenly I think given what I said about trust and transparency in the digital domain I think this is something which will be of great Global interest the third pertains to a long-standing problem we have a complaint which about our infrastructure and again if you come to India Today physically you can see the infrastructure position change I mean you travel in India I go to any Indian city there's some building going on there's you know there's there's a sort of an energy and a and a actually a uh it's like you know worker bees at it all the time and here the the change has been an integrated infrastructure policy now you might think that's not a big deal but for us frankly one of the reasons why we had not done well on infrastructure was it was done in a very siled manner so the railway guys did that stuff the roads did there's the power guys did that so today the idea that there's a kind of a master plan you can say of doing it in a in a Consolidated collaborative inter departmental interministry cross business way it's something we call gati Shakti and that's having it's it's actually making infrastructure uh building because uh you know these are uh these are some of the challenges are anybody who's lived in India will understand you know right of way for example getting getting the the land acquisition done on time these are the kind of hold UPS which we've long had and that's being addressed very effectively and lastly if there's a big change in India in the last three years it's the digitization of India and digitization on a scale and an intensity which is very difficult to communicate if you haven't seen it for yourself and again if I were to sort of give you a few shorthand descriptions during covet one of our you know we were one of the early countries to lockdown but we were one of the countries who locked down most comprehensively when we lock down we completely locked down and the challenge was how do you feed you know what happens to people in the informal economy uh people who went back to their homes during this period so it was it was a socio-economic challenge to some degree it was a political challenge and it was actually the time when the digital backbone was tested and we had these two programs uh one of giving a free food and for till the 31st of December last year beginning from May of 2020 we were actually delivering free food to a little more than 800 million people and 800 million people confident that it was actually going to them unlike earlier days it wasn't that it was getting siphoned off coming into the market middlemen were taking stuff the digital was actually ensuring an Integrity of delivery and transaction that would not have been possible equally on the financial side because we had encouraged people to open bank accounts sometimes bank accounts with no money in them but we were again during the same period putting in money into the bank accounts of 415 million people who were the lowest income in the country and if you ask me how did you get through covet I cannot overstate the importance of actually financially supporting people and feeding people and ensuring that this works on the ground but it's not just the crisis interventions which are a validation this has now become the basic governance mechanism but today to do uh social economic delivery so if you look we are we are trying to demonstrate that we can construct a social a comprehensive social welfare system even at our scale of income and our scale of income is two thousand dollars per capita and we can do that really by you know really cutting the overheads making sure that the in a in a sense that the programs are very targeted and therefore very very efficient so if you look at most of our of our delivery programs today uh the the social programs we have really in the last four years been able to get about 500 million people covered by Health schemes about the same number covered by pension skills uh the you know there was a there was a a program to replace firewood with cooking gas and the cooking gas initial lot of cooking gas you get free of cost now that program was as big as 80 million people we have a housing program a housing program we've already delivered 30 million houses and at five people a family in India that means 150 million people have been covered so I'm giving you these numbers because it actually tells you the scale which digital backbone makes possible we couldn't have done this 10 years ago because we didn't have that backbone and we didn't have the Strategic understanding to to activate and utilize that backbone and you can see this in the lifestyle of people as well I mean today if you look at education uh so much of it today is is digital look at shopping I mean we have in fact if you look at our uh our cashless transactions the UPI I think we record the largest number of cash test transactions in the world so there's been a kind of a technology leapfrogging in the in the psyche of people and that's been actually a very very uh big uh difference and it's having you know as a political pers I can tell you you know when you go to your constituency you go to other constituencies your company this is really what is making a difference that uh when you know there are people who and the nice thing about it this is actually absolutely faceless so it relieves the politician of any charge of favoring you know one group or one Community or one region against the other I mean you you actually can go in there completely object objective utterly impartial totally technology data driven and that's you know that's an enormous boom so these were some of the you know thoughts which I thought you know I I should share with you uh the you know my senses we today clearly got a strong political Tailwind uh the challenge in any relationship you know different relationships work differently sometimes business gets a bit ahead sometimes you're kind of I would say socially or technologically driven uh when I look at the quad each one of the relationships has moved with a with a different aspect of it leading but I would say this for the political side I mean with the degree of bested Interest here that we've actually LED so far and we have created an environment today where I think the business side the economic side the investment side the technology side can come in much more strongly and that's really the phase today that we need to be working at so once again really thank you for your attention [Applause] [Music]

strategy research and executive I actually live in Tokyo now and I work remotely and I can get away with jeans and tracksuit pants and then a suit jacket which I throw on for meetings and it's been a very long time since I've been at an event like this so I have to say this is enormous step up for me in presentation and I'm taking this big step mostly because I like ORF so much quite frankly and especially Samir and his team they're a delight to work with very very creative and strategic more so probably than any other Think Tank I can think of around the world and I've certainly met a lot of think tanks which I think makes ORF a really fantastic asset for both India and the indo-pacific more broadly and very few countries have such an influential Think Tank our session today will examine the strengthening Partnerships in a time of geopolitical and techno technological competition it's a great topic it's a broad topic uh geopolitics will almost certainly come out in every question but I will try to steer us to discussions about India's growth into becoming a digital and Tech and science Powerhouse and that really has been the theme of so many of our ministerial speeches today we had two this morning at the business brunch and the two we've witnessed this afternoon and before I introduce our three esteemed panelists here let me say that this technology discussion is very important for us at aspie I see aspie as a leading indo-pacific Think Tank not just on defense and National Security now but also on technology and this technology piece will only become more important for us across this year especially because of the Sydney dialogue in April 4th and 5th and second in a fortnight we're launching a very large technology project actually at a small event at the recenter dialogue in New Delhi which is a website tracking countries universities and companies across 44 Technologies and I wanted to raise it because it will show that India performs incredibly well even better than we thought especially in the fields of Advanced Materials and Manufacturing AI Computing communication nation's energy and environmental texts we've already heard a lot about today critical minerals and also well in the defense and space categories of advanced Aircraft engineers hypersonics and drones so a lot of interesting data there one key Institute that shines through this global data set is the Indian Institutes of technology and it's a key organization producing a lot of India's most high quality and high impact Science and Technology research and you see them across the website it's quite fascinating but I wanted to point out this performance because unlike other large countries it's very unique very different to China's and the United States both performance and trajectory in these external affairs minister talked at the business Branch this morning about India's efforts to retain more of its Digital Science and Technology talent and of the hope that Australian universities will consider opening campuses in India and our upcoming research will show that India contributes huge portions of its domestic Talent across all sectors including to Australia to Europe and especially to the United States but despite This Global brain drain India still performs in a top three or four country and is clearly on an upwards trajectory and this perfectly I think ties back into our panel discussion we're about to kick off because the indo-pacific is quite easily the world's Center of technological innovation and strategic competition and it's worth us all thinking about these Global strategic shifts that are already in play now how that balance of skills of talent of r d technology and changes in Supply chains will impact us over the coming years particularly as China too ramps up enormously in this space so with that let me get to to the reason we're here our panelists a shock Malek who has just been a week with us at aspie is immediately to my right here in Canberra he's now an aspie non-resident senior fellow full-time is a partner in India chair at the Asia group a strategic advisory firm in Washington DC with over 30 years of experience working across Indian government media and think tanks previously as a policy advisor additional secretary in India's Ministry of external Affairs Dr Michael Green over there on the side is Chief Executive Officer of the United States Center at the University of Sydney saw a talent gain for us in Australia Dr Green was previously a senior vice president for Asia Japan chair and Henry a Kissinger chair at the center for strategic and international studies and before that was on the National Security Council from 2001 to five where you covered a range of countries and themes with a focus on Asia and in the middle here is my colleague BEC shrimpton aspie director responsible for convening the Sydney dialogue Premier policy Summit for critical emerging cyber and space Technologies she has the biggest the busiest job in aspie it's quite incredible and over 20 years experience and policy and operational roles primarily in the Department of Defense and also dfat how I'm going to run this panel because it's quite tight for time because I have a couple questions each for you and then we'll go to the floor hopefully for another few questions I'm going to put out two questions to you at the same time you can answer both or one it's totally up to you play to your strengths and passions and I will give you prompts so that you don't have to remember them word for word and a shock because you've traveled the furthest you can go first so number one question is over the last decade in particular Australia and India have shown that cooperation is possible beyond cultural ties and Cricket with a growing strategic convergence across sectors that have been historically quite complex at times economics and trade security defense and increasingly technology so the question is what is the limit for our cooperation for example is a security treaty hard to Envision where could we go go in areas like technology and space so that's one that's that's that's out there for you number two is how do we leverage a closer partnership to drive influence in the indo-pacific for example with a more ambitious agenda in the quad or by pursuing shared interest in larger multilateral settings or in Southeast Asia in the Pacific so first question limits for Corporation second question on partnership leveraging how to do that better and where over to your shock thank you thank you very much and thank you aspiratory for inviting me here you haven't asked two questions you've asked me for a PhD thesis which I obviously cannot sum up I think the limits to to the partnership in our imagination quite frankly uh but if I were to to make that more granular I think the areas we'd like we should focus on is very broadly Security in the broadest Institute because Security today is not just about gun boats and ships which is also the area of course traditional security certainly matters but in our parts of the world which is so consequential to the global economy to our shared Prosperity uh climate change Tech Supply chains technology uh the awesome the osmosis between traditional and non-traditional security preparing for the next pandemic and preparing for the next biological attack overlap tremendously in all of these areas we have to recognize and we are recognizing that something the efficient that is begins in the Indian part of the indo-pacific is going to be felt in the Pacific part of the Hindu Pacific it does what starts near Sydney ends up near Chennai and vice versa as Minister jayashankar said this entails both Australia and India pooling our strengths uh and working to help each other in our sub-regions so what happens in the Pacific island is consequential to me in India and what happens in the Indian Ocean in Sri Lanka Myanmar is consequential to you in Australia quite frankly it's that imagination that that has to be reinforced and re-emphasized Time After Time year after year through multiple transitions in government here and there which is really what this issue is about thank you a shock Mike I might skip to you sorry back we'll come back to you to go next um thank you thanks Justin for inviting me congratulations to aspion ORF on this inaugural dialogue everything that you said about ORF is true they have a pretty strong presence in Washington now aspie does people are really worried about this India Australia pinch that's coming but it would be a good thing um so my sense is that the Indie Australia relationship like the quad is on a steady upward trajectory that will continue um uh for at least a decade um and um I say that because I think the most important variable there's a very rich agenda that both ministers talked about for cooperation necessary cooperation but the most important variable that determines how closely Australia or the us or Japan work with India is frankly um a country that starts with sea to the north of us and I'm American and I'm not talking about Canada um that that neither Minister mentioned once it always amazes me in Washington you go to something like this and if you counted how many times China was said you'd get to 50 or 100 times it was really quite fascinating to me still is six months later how little China is mentioned explicitly but that's the driver and as I've I was in the White House on on boxing day um 2000 uh of four when the Indian Ocean tsunami happened and we stood up the quad very quickly in part because it was Christmas break and most of the US government was gone which was wonderful but also because there was a foundational understanding that of course U.S Japan Australia has treaty allies but India also had a fundamental role in providing public goods for this region and unstated that the U.S Australia and Japan had a fundamental interest in India being a geopolitical player um but it's hard at that time I also sat across from then additional secretary jaishanker for the negotiations on our nuclear agreement which was really hard the uranium issue is going to be hard and governments do these hard things not just because they're opportunities but because they're scared because there's an urgency I think a lot of that comes from what we've seen with China and at various points in the history of Australia India relations and the quad there were governments in Australia and the U.S sometimes in Japan that assumed the future of this region depended on a bipolar condominium or arrangement with China that was quite popular in 2009-10 and in in the US and Australia and um the quad failed now our surveys at uh you know study center service at csis show pretty clearly that Americans and Australians and Japanese think that to deal with China cooperate work together but to deal with the China we see today highest priority is working with allies and partners so we're now in a world where Xi Jinping is not going to change course maybe tone maybe tactics and so I think Australia is going to be motivated to do some of the hard things necessary to um to give India capacity because ultimately the alignment is important but what really is important for stability in this region is that India continues to be a net exporter of security and Welfare and that's not just about alignment it's also about capacity and and which is why we did the nuclear deal why I think the uranium export thing is important why the U.S agreement recently with India and Technology development is important I think that's the game it's that's what really motivates us to do some of the hard things because India um sorry Ashok but you know while you were in MEA India India can be hard um Beck let's come to you so either limits for Corporation partnership leveraging how do we do that better and where and if we can spark your infectious passion for topics like space technology and deterrence that would make you very happy not difficult to spark those at all I have to say uh look I think two really interesting and complementary answers from the from the previous two speakers so um you know I I agree with with both here there are real external factors that are that are driving this partnership as well as internal uh factors in both countries and that's really important to understand the push factors the pool factors you know it's it's complex but um but it is a range of things that are happening here um I love the word imagination and I don't think we use it enough and and I do think it's a challenge I really do um you know policy making what makes a good partnership what what what makes for the kind of partnership that that increases security stability um you know it is words like trust agility and I think most importantly understanding and awareness so um look at there's absolutely no doubt that the Common Ground between our countries is expanding that our external outlooks are increasingly aligned so this really does set a path for um you know a great growth in the relationship nobody wants to use the term no limits Partnerships right now so I certainly won't but I do think that the Caps are really probably going to be self-imposed if if they are to the extent that they exist thank you for the question on Space because I think this domain like almost no other really can help illustrate the potential of this relationship it talks to deep complementarities in research and development capability in that industrial capability in the challenge that came from the question thank you so much for it it was great I thought about Australia's lack of ability to scale it's not that we don't have brilliant innovators and it's not that we can't produce use the very best bleeding edge capability but we often cannot scale so how do we bring these things together well you know space as a domain you know great opportunity for collaboration but it also offers so many opportunities to solve big problems here on Earth climate ocean monitoring Earth observation Communications um we just do not I don't think our publics are yet aware enough of just how much our everyday lives rely on space so I think it's one that makes sense at the social level at the individual level at the economic level at the Strategic level and most definitely makes sense at a national security level fantastic now I'm gonna I'm gonna ask another thesis style question uh to the panel and then because we're so tired on time I might actually go straight to the floor for a couple questions so if you want to have a if you want to put out a question please think of them now uh Mike let's start with you as our token American as we bring in the US uh the indo-pacific faces an inherent contradiction involving many countries in the region who often don't want bipolar U.S China competition I just want to make make a note that I've mentioned China a few times now um but who also largely want and a continued strong U.S engagement in the region how can countries like Australia and India work together with other key partners and allies like us and Japan and others to help ensure Regional prosperity and security but I think also help to provide and stimulate greater confidence and Trust in that Regional Prosperity uh and security well if you think about it um Australia and India together have the largest population in the world so the up opportunities are Limitless now um so um you know one of the most fundamental transformations in American strategic thinking over the last five years has been a recognition of something many of us were advocating that this is a multi-polar region um and as Dr jaishanker said I think quite accurately that relative U.S power is insufficient to maintain a stable equilibrium and so we need allies and partners our surveys show that Americans who always support alliance with Australia and Japan Now supported for a different reason which is they think we need Australia and Japan for our security and there is a greater willingness um to to to do things like August or the technology agreement with India despite our bureaucratic obstacles which are well known um so the middle power cooperation I think is fundamentally in U.S interests and the more India and Australia Australia Japan India Japan developed relations the better it is for the US in terms of maintaining a an equilibrium and getting away from beijing's preferred narrative that it is a bipolar region you know the great new model of great power relations that the shinjin douglasi with the US and China will settle things in the smaller parows will live with it that's not in our interests so uh this um really um Dynamic relationship between India and Australia is important so it's the quad um what could what could countries do together um very quickly I think um uh Dr jashank are sort of sort of brushed on this but I think the quad countries in particular could do a much better job monitoring foreign interference and resilience across this region um I think we could do more on climate mitigation um the indo-pacific command has a fantastic model you can get on their website where they predict the impacts of climate change in places like Bangladesh and Myanmar they have to because they're deploying every year and they've now made it publicly available so you know jointly Indie Australia the quad could be looking at working for strategies for climate mitigation adaption consequence management um I think we are entering an era where a standing Joint Task Force for the quad is is a realistic proposition maybe headquartered in your Coast cup with a rotating um headquarters at sea between the Canberra or the Blue Ridge or an Indian carrier so there's a lot we could do I just did and um the New York university did this fascinating Study last year it was on CNBC they did a documentary you can find it where they interviewed about 100 people who worked on the quad from all four countries then out of that they created this complicated quantitative model to predict what would happen to the quad and it was growth including all the things I just mentioned um so lots of potential fascinating do either of you want to come in on that question or else I might ask both of you a different one any strong thoughts you want to bite into there you know I I just want to add something about the court I think one of the quads big strengths is that the quad is Loosely defined and ambiguous and this ambiguity uh uh frankly sometimes confounds quad member countries and their citizens it also confounds uh those on the other side which is which is the strength actually uh quad was always meant to be agile and Nimble not a building with lots of civil servants going in from nine to five quad is not always about all four countries coming together and all four bureaucracies somehow miraculously working together because that can be complicated what is about principles what is about evangelizing court principles whether alone singly or bilaterally it's about India and Australia working with Indonesia it's about India and Australia working in the Pacific Islands it's about India and Australia working in let's say Sri Lanka not necessarily but all four countries having to work together so I think the big strength of court that is that it can if you adhere to its its principles in a sense and its values which is which is transparency which is uh uh Market determined principles for projects and so on it can be defined in just about any way and it may long remain that because uh as you said countries in the region don't really want to choose uh this is really a battle for the hearts and minds of those smaller countries which are being forced to make a choice and don't want to make a choice and what and as I said quote countries need to go there with a positive presenter this is what we have this is what we offer not this is what we are not yeah and it does feel like the covid-19 pandemic supercharge that sort of external facing role for the quad Beck I'm gonna throw you a very different question uh actually um and just a bit of a side step in topics and then we'll go to the floor um I want to know from you how you think the Russian invasion of Ukraine has impacted the region as it reevaluates its strategic vulnerabilities yeah it's um it's a it's a really good question it's a timely question and it's an important question um look I think it it for many of us underlined what we we knew in our guts and a lot of the rhetoric the policy rhetoric um paid heed to this is we live in a truly globalized World conflict can happen anywhere in the world and when and if it does it has absolutely Global implications so you cannot you cannot contain conflict um you know the world is interconnected and and there's no peeling that back um easily I think what Ukraine really brought into sharp relief was the unthinkable Canon does happen so that one percent sort of like you know probability but catastrophic consequence event that you know we we like to sort of look at and think about it as a risk but putting that put in that nice little corner and not actually treat um we need to start treating it um and I think that that's really brought um to the front of the consciousness of many of the countries in this region you know the nature of the various actors uh you know and how how they exercise power um you know what is the difference between actors and I think what is what is interesting to think about from a from a regional country's perspective is um when you look at this region um do we see a Russia um certainly not in India I wouldn't have thought um certainly not in Japan certainly I hope not in Australia um but yeah we we see something that looks a little bit like um you know a Russia in in Europe and that's deeply deeply frightening so I mean what's the right response to that um it is collaboration it's not panic but it is increased urgency in thinking about all of the you know the things that have been revealed um as dependencies and you know it does cause us to rethink uh the way that we have the way that we have meshed and the way that we have created dependence um that said I think the other really interesting thing and to bring it back to technology a little bit um I think that we were starting to think that technology was going to make war kind of clean and a little bit less messy and a little bit less catastrophic and if if Ukraine has shown us several things it's one technology really really does matter the private sector really does matter and they're going to be in there on the ground sometimes before nation states are but they're not going to make wall cleaner the fundamentals of War still exist and they come back to humans and they come back to Bloodshed and attrition and things like industrial capability stockpile and all these sorts of things that we haven't thought about for a very long time so that is driving entirely different conversations in this region than were happening two to three years ago I think that's a good thing but I think again we need to be measured and deliberate and calm um and go back to these principles of what is a good partnership what is a good relationship whether it's strategic economic industrial technological all right let's go to the floor I'm going to ask I'm going to take maybe three questions uh from this at the same time if people are being shy I have an additional question I'd love to throw to our panelists do we have any hands up for questions from the floor uh Ian Hall hi so Ian Hall from Griffith Azure Institute in Brisbane so questions to the whole panel but maybe specifically to Mike Green um look for understandable reasons the US government and U.S firms are concerned concerned about their intellectual property but if we're going to manage all the challenges in this region we're going to have to share some of that intellectual property so what work still needs to be done particularly in Congress to loosen some of the controls that exist uh in order that we can all collectively deal with some of the challenges in the region thank you do we have any more from the floor yep okay it might take I might take all of them and then we'll call it a close sure thanks Daniel uh Patty Yates from the Asia Foundation uh someone who spends a fair bit of time on Development Corporation I've been surprised how often it's actually come up um today um and the new government has obviously gotten new development development policy but also the defense capability review going on be interested across the different arms of sort of statecraft where do you think the new government needs to prioritize and sort of supercharge things when it comes to the relationship with India um hi I'm Amit Mehta and I represent the Australian corporate treasury Association in Queensland where the chair of that so I come from a corporate background it's about risk and actually just a few days ago I watched a video with Samir in it and with my business school Professor from IMD and they said the risks identified in 2019 at Davos are the same as they were done in 2023. now when you are a corporate and you're trying to plan you're making Investments which is necessary for economic growth how do we advise Chief Executives on corporates to make investments and to start feeling more secure about this extremely volatile world where we don't know what's going to happen next fantastic and Gisela we might come down or ban whoever's closest to Michaela down here as well for a fourth and final question hello are my questions on cyber security some of the most sophisticated the most complicated threat actors that we face as state backs threat actors so can I ask you to reflect on how do we need to involve our our governance our policies and our capabilities in that context does that require a radical rethink and what do we think especially if we're thinking about emerging Tech about the quantum race and what that will mean in that sector okay that's a very um diverse range of questions Mike let's go to you first because you also got a specific one on IP so the IP question is pretty fundamentally and I'm glad you raised it I I don't think the problems in the U.S private sector um you know a company like Google or Microsoft or Boeing sees a global Marketplace and Global Innovation they're all being forced um to de-risk from China but even you know traditional sort of national security companies like Lockheed Martin are building things like the F-16 and F-35 globally with Global Partners the problems in the in the US government and the Congress and um that you you know there's a survey show that um the American people and the Australian people um want less Reliance on China trust Japanese-American Australian technology um our survey shows that Americans and Australians would be willing to pay about 400 more for an iPhone if they were told it was not made in China which is kind of an interesting test now when they go to the store I I'm not sure that would still be true but at least in theory um so the public sort of gets it the the problem we have two problems in terms of U.S government policy one is that the export control regime that covers thing things like the much-loved itar that covers Tech transfer to Australia um was was built for the 1960s 70s and 80s um and there are parts of the US government particularly the state department that only get rewarded for not making mistakes not for actually building Allied capabilities and um they are fighting a valiant rear guard action and I think they're going to get rolled eventually not fast enough to satisfy defense and dfat but that's the trend the other problem though is um because frankly of the China Challenge um now even Republicans you know Reagan Republicans are talking about industrial policy and there's no discipline in the Congress on rent seeking and so you have a White House strategy year ago that says we're going to collaborate with allies on technology competition development and then two paragraphs later we're going to emphasize buy American and the IRAs an example so this isn't as our Chinese friends like to say this is a an inherent contradiction and will have to be resolved and I'm going to be as obnoxious as possible um to try to get there I think um uh Dr Jay shanker's observation about the American Congress and public and government knowing we need allies is going to drive this in the right direction and I hope Australia's obnoxious too on Cyber um it's it's you know there's a lot that can be said about cyber to me the part that's most interesting and sort of under appreciated right now in terms of um cyber as an issue and cyber security is an issue with with very strong allies like Australia Japan with new partners like India the challenge is that in an escalation scenario for Taiwan or the South China Sea um particularly after Ukraine I would not predict that the central military Commission in Beijing says I have an idea let's put guys on ships and land in kyoshong invade they're going to look for ways to hit the seams um between you know kinetic and non-kinetic and if the fact is we're already at Cyber War particularly Taiwan it's going on all the time so that's going to be the challenge and our capabilities even between the US and Australia are not um at the same level our understanding of escalation control deterrence compellence counterforce is not aligned um and really not with India um not that India would be into Taiwan contingency but but as these Partnerships grow I think we really have to um focus on Cyber as a strategic issue conceptually in terms of capabilities and and in all of government all of society problem um so lots of work for your University for aspie for my center for csis so cyber is a gift that we'll keep on giving Beck will go to you and then we'll finish uh with a Shockers traveled the furthest okay we'll do a couple minutes each just so that we don't eat into the next panel at all sure sure um look I don't think I need to say much more than Tech transfer Mike and I know that we are in violent agreement on this one um a lot needs to happen but we're banging the drum on the DSR and what that might mean for Australia India I mean I'm what I'm looking for here is you know is is a balanced and a calibrated approach we do a lot of really good work already but we might need to sort of up the ante in some of the traditional ways that we cooperate but let's have a you know a really good think about where the new technologies the critical and emerging Technologies are taking us and where we have some really respective and complementary skills I think uh nowhere again you would expect me to say this from my last answer but I would not focus um well I would not consider it to be a higher priority than than space and Maritime um equal equal High priorities lots of potential and again that mix of you know traditional platforms and traditional capability with with how we think about new technologies and not on their own also how we mix these these newer Technologies with existing platforms um and human capability right so human capability and the ability to work together as uh as forces should be should be front and center um the risk question is is excellent and I think the risk industry is going in the same direction as as the conversation in deterrence has been for probably the last decade and a half um it is it needs to be far more integrated uh it is far more complex it doesn't really fit into a nice Matrix anymore you've got political risk commercial risk security risk so you do need a far more full spectrum or integrated approach to risk and that's that's thinking about it differently that's talking to people who like to put things in buckets about taking them out of their buckets and thinking about things more holistically and Michaela absolutely brilliant question state-backed threats but where is all the Innovation and the capability or 95 of it happening commercial sector Civil Society universities not not necessarily in things that are controlled by the state certainly not in Liberal Democratic countries so my short answer to you which is not doing enough um you know giving enough Merit to your question is we need to work much more closely together across the themes and it's not just National scenes but it is a sense between government between industry and Civil Society itself within countries and between them but governments can't solve this industry won't solve this and Civil Society is trying very hard to make a difference and needs to be part of the conversation it's one of the things that we'll do at Sydney dialogue thank you beggar shop before you start I'm just going to throw one more question out for you because you're going to finish us off here in addition to what we already have from the floor I would love to know from you even if it's a one minute answer what does an ideal Australia or India relationship look like in 10 years to you so you've got a couple okay pick from there I'll answer three questions one the the mechanics of how we can tackle cyber security problems which of course this is dynamic it's kinetic it will keep changing but one mechanism India has used the the government has used in terms of setting up digital infrastructure or Telecom infrastructure of products in India is a a list a list of trusted sources and within trusted sources the list of trusted products and now when it comes to data localization looking at trusted geographies geography is where we'd be willing to store our data and geographies where we would not be able to store our data this is aimed of course at primarily the country which sounds like Canada but uh this this trust as a as a parameter of cyber security or increasing cyber security challenges is going to be very very important between countries and companies uh talking of risk as someone who works in the area of giving corporates corporations advise on risk all I can say is people need to be willing to pay for that risk mitigation because risk investigation is not cheap we are all suffering from either sourcing concentration or frankly Market concentration which is Australia's big problem uh if you need to to diversify from that it is going to be expensive it's going to be expensive for companies and countries and uh we need to start getting used to a world which is more expensive but less risky and finally uh wherever I see this relationship in 10 years in the government in an Ideal World in an ideal world uh it would be look I'll get the example of the India U.S relationship which is about 10 or 20 15 years ahead of the University relationship it the modern indo-us relationship goes back about 25 years uh it's now survived Clinton uh Bush Obama Trump Biden five very different people and it's grown with each of them but let me tell you at each transition we were worried is Bush going to be interested in us is Trump going to be interested in in us okay and so on and so forth okay but Biden is he going to be interested in new Pacific he was and he took it up ah with India and Australia we have frankly one third of the journey we've only done about eight or ten years and this is the first major transition we're experiencing so far it's gone splendidly but there will be future transitions here and in India so in in an Ideal World in 10 years this relationship would be transition agnostic yeah it's still a work in progress I like that transition agnostic that is a perfect place to end and I was told by colleagues I wouldn't get uh dinner or a glass of wine if I went one minute over uh 45 past and we're at 44 past so I want my meal and a glass of wine soon I'm very hungry thank you so much to our panelists it was delightful to be able to um share this panel I would like everyone to try to stay where they are there'll be two minutes before our next panel so if you need to go to the bathroom please do but don't go too far it's going to be a very quick transition to our next panel on global Corporation priorities for the G20 at indo-pacific leadership let's end by giving our panelists Round of Applause thank you

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/orfonline",1,I'm delighted to welcome you all back to this pre-dinner session where we are honored to have a ministerial address by Ambassador Hardeep Puri someone who is a multilateralist someone who has worked at the highest International offices someone who has served as the head of the UNSC when he was representing India someone who's worked on trade an author a thinker and now someone who's interested interested with the task of managing one of the most interesting sectors something we really touched during the day so we spoke on energy we spoke on energy security we have a task force that is working on that as well so he is entrusted with the charge with the charge of India's energy security and energy needs as the minister of petroleum and natural gas and of course he's also the minister for urban Affairs something we spoke about today as well something critical to sustainable development and climate change Mr Puri brings a wealth of experience in these sectors obviously but as a Ambassador and as a diplomat in his previous life he has traversed the world from South America to Across The Globe and he brings up understanding of world affairs that is very unique and we are truly privileged sir that you have agreed to speak to us this evening and may now request you to arrest us thank you very much and good evening to all of you I have known Samir perhaps longer than most of you um he has a certain way of getting things done which means that um uh he is able to exercise his margin of persuasion and I kept protesting that I have five different functions and five different parts of the city but you know I left me no choice but at the end of the day I'm delighted to be here I'm saying all this only because I want to apologize for my delayed arrival uh why do I think and that's something I want to speak to you about why is the Indian G20 presidency a sui generous one one of a kind and I want to ask that question myself and I want to respond to it in order to provoke a discussion one I think that many of us tend to take the G20 as a given as something that's been around that is not the case always the G20 arose and was established when the world economy was in a crisis following the world economic crisis in 2008 or thereabouts the crisis itself emanated from The subprime Lending sector of the U.S real estate market but given the High degree of integration of the global economy in some parts the contagion spread very quickly why am I saying that because I recall that when the crisis was upon us all the established agencies which should have had the intellectual heft to address that crisis were if I may submit and I hope I see a lot of friends around me and I hope they don't take it a miss their respective organizations whether they were working for the fund the bank the WTO I'm not saying it because I saw harshia but otherwise they were frankly at a loss as to how to address the crisis and as happens ever so often when you don't know what to do then your response is large and comprehensive so the G20 used to meet at Finance Minister's level I think that meeting thereabouts was in Sao Paulo and they decided let's take this group and elevated to head of state head of government level and thus was born the G20 the G20 was born in a crisis situation and I think it goes to the strength of the G20 that the G20 certainly at the London Summit which was I think 2010 it was able to address the crisis and within perhaps the response time should have been shorter but it was able to calm issues down and the world felt safer as a result of the g20's action now my submission to you is that the next Crisis after that one is the one that we are facing today so this G20 presidency is essentially in terms of the core the kernel very different from the other G20 presidencies because India assumes the mantle its presidency at a time when there is genuinely a crisis what do I describe as a crisis I'm not trying to dramatize but we are facing at least three multiple at least three that I know of crises one all relating to three F's food fertilizer and fuel you could have a separate session devoted to each one of those about the energy crisis about fuel I know a little bit and I'm going to share of my some thoughts with you is India willing to address that crisis and my submission to use frontally and I don't say this because during the course of the pandemic you had India producing what 220 crore doses of vaccines which were distributed free not only within the country but outside I think our credentials as a responsible Global citizen were also underlined in that process most G20 presidencies tend to look at the membership of the G20 and invite a few special guests but this G20 presidency is doing something very different and before I come and pay a compliment to my friend sujan and Samir and all of you who are associated with TT 20. I was only about an hour ago I was addressing something called the voice of the global South but this is a G20 initiative which The Honorable prime minister conceptualized addressed and then several of us did independent session the Finance Minister I think the environment Minister and others and I did the energy session who were the participants overall I don't know how many there will be I can tell you in my group there were about 12 or 13 ministers Deputy Prime Minister one country energy Minister these are not the countries which are members of G20 but have a very important role to play so the horizontal spread in terms of participation is very different in this G20 from others so I could go on telling you how this G20 presidency is different but I want to come back to where you guys fit in look the International System although I'd rather let me use the word multilateral system was again conceived in moments of crisis when the San Francisco Conference took place in 1945 the world was still at War and it was that feeling of being embattled and being in a crisis which I think resulted in new institutions being born am I saying to you that absent the crisis it would have taken longer you bet that's what I'm saying try and put any today the U.N has 193 members take half of them put them in a room and tell them to negotiate they will negotiate till the cows come home and probably if you get 190 intelligent people sitting in a room the sum total of their individual intelligence put together will be an incomprehensible and an odd a document which very few people will understand but when you have a crisis that crisis has the imperative built into it of producing the result that is required that's a submission I'm making to you the multilateral system which was born in 1945 if you look at the U.N Charter it has two parts essentially one is it is a if you might call it a contract between sovereign states but I think an equally important and in today's day a far more important aspect is the second part We the People now what is we the people I think it is Civil Society non-governmental organizations and think tanks and if you have the power of the value the strength of ideas and you are in a position to Marshal those ideas and thoughts in order to address the challenges that you face and what are the challenges I think the challenges are known I'm not going to the three crisis points fuel fertilizer and fuel I'm not going to them but look at the other challenges climate basic architecture of the multilateral system as it exists do I have your permission to be a little direct and blunt when the United Nations was born there were two competing philosophies that went into its design today there are many pillars one pillar is peace and security the other pillar if I may for want of a better thing is development and a lot of other some fantastic workers done by the multilateral system some of it by the multilateral system directly some by association with the multilateral system Universal Declaration of Human Rights the sustainable development goals much better than the Millennium development goals and today the overall narrative is going in that direction but let's say the pry one of the primary purposes of the United Nations is peace and security what is the design of that architecture which deals with peace and security it is to take the relic of the second world war where the operating philosophy was To the victor belong the spoils and you created a security Council of five members which essentially has a veto on this now the cynic amongst you might ask why is the security Council so important I'd be ready to dismiss the security Council but there is a ground reality out there the Security Council is the only the only authorized and designated entity in the global system which has the authority to make a determination on whether there exists a threat to peace and security the very important statement which we lose sight of in the absence of that determination being exercised by the security Council any number of countries most likely the ones who have dominant political and economic power would just get up and say I think there is a threat to peace and security and I will take counter measures but the whole idea was to have a multilateral sanctity bordering on something much more Noble so that those determinations are not made in a casual manner and that Authority that designation on what constitutes a threat to peace and security also carries with it a concomitant power to authorize counter measures under chapters seven and eight of the charter now the use of force this is what it's all about is not mentioned in a blunt manner you talk about countermeasures in a way I think that's very important thing now wind back look at the number of times the veto has been exercised by the security Council and make an analysis clinically as a think tank how many times was the use of veto Justified I am one of those who say that in certain circumstances The veto is Justified and let me explain why to you number one if you apprehend or you fear that you are going to be faced with a situation where a mass atrocity is likely to be committed and by mass atrocity I mean all of them genocide ethnic cleansing war crimes and crimes against humanity I think the International Community should step in and take such measures as are necessary to prevent that kind of atrocity being committed but putting those extreme conditions aside look at the way this whole thing has evolved I am not going to get into a political judgmental game here all I can tell you is we would not be in the mess that we are in today I'm not talking about today as in 13 January 2023 but I'd say go back five ten years the fact is you have a security Council which is paralyzed and the minute a permanent member of the security Council ends up being directly or indirectly involved you can't get anything through the security Council so your peace and security track is effectively a non-starter given these situations so if you have to really contribute to the design of a and I'm not coming at this from the Indian advantage that you know reform the security Council India deserves to be a permanent member I'm too self-assured and arrogant to tell you whether the UN or anybody wants it or not that India will be a permanent member not because this is going to be reformed but you know either the system breakdown and countries which can do the heavy lifting will have to do it whether it is disaster relief or it is responses to health pandemics you don't be don't need to be a permanent member of the security Council do we do that you do it in your own right because you have a national system and Ethos which will make you do it this is where you guys come in I think I see friends from large number of countries in all our countries no matter what our political system they value and the force of ideas is exceptionally strong but I think you have a great opportunity here to discuss coalesce amongst yourselves and I'm only giving you the political peace and security Dimension I could speak equally with equal degree of passion on the world trading system what was the World Trading System designed for in Havana you were looking at the potential of setting up an International Trade Organization which would be Universal what did you end up with doing because the Havana Charter was not ratified except for chapter four I think harsh will correct me with deals with trade and tariffs and Etc that became the interim committee for the International Trade Organization icito which became the gat now when you converted the guide into the WTO simple question I want to ask how far is that system embodied in the WTO today able to address the challenges of today when the pandemic took place what did any of them do I'm not talking about the specialized agencies of the UN I'm not talking about the fund Bank Etc everybody had a theory but somebody had to step up move from there to climate move from there to any of the other major challenges so I'm going to conclude by a very simple submission to you that the multilateral system which was created in 1945 in the form of the UN the fund the bank get subsequently the WTO and all that goes with it is desperately trying crying out for reform and that's not the reform of individual institutions that is the larger issue of reforming the multilateral system and I frankly can't think of anyone better to start addressing those questions than a group of international think tanks brought together under the G20 now I have partly flattered you that was in response to this Sameer saying nice things about me but I've also hopefully provoked you I don't know how much time we have we have a little time so if you want to have a question and answer or exchange uh yeah we can sit there thank you very much thank you very much [Applause] so good so this is the time for you to ask questions to the minister um of course uh we would like to hear about as the energy Minister as a petroleum a natural dance Minister what is your prognosis and how do you see the next years play out well I can again be very very candidate with you the global energy challenges are on us for a variety of reasons hiring people forgot most people in policy making roles that in order to navigate through the pandemic most economies certainly the successful larger economies put in trillions of dollars through stimul stimulus packages into the economies these were inflationary to say the least if you add high oil prices to that then that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy it's no longer inflationary then you're looking at the Big R what are you looking at in at the globe today you are looking at the Big R there are some bright spots the United States which had which is a 20 plus trillion dollar economy uh it had quarter on quarter negative growth but it's otherwise resilient it's looking good parts of Europe I I wish I could characterize parts of Europe with the same degree of um uh confidence but I can't and you know why uh if you look at the developing world you have India India will grow at six percent Plus close to six and a half percent even more but then again it's an isolated case most others are looking at real challenges I mean the challenges of food fertilizer and I just mentioned a little bit about fuel let me tell you about fuel it's very simple the globe consumes the world consumes 100 million barrels a day those who produce um are the major producers of crude will tell you they don't determine the price don't take them seriously they determine the quantity they release so that in turn determines the price if there's a 1 million Barrel shortfall the price will go north from 70 to 80 will go to somewhere else and if you think that you are you have access to a superior form of um understanding of the global economy with Venezuela under sanctions of some form Iran not being able to release its oil and if you want to put Russia under a price cap or something that takes three of the largest suppliers off now it's very simple if everybody stop buying from let's say Russia hypothetically and starts buying only from those who have oil in the market you're not looking at 120 you're looking at 250 so that's the reality now that's why there is a complete mismatch between those who talk about climate change and those who are in the real world who have to navigate energy I have seen it in Davos I have seen it at edipek but I am greatly reassured that at the end of the day policy makers are sensible people and they know put the rhetoric on one side they'll be able to navigate it sensibly uh some questions you can walk up to the mic which are in front of you but let me start with my friend from Moscow thank you can you briefly introduce yourself uh and where you come from and then ask the question thank you very much Minister my name is can you raise the mic yeah yeah uh my name is Father boitolovsky I'm director of Institute of the world economy under international relations of Russian Academy of Sciences I have a question you you said I wrote a lot of right things about the crisis about uh the situation with International institutions and multilateralism and I absolutely absolutely agree with uh your assumption that uh India Brazil and in the future uh one of one of African countries are uh the major Powers uh who deserve more than any others permanent membership in the U.N security Council but my question in is concerning uh the World Trade system uh how can we think about uh developing multilateral and you know uh uh justiful uh International Trade system based on WTO and other International institutions in this situation when the practices of use of sanctions limitations uh tariffs and mercantilist practice practices of new New Times New Era developing and flourishing and what we can do with it let me start by saying I think yours is a very profound observation and I don't think me alone or anyone has all the answers when systems are not functioning there can be a variety of reasons one is that you have a system based on the rule of law Somewhere Out There and the designated body makes a recommendation legally tenable and and the country to whom its address says thank you very much but uh I don't think uh I'm going to accept what you're going to say that's one one story I'm not going to any example the second is that an existing system I'm not talking about now many years ago was manipulated so that the interests let's say hypothetically of some of the weaker trading partners were not allowed to be addressed and relief provided so if they became competitive in a particular sector while you first coerce them individually and then when you founded individual coercion didn't work you worked out an abrogation or a derogation from the free trade rules of the of the system and said this particular sector is outside the rules it's a new rules I'm talking about textiles and clothing I mean it's not uh so there are these things then you went into another round I'm talking about trade now where I said you know take it or leave it I'm gonna it's a multilateral organization but I if everybody else doesn't want to join good I'll set up a plurilateral thing I'll have a small grouping of four or six what does it mean it means essentially that and maybe that's going to be the uh wave of the future four or six of you join we'll set up select Exchange so what you are witnessing today is not new it's been coming for a long time and there have been people predecessors of Samir and Sudan and all my friends here who've been talking about addressing multilateral issues the concept the design the processes has the time come now somebody when I used to be permanent representative in New York's told me something very interesting he said a master you come here too soon I said why he said come 20 years later when the system becomes really bad then you will have a better chance of reforming it I don't know I I think that's a very defeatist sort of a line but there are people who think that that you have to really reach the you know situation where uh everybody becomes despondent is very negative and then you say okay sit down and talk I genuinely believe that you should not allow that to happen you should start addressing multilateral issues before the system cracks up just now you've got fault lines you've got individual countries having doubts you've got groups of countries having doubts a system they will say Works to the advantage to in favor of some forget about all that that's all daily negotiation but I think you've got a great opportunity what what do you need to do um I've had discussions I'm no longer I don't have the liberty or the bandwidth to deal with multilateral issues anymore I mean I deal with it now in the energy sector or in urban Affairs and I've got a plate full but I think there are a lot of good well-meaning people here you can utilize your uh expertise your Vantage position in think tanks just have a serious dialogue as to what needs to be done thank you can you introduce yourself and ask a question sure uh thank you Minister chaturvedi here from Global policy insights based out on New Delhi my question is that there's been a lot of talk around the fact that uh the developed countries haven't done their fair share in uh sustainable transitions they haven't contributed enough funds Etc and my question is that uh Beyond naming and shaming what Insight do we have on their incentives and how might we change the developed countries incentives to uh really uh you know put the money where the mouth is and uh or or do you think uh it is going to be a Perpetual sort of a prisoners dilemma between developing and developed countries or will the developing countries anyway have to step up and do this so that's my question no I have a slightly uh unconventional and probably a not a very likable view on uh in terms of the answer I have to your question I think if developing countries say that you know polluters pay principle you do your thing first I think that's not uh in their own interest at line I mean you also over duty to your next Generation yes and if you go on blaming someone else and everybody dies of toxicity uh who's going to gain I'm not I'm not trying to let the those who have to make contributions off the hook I'm not trying to do that but I think therefore our prime minister when was it and Paris he just decided to change the uh traditional Indian line and he said no I'll step forward and that's one of the best things that has happened uh as far as my policy goes no matter what the global crisis is it is not going to be allowed even to the smallest extent for our commitments on green sustainability to be diluted even by a millimeter and therefore we are stepping on the gas on green hydrogen on biofuel mixing and even though our overall um commitment net zeros 2017 most of our oil companies have taken what 20 40 2046 you can do better than that right I'll come to you and can I request Anatomy or some of my colleagues from Brazil to come forward as well because there's a Brazil connection here over to you thank you good evening Minister I'm a researcher at the Council on energy environment and water um and I'm actually very glad that you're here with us when things do seem to be falling apart it's great to hear from you um given that a lot of the ineffectiveness that you've alluded to of the multilateralism entities what is your hope uh in what India can do in trying to influence uh the Norms as we conclude G20 later this year influence the Norms related to well the membership of all of these countries are a part of the G20 right they are in the decision-making seats so how do we intend or what should Our Hope really be what are we looking forward to at the end of this year to feel like multilateralism is perhaps back on track uh in being responsive to the multiple crises that you've spoken about can we can we revive multilateralism through the G20 how do we well I I have no doubt I have no doubt I've never seen so many meetings taking place uh in within a compressed short period of time I mean um I've got other job other pieces of work to attend to but I even see Lakshmi my God they have a number of G20 things she is doing other people are doing I mean if you start with the objective which is clear that you need to address the challenges of multilateralism without saying you need to reform multilateralism the minute you use the word reform some guys will dig in some of my biggest supporter friends today uh who used to tell me don't don't talk about reform because we have earned a permanent membership because we were the victors in the second world war so I told one of them in a lighter mood after a evening session I said I don't know who wrote your history but I could easily make out that you actually didn't win the Second World War I mean somebody helped you win it but I was lighter weight look everybody looks at the multilateral system in terms of what his or her country can get out of it okay which is fair which is fair you conduct trade on that basis you conduct political negotiations on that basis but sometimes you tend to forget that are genuinely effective multilateral system is the best guarantee you have against abuse of power abuse of dominance dominant position and something which is public good so I can understand the really powerful not wanting to reform the system but when I find the not so strong also reforming is because they think the status goes very good but my submission to you the status quo is actually cracking up I mean if this continues for a while every time that you get into a problem don't go to someone who's the Empire because the Empire is blowing a whistle saying hey nobody's listening to me please introduce yourself your institution and ask the question sent from Brazil you remember me yeah we are talking today a lot about the coupling the the United States and China you know trying to split the word my question to you is in this scenario do you envisage two different trade systems and the next question is what do you think Brazil will enjoy and not in developing countries I mean emerging countries should do in this with this scenario first part is that do you imagine a dual track trading system China U.S dominating the coupling the coupling trade system and how and what should emerging economies do uh we Brazil and India and others how do we gain a more voice agency in these debates no no I I'm very happy to see my friend of many years standing because I told you I served as ambassador to Brazil between 2006 and 2008 and we've met otherwise look I say this with a sense of responsibility I have never been persuaded by this kind of talk and I heard it earlier when I was secretary economic relations in Delhi people used to talk about a G2 diarchy right I think I've told Samir over many sessions forget about it forget about it I mean countries will react in their own way I mean I'm not saying that the you can't get issue based coalitions between the Chinese and the Americans or the Chinese and the Europeans of course you'll get issue based Coalition when you make an assessment that's in your interest but to talk about diarchy Alliance I I'm not persuaded I think the systems are too um interconnected interdependent and also very different to each other I mean if you if one perceives the other as a rising power posing a threat then you even though you make a lot of money you gonna sit back and say wait a minute let me withdraw my uh investments in core sectors and there's nothing like a pandemic to teach you a few lessons I'm not saying a pandemic is a good thing I think our civil aviation Minister and I know what it is to navigate literally through a pandemic but you know supply lines Etc people become wiser when they see these challenges and see these disruptions as between India and Brazil I've been a great supporter of India and Brazil because I think these are two countries with a in many ways a similar kind of development challenge I had the privilege of being Ambassador when uh president Louise inansio Lula de Silva was President last time I had the Good Fortune of receiving his um you know uh guidance he came to India and you know the rest is history I mean during that period we did very well I'm not saying we didn't do well uh later but I think Brazil and India have many interests in common and I don't just mean the G4 I mean in the trading system I used to say when I was a young Diplomat in Geneva I just gone there I'm talking about 1981 as early as that I went to my Ambassador I know some of you have heard the story I said what do I do it's a very complicated thing you know just being you're not even I don't know how many years old I was but um 28 years old something 29 I mean thrown into a complex negotiation and asking I told my Ambassador what do I do in case I'm not following those days you didn't have iPhone he said let's listen to what the Brazilian Brazilians are saying stay within that band that was the kind of convergence we had even now if you take this away if you take some of the other stuff away there's a great amount of uh you know convergence there in terms of our objectives Etc I I learned my ethanol um from from from Brazil when I went there within a few months of arriving I met the head of uh Unica which is the uh Cooperative entity which deals with ethanol and the then president told me he said ambassador if India joins Brazil and the United States we could make ethanol an internationally traded commodity and today I mean today we are one of the top producers of ethanol in the world we are going from 10 biofuel blending to 20 percent and um I'm telling you what is already in a public domain we intend to utilize our G20 presidency to have an international biofuel Alliance so there's a lot going for countries like that so now last two questions I'll turn to my friend Andrei and then I'll invite a friend from area so uh and refers to you many thanks Sameer and many thanks Minister for your presentation I'm Andre the melee Souza I'm from uh The Institute for Applied economic research which is a Brazilian governmental Think Tank I I very much value multilateralism and I fully agree with you that we need to reform our institutions however institutions are sticky and those who now hold power they don't give it away or share it easily and moreover even those institutions that have been reformed oftentimes they give formal representation to developing countries such as ours but they don't really give influence in decision making so a seat at the table may not be sufficient in terms of these reforms so I would ask you how do you think the reform should proceed and for that purpose do we have any concrete examples of major International institutions that have been successfully reformed and maybe can guide us or at least provide some sort of a model to follow thank you I've incumbent seated Pace in any institution in the world before to newcomers and new voices not that I've heard of colonial Powers don't even leave um their you know colonies I'm not saying that all of them have to be driven out through a a movement which is revolutionary no but I think you don't need to put up a fight for everything there Comes A Time in the International narrative and people realize look it's not worth it I don't I don't you know I'm not used to name calling but it's a fact that many permanent members over the years both those aspiring to be permanent members and those who are permanent members perceptions on there being on that body have given rise to very different emotional things I mean telling you one let me talk about aspiring countries when it comes to one large continent I asked once we had a very very interesting discussion I said how does so and so look he said you know that country could look on a good on a good day I said what do you mean he said you know they've done very well in a particular thing but you know no one Are you seriously trying to tell me that a country which at the end of the second world war when the philosophy was To the victor belong the spoils but over the years its own terms of Engagement with countries in its neighborhood has changed it is no longer a member of regional grouping you ask them themselves they won't bring this so I think you don't need to bring it to a point of Crisis wherever you say I think there's somebody who seriously starts um movement towards first of all you don't need a movement you need a serious discussion can you sincerely say that the composition of that body today I'm only talking about Security Council as an example seriously reflects the uh Global situation today tomorrow if there's a crisis and you leave it to those permanent members to do some serious lifting other than one or two I don't think the other three will even volunteer to be part of the uh effort so you have the answer there so but I agree with you nobody's ever left the high table themselves normally there's an elegant way of doing it create a new table create a new table or you sit down with them they invite you then you tell them the dishes are very palatable here also in the next one it happens in a much more elegant way final question sir from my friend from area from area economic research institute for asean and East Asia again yes economic research institute for Asiana news station Jakarta and my inquiry minister is about the urban offers urbanization and the smart cities you know I think by by 2050 more than 70 percent of the population will be living in the urban areas we need to provide the more more infrastructure and and also this city is becoming a part of engines of the growth and here there is a lot of environmental problems and the social inequality and then here we have that to Smart City the application of the digital Technologies to improve these services and the living standards how do we find this role of smart cities in the future of growth and as well as what will be the agenda for the G20 agenda for the smart cities thank you you know the there is a separate Urban 20 agenda so I'm not going to digress into that but I just want to draw your attention that there are three or four separate issues which your comment um necessitates a response on first of all the Indian smart cities mission this is a project that we started in June 2015 where following a commitment that the bharatiya janta party had made in the Manifesto of for the 2014 election we said that if we come to power we will set up a hundred new smart cities that was a good few intelligent guys sitting in a room and doing drafting without knowing what they were talking about fully when we were elected in 2014 we suddenly discovered that if you use the word hundred new smart cities then you mean you have to have 100 Greenfield smart cities from scratch so we said that was never the idea because there are a lot of old cities which need to be smartified so what is a smart City it has two or three different features one is you use what is called an area based development ABD like New Delhi Municipal cooperation is a smart City or you have a green field model like raipur in where is it chattisgarh or you have some kind of a hybrid model but in each of these the proposals for the projects that you want to take up in those smart cities came from the applicants in a complete competition mode we didn't decide that this would be a smart city that we asked people to Bid And in that process a selection took place what distinguishes a smart City from any other City it uses the most modern technology state of the art for civic amenities what am I saying that if you go for instance if you come with me to Indore which is one of the cleanest cities in the world not just in India it has a huge room full of computers bright youngsters it's like a NASA war room and wherever through technology you can you got CCTV cameras all over the place you've got you can monitor with the garbage truck has picked up the garbage where is it is gone truck absolutely state of the art and in my Ministry nirman Bhavan which deals with house I have what is called the urban Observatory come there if you have some time I'll show it to you you can watch every project being monitored on a real-time basis from that room when the Prime Minister wanted an um monitoring of the six Lighthouse projects he did it on Real Time with satellite imagery and drones Etc to do that during the pandemic the smart cities it's called an integrated command and control center iccc these became War rooms for covet management and they did a fantastic job now my objective always was that in all the 100 smart cities we needed iccs now we've got all of them hundred in place a lot of people seem to mix that up with the overall Urban agenda no these were 100 cities which were selected will we get more I don't know many other state governments have utilized a smart City model without getting funding you see the Smart City model is very interesting uh total project cost is not very much I think two hundred and five thousand crores out of which the centers allocations about 99 000 crores and forty forty five percent I I stand subject to be correct it comes from public private partnership now you have the option of doing the same thing yourself so many cities in India the state government says there's something very good going we'll do it we don't need these from the central listing how much of the Indian population will be living in urban areas I can give you a little perspective in 1947 when we became an independent country 17 used to stay and live in urban areas then the population base was 350 million today when a census comes you would think I think you'll discover that by 2030 by the time you finish agenda 2030 or the sustainable development goals you will have something like 40 percent or 600 million people staying there my predecessor who went on to become vice president he used to use a term Urban Renaissance I am much more modest I use the word Rejuvenation we are building according to Mackenzie 700 to 900 million square meters of urban space every year which is equivalent of a Chicago so India is building one Chicago every year that gives you an idea of how much Urban space is being built and rebuilt Delhi the population out of the 20 million we have work in progress now and in the coming years where 13.5 million of delhi's residents will have new homes whether it comes from Khan low-cost housing cross subsidize you know where you call them informal settlements here they still use a pejorative term slums we are rebuilding those resettling people The Honorable prime minister settled gave keys to several of the beneficiaries of the 3000 Flats in east of kailash we have many more such projects and pipeline so India is being rebuilt Urban space already is contributing to the bulk of the GDP I don't remember often 65 already two-thirds two-thirds of our GDP comes from the urban space so the demographic shifts which will take place from the semi Urban to the urban or from the rural to tier two and three cities the connectivity it's some fantastic amount of demographic changes are taking place and India will adjust to those so thank you very much Minister we spoke about the international order multilateralism energy Urban Affairs and of course trade please join me in applauding the minister for his contribution and uh so there's a small token from the T20 for you it's great catching up with you guys thank you thank you thank you so much [Applause]

were murdered I was did you lie to sled agent Owen and deputy Laura Rutland on the night of June 7th and told them that you stayed at the house after dinner I did lie to them did you lie to agent oh and agent Croft on the follow-up interview on June 10th that the last time you saw Maggie and Paul was at dinner I did lie to them and then the interview of August 11th did you tell agent Owen and agent crawl did you lie to them by telling them that you were not down at the Kennels on that night yes Alec why did you lie Sage Owen agent Croft and Deputy Rutland about the last time you saw Maggie and Paul as my addiction evolved over time I would get any situations or circumstances where I would get paranoid thinking uh and it could be anything that that triggered it might be a look somebody gave me it might be a reaction somebody had to something I did um it might be a policeman following me in in a car um that night June 7th after finding mags and Paul Papa don't talk to anybody without Danny with you all my partners were just repeatedly telling me that I had a deputy share taking gunshot tests from my hands I'm sitting in a police car with David Owen asking me about my relationship with my wife and my son and all those things coupled together after finding them coupled with my distrust for sled caused me to have paranoid thoughts normally when these paranoid thoughts would hit me I could take a deep breath real quick just think about it reason my way through it and just get past it really quickly on June the 7th I wasn't thinking clearly I don't think I was capable of reasons [Music] and I lied about being down there and I'm so sorry that I did I'm sorry to my son buster I'm sorry to Grandma Papa t I'm sorry to both of our families foreign I'm sorry to Max and Papa I would never intentionally do anything to hurt either one of them ever ever foreign lying after that night did you not but once I lied I continued to lie yes sir wow you know what a tangled web we weave but once I told the LIE and I told my family I had to keep mine foreign Alex tell the jury what happened on the evening of June 7th starting when you met him for Paul I had been at work that day uh a fairly normal day um you may start in the morning or sure start in the morning um just a regular morning Maggie was leaving to go out of town um she was she was going to a doctor's appointment and um she had some stuff to do at edista where she was having some work done on our house that had stuff um so but Maggie was there that morning she went to leave and she told me she was doing these things um I always always ask Maggie to come back home and stay with me um but anyway Maggie had left she did her thing um I went to work did work I learned from Paul Paul that who's Paul that's Paul my son Papa my son Paul murdered and your name for him was pawpaw yeah we I mean we called him Papa okay go ahead I'm sorry and um and they bust your mag I pretty I called him Paul Paul or Paul Terry um but Max caught him pawpaw bus called him Papa um a lot of people called him Papa but anyway I learned about the I'd known that CB the guy that worked for us had sprayed the sunflowers I I knew about that but I'd been out of town um I didn't know they were dead Paul let me know they had died so we had to replant the dove feel that that's not the fear which that that feels just a big big social part of of of having property people would come and it's just a social big part of it so the Doug field was a big deal so when when the sunflowers got killed Paul was we knew they were dead Paul was coming home and I learned that early Monday morning and did um and we'll we'll catch back up but at some point in time did you meet up with Paul yeah after work I met Paul at the at the property and and I'm and we're gonna backfill and talk about more of the day but I just want to focus in on that evening right now okay when Paul gets to the property what do y'all doing first thing we do is we go to the field and and we look at the duff feel and um how'd you get to the duck field uh he had come in uh my brothers truck we got in my son Buster's black pickup truck we called it Buster truck or the black pickup truck you've heard it called too but I I call it Buster's truck okay so you're gonna Buster's truck and you and you go to the dove field to tell the jury what else well that's the first thing we do we we go to the dove field and we look and it was clearly it didn't you could tell they were I mean you could tell they've been sprayed and you could tell they were dead uh I mean they might have still had a tiny bit of light but they were dead so we knew that so we knew we had to re-plant the whole field um so that didn't take but a second um but after that Paw Paw foreign we just rode the property we spent time together we finished we rode around and we spent time together on the property do you go to the duck pond oh yeah we went uh we went to several food plots we went to um single oak stand we called it which is across the road um I know we went to the bridge stand we went to the um we went to the duck pond where we stayed for a minute and did you um I can remember the duck Vine specifically because I had helped Paw Paw plant the dove feel and uh the corn in the dove field so sunflowers corn sunflowers going and I'd help him plant the Sun the corn in this in the dove field pawpaw had planted the duck pond by himself and he's making a really big deal to me about how much better the corn was doing in the duck Bond than it was in the dove field we stayed there for a little while we rode we were at the cabin for a little while we rode around the cabin looking at it no cabinet is what that's um it's just a a little small it's truly a cabin it's a it's a four room uh structure it's got a little living area a little kitchen it's got two little bedrooms and one little bathroom and this what you've heard talk about where the kids stayed some Summers and um is that what the jury seen since some overhead pitchers it's just right there on mozell road yeah it's right it's right up on Moselle Road and it's very close to the um the the driveway that goes to the shop and the Kennels did you spend any time at the shop you think oh yes I mean the shop was I mean that was sort of um The Hub that that was the main place if you weren't at the house you might be out going to this field or this food plot or this duck pond or or this part of the the river but the the the shop is where the kennels were located you know that was you were always there something was always going on there you're always doing something there that's where all the tools were that's where all the equipment was kept I mean that was that was the main Hub right and so we were there that day I mean there was a point in time where we unloaded the bulldozer that um that that had been on a different part of the property was on a trailer we Lo unloaded it and sprayed it down real quick I was just one of the many things we did that day one of the things the jury seen uh Alec is is a Snapchat video of you and and doing something with a tree do you remember that oh yeah so what what was happening there that's just part of when we were we were riding that that particular location where that was is at a food plot that that we called Sawtooth Oaks and it was named that because there was some Sawtooth Oaks that were planted there that you can't see in the in the picture but uh what that tree is and all these food plots there's an area where it it's not as big as the field but it's like a field where you plant vegetation for for wildlife like it might be cow peas or soybeans but you plant and then there's a feeder to to attract deer then we planted these little fruit trees on these stands and what you see me doing is fooling with a fruit tree that I'd been tending to it had fallen over I had straps on it I had strings on it that were holding it up one of the strings popped I undid the other string and it was falling over and Papa was laughing at me trying to get it back up right that was it's just a fruit tree that I've been dealing with for really for years and it wouldn't stand up straight and were you and Paul having a good time at that point you could not be around Papa you could not be around him and not have a good time were you were you close to Paul you couldn't be any closer then Papa and uh and Buster and I were in our he's just wonderful one and one of the things you enjoyed doing together and just riding the property I love doing anything with pawpaw it was an absolute Delight but yeah one of the things I mean Paul's passion I mean Paul was passionate about a lot of things but that property was really a passion to his I mean he loved to do he loved to work it he loved to work with Fields he loved to work with food plots he loved to hunt I mean he he'd work on the roads I mean he would he would work on all of it I mean he would work on destruction and he would he he worked on the whole property it was it was his passion so in the evening of the seventh you know Jerry's been in undated with data from various different sources but sure just ballpark can you I mean knowing you know what we know now after reviewing everything but roughly when do you remember Paul getting there and you getting there starting to ride the property uh now that I've had the benefit of of seeing all of these records um Papa got home I believe a little bit before seven o'clock and I got home a little bit before him I think the details had been that I got home around 6 40 2 or 6 45 or something like that and Paul got there yeah very quickly thereafter and then by seven o'clock so you rode the property for a while um do you remember when Maggie arrived yeah it was it was later than that it was eight or after eight I think it was after eight and looking at the records a little bit after eight and and do you remember um do you remember her arriving or where you were when she arrived I believe that I was at the shop when when she came through which would not be unusual for her having been away um if Blanca had gotten the mail or somebody got in the mail maybe not but if somebody had not gotten a mail it would be perfectly normal for her to pull through that and I believe she did pull through there that day and Paul and I were at the shop I believe and then what what did you do after Maggie arrived Maggie went to the house and I know that um but shortly after however I learned that Maggie got home I went to the house when when Maggie got home and I left Paul at the shop so uh and what'd you do when you got to the house I saw Maddox talk to Max um and I took a shower um the the clothes that we saw in that Snapchat video was uh is that the clothes you had on at work that day yes that was all the clothes I had on at work that day and the and the jury seen you and um in those clothes and and once on June 7th how tall were you and how much did you weigh um on June 7th well I'm I'm six a little I'm a hair over six four right at six four oh June the 7th I was about 265 pounds 264 265. and um and this was in June June 7th yes sir when you're outside riding around and doing some do you get hot and sweaty absolutely I mean Paul and I have done some things we we unloaded bulldozer clean the bulldozers we fooled around yeah I mean I sweated I was you know I was heavy and taking prescription pills also makes you sweat worse or at least taking oxycodone makes you sweat more than you normally do so was it unusual for you to take a shower when you got back to the house not at all and that when you after you took a shower what did you change into I changed into the clothes that you've seen in this trial shorts in the shirt okay when you got out of the shower and changed clothes what'd you do next I went back out where Max and papa were and uh for dinner what's going on Max said as you've heard Blanca had prepared dinner but uh it had been cooked earlier mags had fixed I know Max had fixed mine and her plate because I didn't fix a plate she may have fixed Papa Papa was eating and Papa was almost done eating by the time I got back out which also wasn't unusual I mean Papa was always on the go I mean he he never sat still and you know he'd sit down to eat but then he's going on to his next item and uh so the Maggie and I ate and you already at the table you down what's your normal habit oh we would do both but I mean when we ate at the table it was really sort of more formal or or not formal but just more of an organized thing our normal what we would normally do on a regular evening is we would eat in the den in front of the TV and that's where we ate that day I ate on the couch the table Maggie had a little um a TV tray that she kept over there and and pawpaw would usually sit in a recliner and and eat off of the Ottoman was the TV on yes was that normal for the TV to be on yes TV if we were in the House the TV was on wow so what what happened next Alan uh Papa moved on doing whatever he was doing I don't know if he was in The Gun Room doing something or he was in his room doing something he was outside doing something I actually thought he'd gone to the shed but in looking at to the shop but in looking at the the benefit of having these records um that we have I know he was still at the house or somewhere around the house doing something but he wasn't in there with Maggie and I um but Maggie wanted to go to the kennels and uh I had eaten dinner I laid back on the couch where I was sitting and Maggie wanted to go to the kennels and she asked me to go and and I didn't I didn't go at that time I didn't want to go why didn't you want to go oh it was hot um I just had a shower I knew I'd end up doing more work sweating more and and the dogs is always a chaotic scene and I just don't want to go right there well let me ask you what what had you done the previous days like Friday and Saturday and Sunday um start with Friday or go backwards yeah yeah start start with Friday all right on that just briefing so seven six fifth fourth so June 4th uh my dad was in the hospital and Savannah Georgia at Memorial hospital and I went down to visit him Friday afternoon and I stayed with him in the hospital I spent the night there you know he was real sick I mean he was having a hard time um did you get much sleep Friday night no I mean I had a a real sweet nurse found me that first there was just a hard chair in there like this but a nurse found me a soft chair sort of like a recliner so I mean I I'm sure I slept but I didn't sleep you know I didn't get a night's sleep no sir and then Saturday and Sunday Saturday we had plans with um with um Buster in Brooklyn I've heard about Brooklyn there's Buster's wonderful little girlfriend and Max and I had plans with them to meet them in Columbia to go to the uh South Carolina uh it was a regional baseball tournament and South Carolina was playing Virginia I believe so when I got back from Savannah and met up with mags at some point we we headed to Colombia so I mean it wasn't a lot going on in between there we headed up to Columbia and met bus in Brooklyn and then and you stayed did you stay in Columbia Saturday night we did we went to the Ball Game and I remember it was an evening game we went pretty early and tailgated Maggie and Maggie had reconnected with the college friend who coincidentally had married a college friend of mine and they had a son that played for Carolina he was a first baseman and a really good little player and we met them and tailgated with them and it was a lot of fun they had a lot of the parents of the players that were playing for Carolina and it was just it was it was a fun time we tailgated and then we went to and it was a night game so we went to the game and the game got over um you know it was fairly late into the evening and after that bus Brooklyn and Max and I uh believe we went to the restaurant in the hotel where we were staying but we went had dinner and and and then bus and Brooklyn went home and of course Maggie and I went to our room and then you know the next day was there another game another game the next day um that's right and uh and then you after that you head back to Moselle with Maggie yeah we went to the game um that's right Max and I go back to um the Moselle the jury's heard about I think Ms Ross talking about you bringing Krispy Kreme Donuts to your dad Maggie loved she she spoiled my bed and always always taking him something my dad loves sweets and she and I pick up donuts and took uh Krispy Kreme donuts to him and then um you must spend the night together at Moselle on Sunday night did you both spend the night at Moselle on Sunday night yes and then the seventh was a work day that's right it's a Monday Monday June the 7th I'll be afraid of it oh I'm sorry it was Monday The Seventh-Day work day for you yes and and I just wanted to give that background and so moving forward to when you testified previously about Maggie asking you to go to the kennels where you tired oh yes I was tired and you had just had a shower just had a shower and um and you said that well did you go with Maggie to the Kennels immediately no I did not what'd you do what did she leave yes she did she left and pawpaw was gone do you know how she got to the kennel at the time I didn't but now looking at these condensed records um and and understanding the timeline is clear to me that she rode with pawpaw and uh and did you stay in the house yes for how long not long I laid back on the couch put my feet up and like many times when Maggie asked me to do something that I didn't want to do or didn't start out doing I changed my mind and decided I'm gonna ride up there and I did and how did you get to the to the kennels I went on a golf cart um was it was the golf cart at the house the main house yeah and it was there most of the time and when you got down to the kennels what was happening uh it just what I thought it was um it was a little bit of chaos I mean it was clear to me that Max had just let the dogs out um the two dogs that were out were really her pet dogs one is Grady you've heard about a black lab that's Grady that's Buster's dog and the other is the yellow lab that you've heard about that's Bubba Bubba was mine and Maggie's dog but it was really mine Maggie's bus and pawpaw's dog it was a family dog um but Bubba's a dog I hunted um I mean Maggie loved Bubba she loved Grady too but I mean she had a special place for the bubble but anyway when the dogs first were let out the first thing they would do is they would run you you if you look at the overhead um picture that you've seen that were planted Pines right behind the Kennels so you got the kennels and and and the chicken coop sort of form an l-shape and in that L with some planted Pines first thing the dogs would do is go out in that um Channel and you know Baba and and Grady I think learned this from Bubba but Grady would do it too but Bubba had to Mark every tree I mean he he would go and he'd do a little number on this tree and actually you know dogs did and this marking his territory um and so that was the first thing those dogs did when they came out when I got there those dogs were in that area so that's why I believed that it hadn't been long before they've been let out um Grady was chasing guineas um which was a normal thing to do what what a Danish uh guinea fowl is a guinea fowl is like um it's like a chicken it's a domestic bird that you know we had them I they make a lot of Racket it's like a you know I know this sounds silly but it's like a a guard bird um because anytime you know they just make a lot of Racket anytime anything unusual is going on if anything if anything disturbs them could be a person it could be somebody driving up whatever they gonna make a lot of Rapids so um Grady's chasing the guineas um you know Paul's fooling with um Rogan's dog cash um Maggie's just kind of standing there watching the dogs which is normal and they were in that place as as the dogs were out longer they Branch out more um but at that point in time they were they were right there so that told me they hadn't been out um a long time Bubba Bubba catches a chicken um I'm talking to Maggie for just you know a short time before Bubba catches the chicken I take the chicken put it when Bubba Bubba didn't chase these dogs didn't chase the chickens to kill them and they didn't normally kill them they did kill them sometimes but it was about to chase with those dogs and and they were proud when they caught one you could just tell by the way Bubba would Prince to you when he brought chicken to you he was proud that he had caught it but he wasn't trying to kill it and so most times the chicken wasn't dead and that chicken wasn't dead um but a lot of times they would be stunned and they would be just real lethargic so you had to take the chicken and you had to put it up somewhere where you know the chicken could be by itself for a minute and and it would eventually usually you know come back to normal and go on about its you know whatever chicken does did you get the chicken out of Bubba's mouth I did I took the chicken from Bubba and I put it um on top of that no no we've seen you know this video of Paul um with cash rogenstall something did you know did you know that was going on what do you remember about that about yeah I knew Paul was I knew Paul was fooling with um when I pulled up on the golf cart Maggie was standing back sort of where the driveway would be um it sort of runs out at the feed room um storage rooms what we call has been called a feed room um but it sort of ran out Maggie was a little bit further up where she could see back in that angle where the dogs were Paul was fooling with um Rogan's dog back towards the kennel if I remember when I first got there Paul was more in the driveway but then I knew Paul was in the kennel fooling with cash yes but did I know what he was doing I didn't know exactly what he was doing though did um I knew he was fooling with his I knew he was fooling with his tail what was was Cash in the kennel when when you pulled up you think not when I first got there uh did Bob or Grady have any uh collars on yes which both dogs one dog you remember I don't know about Grady but I know Bubba had on his what we call a tracking collar Paul first hunting dogs um Paul had a system a series of tracking collars and I think there were five that might have been six but it's a tracking collar um that had a a device that would tell you where that column was so that this bubble was bad about you know he would he would stay close for a minute but then he would take off and he especially do that on Maggie he would he would take off and run and so he had on the tracking collar that if he did that you could you know you you could know okay he's you know a half a mile down here it's not going to follow him but so far but it would follow a good long distance so you could go get the dog um if he ran off which Bubba frequently would do especially when it was just mags and Bubba um and so Paul probably would have been the one to put that on bubba so you've got us where you've gotten to checking out of Bubba's mouth and put it up on a doghouse or something I believe I believe what I put it on it this but I've seen pictures in all this and I saw the chicken sitting on top of the um what looks to me like a portable dog crate whatever wherever it was sitting on there is where I would have put it up there you know the main reason to believe anybody else moved that chicken and It ultimately that chicken did die and um what'd you do after you got the chicken out of Bubba's mouth I got out of there I I I I left I went back to the house all right well look before we do that um we've seen that dog kennel video with cash and Mr Davis and we slowed it down for him do you see the water hose in that video on the ground you remember seeing that I did was a water hose out and obviously um in the video but can I I don't specifically remember that but I can look in that video and see it right but that's not something that I noticed so but you've seen it in the video here yes sir and then the two dogs were out absolutely Bubba and Grady and then you you had behind you get back to the house same route I mean same route I'd come on I came down the driveway made a left on uh you saw my route um in the car I made I drove that same route my question was obviously wasn't clear enough what were you in a vehicle you walked what mode of transportation did you use to get back to the house same way I came I went back in the golf cart it is the golf cart if you remember that Mark Ball testified that he saw where we normally would park it you'd pull up and pull along the the front entrance and if you come in from the left and you'd go just past it and be on the right or you come in from the right and you'd be just past it on the left and that's where I got in it and that's where I put it back did you do anything else before leaving after you took the chicken out above his mouth no we've heard about Bubba being stubborn how long did it take you to get chicken out above his mouth oh Bubba could be stubborn but Bubba would listen to me and uh and and another thing when Bubba had on that collar one of the other features of that collar was what did Bo have on the collar was a great Bubba hat on the collar Bubba had the Color Bob I know Bubba had a collar on and I'm not sure about Grady okay go ahead if I misspoke on that there's no question about it Bubba had on a collar I assume Grady did too um but I didn't I I didn't even I saw Grady I didn't notice for a fact that Grady had on the collar okay but he probably did so makes sense to me that he did how long did it take to get the chickens out of him no chicken out of Bubba's mouth it didn't take it didn't take long number one Bubba's coming back there to show me hey I caught this chicken so he's not running from me he's proud of that fact that he caught this chicken so I mean he's he comes right up to me um Bubba was really strong uh but you know you just you take your thumb when the dog's clenched and his mouth a little bit open all you do is you take your thumb and you push his gum in really tight against those sharp teeth and his mouth opens right up took the chicken out and put it on I believe the portable dog kennel and then left and then I left then leave okay and what did you go back to the house I went straight back to the house to the air conditioner and what'd you do when you got back to the house I laid down on the couch and then what well I mean it was TV on when he went back yeah I mean the the TV never got cut off so he went back to the house she laid down on the couch and then what happened next I'm not uh I'm not positive I dozed off for a minute or didn't doze off for a minute but I got up off of the couch uh and I was I made up my mind I was going to visit my mom had you spoken to Barbara Mixon earlier in the day I did I talked to Barbara most days if I didn't see her I talked to her and what was your understanding of of your mother's uh condition um late on the afternoon of the seventh she was agitated which she got agitated uh when my dad you know I mean we were putting my dad in the hospital I mean he had a lot over to 18 months two years I mean my dad was in the hospital he's in the hospital a lot and my mom I believe my mom knew when my dad wasn't there because I mean she would get agitated I mean that's just the only term you can think of she get agitated she she cried a lot she'd um she'd be fussy when she normally wouldn't be fussy I mean she was I know Alzheimer's patients are unpredictable but I'm convinced she knew because it happened frequently and Barbara Ann told me your mom's agitated you need to check on her I gave her medicine she's resting um so it wasn't anything urgent but she's resting so what what Barbara would do and Barbara could handle her Barbara could handle her better than I mean my mama we all love Barbara my mama love Barbara my mama could get I mean Barbara could get my mom to do things that nobody else when she fussed for anybody else including me or my brothers or my sisters Barbara could get her you know in in order and um but Barbara giving her medicine and and to settle her down and calm her down and that would sometimes make her go to sleep for a little while but then she be agitated when she woke up the uh so did you go check on your mom I did um did um where did you park when you got there saw the pictures there's two exits off of that um deck one of them to the right one of them straight out that back door I would have parked to the left if you if you're coming down these steps if these are the steps it would be to the left and back over there all right um which is where I always park or where we always Park anytime you were going in that entrance all right I'm gonna stop there and ask Doug if you don't mind pulling up States exhibit 524 which is the GM OnStar data and the slide 38 um which is in evidence [Music] can you can you see this uh the slide with those dots yes sir I can I can and and the red dots here at the um that seem to be joined where is that in relation to your parents house where the arrow is yes sir all right that's back in the area where I'm talking about all right so if you look in this picture all right you see that you you see the open area with the green grass that's the that's the front door okay yeah right right where that circle is that's the front door if you look at closely at the house you can see a big Dormer right in the middle of the roof that's right over the front door the white thing to the left of the house that's like a parking pad where the where the driveway is and there's a parking pad it's like so you go if you follow the driveway all the way to the house you're gonna run straight into a carport all right by the by the carport door just to the left before you get to the carport is this area that you can see here that's that's part driveway mainly parking pad all right I'm gonna um like if you'll pull up Defender exhibit 130 which is in evidence please sir foreign and from this photo can you point out roughly where where you normally where you park that evening all right this is the this is the entrance to the right that I'm talking about there's an exit and an entrance uh right in front of that door that you see there so if you came down those steps walk to your left would be down there would be where I parked oh we would you have parked on the grass there's some there's somebody about a house where it's sodded and sure this this grass that you can really see in this picture so it may be on the edge of the grass yes in relation to the satellite dish um are you looking this photo are you to the right of that yeah you'd be to the right of that satellite dish okay yes and and they want that satellite dish is right on the edge of the um you know there's there's a hedge and like you see the I don't know what you call it a border like a border where the grass ends and the flower bed or whatever it is starts right I think you can't see it but I think that satellite's probably close to that border all right well let's um so it'd be to the let's write that in this picture Doug uh when you pull up a defendants exhibit 134 see if this is a foreign are those the ones where you would enter right these are the steps that I used that night that we always used and one of the reasons being is my dad this this door goes into what we call the Breakfast room the breakfast room leads right into the kitchen and so straight through this door all of the breakfast room is kind of to the left that door goes straight through another door way there's no door there but it's like a just the opening it goes into the kitchen immediately to your right of that entrance into the kitchen is the entrance into where my Mom and Dad's rooms were so if you went through that door you were in a little area that had my mom's closet my Dad's closet um a little bit further you go into my mom's bedroom if you went to the right you would go my my dad and my mom didn't sleep in the same room at this point but the bedrooms were you know they were back to back there was a door going from one to the other that was blocked that was there and then there was a bathroom so this is really this is really the part of the house that at their age was getting used so that's why you went in this entrance because my mom and whoever was caring for her was always in her bedroom which would be just on the other side of the room that has these windows that you see to the right all right those would be the windows for the room where my dad slept right and then my mom's right on the other side the kitchen's right there this is the part of the house they were always in and are you the only one that would pull up in the back like that no it's a common for your brothers and your sister to do the same oh we all did it I mean we all we all part in in the same way if you knew you were going to the front of the house or if you knew there was a crowd there or for whatever you may park on the driveway but if you knew under normal circumstances my dad always stayed in the breakfast room where he had a recliner and a TV that's where my dad always was my dad never you would never go catch him sitting in the den up front or in a in a living room he he just wasn't up there he was in this room watching TV or either he was on this back deck and my mom was either in her room which was just off of that or she might be in the kitchen or the breakfast room and when you got to the house who was there your mother's house on the night of June 7th my mom was there and Shelly Smith was there and and what did you do when you got there uh the first thing I did was I tried to I tried to I knocked on the door the door was locked I knocked on the door Shelly didn't hear me and then what'd you do next I called called what I called my mom's house to let Shelley know I was there please come let me in and and set the house phone has been referred to yes okay and did she let you in sure and then what happened next I went in and I visited with my mom I mean let me go into detail on that well just briefly yeah what'd you do I went in the house in my mom's bedroom my mom had a bed that was where she slept in normal times it's like uh you know a bed with um you know the poles coming out of the corner a poster bed that um coming out of the corners and she had a bed like that that where she slept but she didn't sleep there anymore but it was in the room it was a hospital bed so when you when you walked in a room her bed was to the right against the wall to the left was a hospital bed like a single bed um but a hospital bed and a TV and then there was a recliner where whoever was helping her would would usually sit so I went in and I sat down on my mom's hospital bed and I just talked to her for a minute my mom was awake and I held her hand and what kind of condition was she in uh she was in her condition was not good at any time but given her overall condition she seemed to be doing pretty well I mean she wasn't agitated like I thought she would be or like I was worried she would be or like Barbara had described her at that point so she she wasn't agitated and uh you know I just talked to her anytime we talked to my mom we always tried to be real positive and um you know upbeat and just and I just talked to him you know I just talked to him made sure she was okay um did you stay seated on the side of her Hospital style bed or did you move around I mean I stayed there for a few minutes uh you know I stayed there and I talked to her more than just a few seconds and then but but I didn't stay there um she was uh she she did look tired um so I I got up and I went and I I think I sat on my mom's bed for a minute to start with and then I laid down on my mom's bed which is you know that's what I I normally did when I went in there it wasn't like a lot of chairs to sit in um and I just laid back on the bed now when I talked to Shelly and we watched TV now when you're talking about your mom's better you're referring to her regular bed that's right not not her hospital bed not the bed she was in but her her bed the one I was talking about would like posts right um the um let me skip something um was Maggie planning to go over to your mother's with you that night nah she wasn't planning to go with me that night okay well in fact Maggie didn't really like to visit my mom um it was she loved to visit my dad and she loved to spend time with my dad and she spent a lot of time with my mom when my mom was healthy but you know I mean by this point my mom and she was a chef and she was a chef of her old self and I mean it was kind of I mean it was kind of sad to go and visit her anytime I mean she she just she wasn't healthy and Maggie didn't like to go and just visit my mom when when you when you left Mozelle the Hat head to Almeda um the evening after you'd go back to the house at Moselle what what exit did you use of the Moselle property when you're going to Almeda on the evening of June 7th I went out the main gates which would be straight ahead the um you've heard the two gates there's there's the shop entrance um there's actually several entrances but the main ones we used it was an entrance by the dove field it was an inches further down by Sawtooth Oaks but the main ones we used were the shop entrance and what we call the main entrance where the brick Gates were did you go why didn't you go by the kennels on your way home there wasn't a reason to go by the kennels at that point and I was going to Almeda which that the main gate would be to the gates that were closer did you notify Maggie uh in some form that you were leaving to go to uh see your mom I tried to call her and and did she answer no and what'd you do after that I think I tried to call her again and did she answer no she didn't answer and at some point I texted her after that well the fact that she didn't answer on two times from did that concern you at that time right it didn't concern me at all number one she was with pawpaw foreign so no I mean number two I mean it's not unusual to not be able to get somebody all the time when they're at the house or they're just on a property I mean you've heard all the testimony about how spotty cell service was so no at the time it didn't strike me as anything unusual now I'm moving back to Almeda you've spent time with your mother and then then you'll have to head head back to Moselle is that correct that's correct did you write did you drop straight back to myself I did no Alec there's some um information from the Telemetry data off your suburban and perhaps some of this OnStar GPS data that indicates that at some point in time in your mother's driveway you stop for about a minute do you recall seeing that data I did what were you doing when you stopped did you recall I was getting my phone that uh I I my phone had gotten there's a console in the middle of my car and my phone had gotten down in the console between the console and the seat where you couldn't get to it were you during that minute or however long it was were you disposing of murder weapons Alan no were you disposing of bloody clothes no and your your ride back to um Moselle was it uh were you driving faster than normal normal I was driving however I drive the normal way that I drive foreign back to the Moselle property how did you enter the property what entrance did you use came right back through the main gate and what'd you do then went straight to the house and when you got to the house what'd you do I went inside were lights on when you pulled up or lights were on in the house for sure I can't remember if there were flood lights on or not I I don't believe there were any flood lights on but they were definitely lights all the all the lights in the house were on yes and when you um how long do you stay inside the house roughly uh now that I've seen the benefit of these records I was in there several minutes obviously I mean were you surprised that Paul and Maggie had not made it back to the house you know I don't know surprise is the right word but I mean I would have I thought they would have been back by then you know but I mean did it cause me to go into any it wasn't like I was shocked but I mean I thought they would be there I mean I I distinctly remember uh you know I went and looked sometimes I was very hot natured number one I was hot that was heavy and I was taking pills so I was always hot Maggie was always cold sometimes she would watch TV we had a TV in the um hunting room you see on the wall there sometimes Maggie would be in there watching TV where she could have the thermostat different than we always kept it cold in the in the main part of the house so I know I I know I went in there and looked in there for her uh it's not unusual for Maggie to be taking a bath and be uh not able to hear me so I went back there and and I know I did those two things and and looked in those two places and they weren't there and so you know I knew they'd been at the kennels and I assumed they were still up there so what'd you do I went to the Kennels I may have tried to call them and in fact I probably did try to call them we I I would think I called them um but as I sit here right now I'm not positive but I would think I did would think I tried to call them to see and now like when you did you drive down to the kennels in your suburban foreign what'd you see so much else in pictures of foreign so bad can I have some water yeah I went to um did you see them on the ground when you're pulling up in your suburban it did and what'd you do when you came to a stop Alec I think I jumped out of my car I'm not exactly sure what I did but no I got out of my car I know I ran back to my car called 9-1-1 I was up I called 911 I was on the phone with 9-1-1 I was trying to fall ball I was trying to tend to maggot and then she went back and forth between them where you um going to Paul and Maggie while you were on the phone with the um 911 operators yes yes and in a little bit I'm gonna play the 911 tape and I just want to I ask you and and you've told law enforcement it's been played here in the court um did you what did you do when you went up to Paul at some point in time Paul oh so you're so bad at some point I know I mean I know I tried to check him for a pulse um I know I tried to turn him over when you say you've tried to turn him over what why were you trying to turn him over I don't know I don't know I don't know why I tried to turn a movie me and my boys laying Ace down these done ways done it was the waves it was I could see you could see his brain laying on the sidewalk I didn't know what to do I mean that's got chatted Tony Mo she got grabbed him by the belt loop and try to turn him over and when I did his phone popped out it was I mean his phone popped up and just pick it up and I'll put it right back there do you have any idea how it popped out I mean I know it came out of his pocket when I pulled on his belt loop when I when I pulled him to turn him over and it just popped out and I mean it popped right beside him and sat right beside him where you at were you able to turn Paul at all I mean I I did it I don't know if I was able to I didn't turn them over no no what what side of the um what side of Paul were you when you were doing this I was on um I was on the side that was away from I was on the side that was away from where my car was okay I mean uh what'd you do with the phone I put it back on Papa you know if you put it you know which way was pointing upside down and downside and anyway couldn't tell you anything about it I know his phone popped out I picked it up and I put it back on it did you see any messages on Paul's phone no foreign did you touch her I did where did you touch Maggie I think I touched her down she's around like the I don't know I don't know if you if you ask me exactly I I think I touched her down around her waist but I don't know so bad you are watching the testimony of Alec Murdoch who has been on the witness stand for nearly 70 minutes now testifying on his own behalf in the double murder trial he is accused of killing his wife and son in 2021 something that he denied on the stand saying I would never intentionally do anything to hurt either one of them joining us now for more analysis is attorney and legal analyst Angela cenadella you know a week or two ago if you had asked us is Alec we're not going to take the stand in his own defense we probably would have said the odds are slim to none and yet here we are why is this happening is it helping him or hurting him so far I think it's hurting him there is no no way this is helping him but he did it because it was a Hail Mary there was that million dollar question of the kennel video and why was his voice there when he claims he has an alibi in a totally separate location so we saw here sandwiched in between first his denial of I did not kill my son or my wife and then a lot of tears but slid in the middle there we heard him say I did lie I lied to the police I lied to sled I lied to everybody so the defense is hoping that that's just gonna roll over and we're gonna forget about that but that's the biggest part that we learned today and the defense is sort of slowly walking him through what is a new timeline it's amended timeline where he did go to the kennels how effective is it is it right now that they're working this new information in that he was actually at the kennels while trying to stick with that original timeline at the same time it's so ineffective it's like a house of cards at this point everything rests on The defendant's credibility so when you pinpoint him in a massive lie like this one of where he was at the time this happened everything just starts to become unbelievable as a sure you look at that and you think if I don't believe him on this major issue perhaps nothing he says is credible let's be clear early in his testimony the words that came out of his mouth were I did lie to them talking about investigators I did lie to them I mean when your testimony starts with that and we are now pretty much toward the end of the trial weeks and weeks of testimony if you're a juror what do you think is going through their minds right now you're thinking this guy is not believable at all why is he bringing this up now if it truly was just because it was a mistake that he could have brought up earlier but no this seems criminal this is a big deal the jurors are not going to forget this as far as the prosecution's case so far it seems like jurors wants they want DNA they want like scientific evidence and that type of thing it doesn't seem like they've actually gotten this but now with him on the stand we're expecting cross after this what do you expect to happen in that class in Cross I expect them to delve into the financial crimes because we saw a huge decision by the judge where we saw the defense attempt to quest to limit the cross to not include his financial crimes but the judge is great and the judge said I'm not going to do that that's not fair that's not what we do so we're going to see cross establish him further as a liar once you establish as a liar financially to his family to investigators why is anybody going to believe him let's be clear here the goal here you say is a Hail Mary all it takes right is one juror to have Reasonable Doubt and there is a lot of emotion right now I mean especially over the last few minutes we've seen him talk about in his words basically discovering the bodies of his wife and son and what came with that can that emotion have some power yes but emotion is a double-edged sword because on one hand jurors can see that and think wow he is a grieving person on the other side when you see emotional defendants on the stand people don't always believe them the jurors think wow that was a show so they look at the entirety of the testimony if you're watching right now right now they are playing the 911 tapes from when Alex Murdoch made the call to 9-1-1 let's listen in for a second here a little bit we've got a whole lot right here okay okay do you see anything do you see anyone in the area no ma'am at all coming outside if that's what you're asking they didn't keep themselves man what Alec right right in there you say the word here what are you calling anybody or anything no I'm talking to that dispatcher and what did you mean when you said here if you listen to that call one of the first things she asked me it's one of the first things she asked me was did they shoot themselves and that new new there's no way all right we've been listening to the 9-1-1 calls involved in this case is Alec Murdock takes the stand in his own defense a move that we did think um was unexpected until today now he is there answering questions from his defense team so far we are waiting for cross-examination to happen after this yeah it'll be a long day of testimony ahead for Alec Murdoch we will continue covering it here on NBC news now stay with us more news after this how many of you were up there at least like 11. how real is this going back to the Moon this is what it looks in front of the storm Zone and there was nobody there well let's talk about that briefly well when you got there and you saw Maggie and Paul what where were the dogs the dogs were into kennels they would yet dogs were in the kennels they were wherever they were when law enforcement got there and you've seen pictures and they called Dale Davis to the stand and talk about the hose rolled up did you rolled the hose up no did you do anything down there at the kennels when you got there other than called 911 um no I I do know that I I was trying to find a flashlight I was trying to find a gun um other than those things no I didn't do it I didn't do anything at the kennel I didn't do anything with any hose I didn't do anything with any dogs was there anybody with you no all right keep going please it's a house okay and what is your name my name is Alex Murdock okay did you hear anything or did you come home and was anyone else supposed to be at your house no ma'am [Applause] please hurry so we're getting somebody out there to you foreign we just heard you say I should have known what are you referring to I said Paul Paul I should have known what were you referring to I was referring pawpaw got so many threats didn't take Serious think twice about so just telling him off all I should have known I don't specifically remember saying that but I can clearly hear myself say that what what kind of threats did you understand Paul is receiving I mean Paul got he got the most vile threats I mean the stuff that was on social media I mean it was you couldn't believe it you couldn't believe it it was so over the top truthfully we didn't think anything about it I mean it was just so crazy that you know we just I mean people talking about what he was going to get and how they were going to do this and get him and I mean it's it's stuff you really I mean you we disregarded it because so over the top thought it's so over the top keep going please okay what is her name Maggie evolved Maggie is her name yes ma'am okay when's the last time you talked to Maggie hour and a half ago probably two hours ago [Music] what [Music] okay he said about two hours ago you talked to them yes well you were asked the last time these saw them and you said hour and a half two hours ago and then she followed up two hours ago you just heard that I did hear that um and I said approximately to her question when was the last time you saw them Maggie and Paul right after I took the chicken from Bubba and the video we've seen as time stamp 844 p.m is that correct that's right so was it shortly after 8 44. it was and it wasn't long after that because you can hear when Bubba gets the chicken and it wasn't long after I took the chicken from it that I left and then you called 9-1-1 the records of that but you remember roughly 907 or right before 907. I mean I've seen the records and seen the um transcripts yeah and then this is and the records of this but this is some minutes into the conversation with 9-1-1 operator correct that's right knowing everything we know now I mean was it roughly an hour and a half the last time you saw them it was that would with the time of how long it took to get to this point how many minutes that is 10 10 to 10 how however many you can look exactly and see what point this is and know what time it is but it's between 10 and 10 15. and so I'd seen them around 8 45 a little bit after all right please keep going at all [Laughter] no I talked to her in person he talked to her in person okay [Applause] and you're sure they're not breathing is he moving now you're fine I know you said that she was shot in the head but what about your son nobody they're not going through this [Applause] what is your telephone number 942-1227 I'm going back to my house just to get a gun just in case I'm about did you go back to the house and get a gun I did and it's just a gun that that you got and how did you load this gun what I mean when did you load it with if anything that was gun as best I can remember I believe I got that gun off the pool table where you heard there was some other guns I think that gun was laying with that photo I'm not positive but I'm pretty sure it was on that pool table that would have been the first place I came to I'd know I was grabbing the first gun I could get I grabbed a handful of shells out of the um that I can get my hands on I know to I know the gun had a shell in it um that I loaded and I I know I had a few shelves so okay have you seen in this case where there was a 16 gauge shelf put in that gun I've seen in the records and I've seen and heard in the testimony I put a 16 gauge shell in the gun inside a 16 gauge shotgun it's not a 16 gauge shotgun 16 gauge shell in it I obviously didn't realize what I was doing I mean I know you can't put a 16 gauge shell in a 12 gauge gun and not I mean I've been hunting my whole life I know you can't do that that's it's not a mistake I would admit that's not a mistake I'd have made under any circumstances other than that night why did you go back to the house and get a gun I just didn't know I didn't know I mean solidly I mean it's just I I didn't know if somebody was still out there I don't know I guess I I didn't

that's what I said is it much farther than that I mean as you've heard in the testimonials 1100 and something feet but okay I said I was 100 yards and you you were wrong about your estimate I'm sure I was wrong okay keep going not not particularly really no man okay [Applause] what I know you're upset I don't want you to get a diamond and have a gun out whenever the officers get there okay I will

ass don't I mean you're told don't touch them how do you touch them by then yes and that way you told the 9-1-1 operator that is and um I mean can you say exactly six seven minutes when you actually touch them I know I touched Maggie um I touched Maggie several times but I mean I think I didn't I don't think I touched Papa but two times did you touch uh one or both of them before you got in the car and drove back to the house yes yeah one or both you know both all right keep going please sure okay and did your son I know you said that he had been threatened did your son make reports of this at all [Music] yes ma'am well you informed the 911 operator that that Paul had made reports of these threats what are you referring to I mean I I just know that it had been reported I don't know that I mean I don't believe there was any flight former police reports or um that type of thing but I mean it had been reported and I mean it was it was well known okay were you saying he had filed some official report when you said yes no I never thought I never I never thought there was a police report or some formal report like that no do you know whether or not he made some type of reported on campus oh I know he did what do you know I mean I know that there was a there was a time when he went to he was asked to come meet with um I can't even remember the gentleman's name now but I appreciated it so much and I never thought I'd forget it but it's a part of student Counseling Services yeah he was the dean of students um but anyway it reached out to Paul Paul and wanted to talk to him and um I mean at first we were concerned you know why did they why they want to talk to him and I mean even I believe I had Paul come talk to you about that because we were concerned what are they going to talk to him about but when Paul and Jim got there it turns out that it was really just I mean they were wanting to make sure he was okay but you know just it make sure he was okay and and know that you know they were aware of the threats or some level of threats and so yeah I mean it had already been reported to them keep going so what's your son's name people oh man I'm gonna call I I need to call some of my family do me a favor for me whenever you see the officer or the Medics because they're all coming to you can you put your gun in your vehicle for me absolutely okay on your vehicle so they can see you okay you got the flashers on for me okay okay how old is your son 22. okay all right we're getting about back to you okay all right so Alex um did you call family after you got off the call no on the with the operator yes who'd you call I know I called my brother Randy um I know I called my brother John and I know I tried to call roro well roro's not family but I called Randy and John and yeah I called Randy and John and then you just mentioned Roto Rogan we call him I called him row row why did you try to call Rogan um I mean Rogan Rogan's house was like I don't know as the crow flies maybe two and a half miles three miles um I mean Rogan was like family did you think he was the closest person yeah I just wanted somebody I wanted somebody to be out there have you seen Rogan's name on Paul's phone and any anyway that night no you call um broken answer no did you try try multiple times looking at these records I believe that I did but I believe some of those are um like the FaceTime calls that are to Rogan I mean I'm trying to call him I don't believe that was me actually I didn't FaceTime I mean I didn't FaceTime people so that I think that's either me trying to call him and hitting FaceTime or that's me hitting um buttons or hitting the phone and the uh State's exhibit 519 which is the condensed timeline done by uh agent rudofsky there's an indication Alec that at 10 2209 you opened a group text message from Michael Gunn stating she brought the heat for Miami Boys were you reading text messages from Michael Gunn right after you got off with the 911 operator I heard him ask that question I can promise you I wasn't reading any text messages there's also an entry out that says at 10 40 P.M you did a Google search or Safari browser search for Whaley's and Edisto while your wife and son are laying dead on the ground did you do that no Whaley's is a restaurant at Edisto that we ate at a lot of times we got take out from a lot of times so I'm assuming it was in my search history pulling up the restaurant and obviously was trying to call people or dialing and I I hit that I wasn't doing any Google searches and as one of the persons that you dialed that night of a wedding photographer well it's a guy named Brian White I saw that on the call log Brian White's a guy who was in my um what do you call it um contacts that is a um a videographer that I've used in cases I haven't used him in two years and he's a good guy but we're not personal friends so I certainly wasn't calling him so were you what does that indicate to you that those actions on your own what how do you account for that you know obviously they're unintentional I mean I'm doing something with my phone trying to call people but I'm not trying to call those people I'm not doing a Google search for any Whaley's restaurant and I'm certainly not reading any texts I want to ask you um for a break for about 10 minutes please do not discuss the police we'll take a 10 minute recess step down except for so much but they're um turns out there was a drop of blood on the steering wheel the Suburban do you know how that got there um I mean if it was fresh I put it there if it was not fresh I mean Maggie drove my car all the time but I assume it got there from me touching Maggie and then and then touching the steering wheel that night and then I think maybe they're possibly blood on this gun maybe not I mean did do you know if you got transferred blood on anything else if Maggie's blood's on that gun then I I put it there I mean Maggie I mean Maggie didn't really fool with guns other than put them up there's um did you submit to a GSR examination that night yeah that's what I was talking about earlier and that Brian wanted to testified about where your hands were swapped that's right and then you're your clothes were collected by I don't say to no one or someone else that's correct and um and turns out there's some GSR on your shirt and on your shorts and um did you handle this gun this this is uh yes this is item 22 that yes I had I basically had that gun with me until I put it up against my car um when when the um police officer I think it was Mr Green got there I put it against my car we're and I think Nolan had testified that this is you know one of the shotguns Paul liked to use it is we'll see meticulous about cleaning his guns Papa yeah no now when he cleaned it he was meticulous about it but it was far and few between when he actually cleaned them your um your shirt was went through testing and analysis and you were part of this case provided results of that were you not yes sir I mean I wouldn't provide it at the time I've seen them right getting seen all these records foreign did you get on your shirt High Velocity blood spider from being within a distance of a shooting mag near Palm there's no way that I had high velocity blood spatter on me had you seen reports that said that at one point in time I have seen reports that said that just to be clear were you anywhere in the vicinity when Paul and Maggie were shot I was nowhere near Paul and Maggie when they got shot after sled collected uh your clothing that night at the main residence that Moselle did you remember changing in remember what you changed into do I remember yeah yeah I know I changed clothes and I I've learned since then what I had on but I don't you don't remember okay I don't remember that at all but I understand I had on athletic shorts and a t-shirt sure uh and other people have talked about this I'm not going to repeat it but um where did you spend the night or where did you go to after leaving Moselle um when when you left for the evening we went to Almeda too we went to my mom and dad's house and we stayed there and who went with you um I believe that bus in Brooklyn and I rode together John Marvin might have been with us I know John Marvin stayed at Almeda with us I just don't know if he rode in the same car we rode in but I know I wrote with Buster in Brooklyn I know that for a fact and the the next morning what'd you do and I we're talking about daylight hours on June the 8th what what did you do and we basically got up and came back to Moselle do you remember roughly what time you got to Moselle I don't remember no I don't remember what time you know there's things I remember about that morning but I don't remember exactly what time we left and and now we'll get to this more detail but during that period of time is it hard to remember times what time things started stopped and how long things took I mean it's definitely hard to remember now looking at these timelines and all these records I mean it it sure helps but to to just do it off the top of my head is very difficult and we'll get to more of that um when you went back to Moselle um on the morning of June the 8th did you um do you know whether you took a shower there or took a shower Almeda or took a shower at all now I know we took a shower at Moselle but I did not take a shower before I left Almeda we basically got up and went to um Moselle Maggie's mom and dad they were there they were coming tell them see them we gotta we got up from Alameda and we left and we went to Moselle and you and do do you know do you even recall sled coming in and searching the house for anything on the eight I knew that um I mean I knew they were doing it yeah um I knew they would I knew they were doing it but I I don't remember I wasn't out in that gun room and I'll see all that video and all that but I knew sled yeah and was coming in there I mean we made I mean we we made the house available for them to come in there so I mean I can't tell you details but yeah I remember it did you at one point just tell slad they had the cart belongs to search anywhere anytime I told sled they could do anything anywhere anytime that they wanted to anything to do with me my property my cars even though I didn't own the cars I would get my Law Firm on the cars I would have the people they had full whatever they wanted they were welcome too and uh did you have any discussions with David Owen or anybody that sled about consenting the General Motors to get that off the car every time that I talk to David Owens I would ask him about getting OnStar data and GPS data from phones and why was it important to you to get OnStar data and GPS data from the phone to confirm where I was saying I went what I did GPS you know at that point in time I knew that Maggie's phone have been taken and I knew that my Suburban in my phone and Maggie Sloan never crossed paths and that was extremely important to me and I asked him about it every single time we talk every single time and um speaking of Maggie phone did you know her password to her phone yes I knew her password do you know her password to her computer yes did she know your password yes okay and when Maggie's phone was located um on the side of the road did did you provide sled the password to her phone I did I think I actually provided it to John Marvin Who provided it to sled but I'm the one who gave it to him right and your knowledge that um Maggie's have these location services on her phone she use them frequently all the time one of Maggie's things that she liked to do was there's that app called find my friends that you can see what other people are doing and they can see what you're doing Maggie loved me bus Papa Brooklyn um Grandma puppy Marion the three girls uh Lizzy and there were a few others but the people that were closest to her she had them all in her phone and she loved to to look at that phone and see where people are and she'd love to surprise you like let's say you're at um Walmart she looks on there and and she'd love to text you and get me a TV from Walmart or something you know like she she followed you and see where you were she used it all the time and so you know I just knew that there would be GPS data on Maggie's phone Alec when you're being interviewed on the night of June 7th and again on June the 10th what was your understanding outstanding is why they they were interviewing you why were you being interviewed on June 7th and June the 10th yes sir foreign what's the question again what is his understanding of why sled was interviewing him on the night of June the 7th and again on June the 10th and the basis for the objection 401 and 402 you're on what do you mean um relevance your honor his understanding is is not important what he said is important response well I can it goes to his his father he goes to his state of mind I mean that's what it goes to this thing did um why wasn't it why was it important to you to be able to get data from the Suburban data from your phone and data from Magnuson I knew at that point in time I knew since I was the person who found pop all the mags that I was a suspect I mean they kept talking about this circle um but I mean I knew that it was very important for me to find out to get that and what was your belief as to that information what would it have done for you there's no question in there that it would demonstrate that I couldn't have done this and when was the data from General Motors off that Suburban finally obtained it was either this past Saturday or Saturday before that according to what uh was said in this courtroom during this trial absolutely and uh to your knowledge was GPS data ever able to be located off Maggie's phone no no I mean not just to my knowledge it was not able to be gotten you know the testimony was in here that that it couldn't that it couldn't be gotten it only went back to um June the 9th everything before that was erased on Maggie's phone now when um starting June the 8th when that Mosely did a lot of people come to support you be with you on June the 8th on June the 8th like the next day right yes sir a lot of people and and you mentioned your Maggie's parents and and family came as well yes sir um from from that moment June 8th when folks family came and to Moselle and you met with them were were you left alone by any of your family members the rest of that week no I mean I I was attached to Buster at the hill all right but I mean what happened I wasn't what happened on June the 10th besides being interviewed by Celeste my dad died my dad passed where did you stay and with whom did you stay on the 9th of June the 8th the night of June the 9th the night of June the 10th on the night of June asked me to start on the eighth hey yes sir all right starting on the 8th I stay with Buster every night I stayed with Buster and as long as Brooklyn was there I stayed with Buster in Brooklyn um but we stayed with we I'm pretty sure that's beginning on the 8th I know the seventh we stayed at our meeting and I believe on the 8th we started staying at John Marvin in Lizzie's at Greenfield and how far how far is Greenfield from Almeda as the crow flies I mean it's no distance it's less than five minutes it's probably a couple of few minutes away and and who stayed there did John Marvin and his wife Liz stay there as well yes John and Lizzy um all right John and Lizzy stayed there and their kids bus in Brooklyn and I um I know Bubba and maymac stay there well Lizzy's mom and daddy stayed there um and my daddy's best friend and his wife came in there I believe they came before my daddy passed I know they came after he passed and stayed there and that how many nights do you recall staying there at Greenfield so I stayed at Greenfield about something seventh was a Monday I stayed Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday at Greenfield I know that for a fact and the Maggie and Paul's Funeral was Saturday is that right now I heard that in this courtroom say it was Saturday but to the memorial Services no their funeral was on Friday I was on Friday I know that for a fact too and then your father's funeral's on Sunday my father's funeral was on Sunday and it was my it was my father's funeral I forget the term but Sunday I mean that's when that's when we put up our mags that's my grade he didn't bear him when we had the service on Friday because I don't think they were done that's when we buried them this is along with my dad on Sunday and Alec what'd you do with the following week that Monday Tuesday Wednesday um starting to win now so the day after your dad's funeral all right Monday um I went to I went to um Grandma properties Somerville at some point Monday in the afternoon you mean what did I do when I got up that morning just yeah where did you stay we stayed at we stayed at Greenfield Sunday night so we woke up at Greenfield on Monday so and and Sunday night you were with the same family members your brother and Brooklyn and Buster and that's right and Liz Lizzy and Lizzy's mom and dad and I believe Donnie and Paula were still there but I can't remember when they left and then you went to uh Somerville with whom I believe I went to Somerville by myself but um I know bust in in the car by myself I can't remember Buster and I rode together but I think we might have had separate cars we probably we probably did ride together that first day I don't remember but I know I went to Somerville and Buster was in Somerville with me with grandma and papa t and and Somerville is where Maggie's parents live that's right that's um Maggie's mom and dad his grandma Maggie's mom's Grandma the Maggie's dad's Papa T and did you stay with them for a few days in Somerville I stayed with him longer in Somerville yeah I stayed with them um we stayed in Somerville Monday night Tuesday night Wednesday night and then we went to Greenville okay um and and what was in Greenville um my niece that was um she was having a baby and Maggie had just been she's just been so excited so please she's just so proud of those girls she was so excited about the baby and so the baby being born just became such a big deal to me it was the baby born yeah baby born beautiful little baby girl beautiful little mom and then did you go up to the lake after that we did well I mean we stayed at this Lake um kiwi that y'all heard about is really close to Greenville and so when I say we went to Greenville we really went to Lake kiwi but we went up there because you know and and um when she had the baby I want to say the baby might have gotten born shortly after we got there like Thursday but it I think it was Saturday before we could go and see them and and see my niece and see the baby so you know I mean that's where we went was to Lake Keowee but they live in Greenville on the morning of June 16th I think that was a Wednesday I think that's a Wednesday um where'd you wake up Somerville did you ever go to Almeda on that day on Wednesday yes sir I don't I don't believe so did you go to Almeda at 6 30 in the morning I know for a fact that I didn't go to Alameda at 6 30 in the morning I was in Somerville did I didn't go to Almeda at any point early in the morning I was in Somerville and I'm not positive about this but I know those I know I know they did a some I know in some of those records They have it was sometime before I left Somerville did you um did you ever take a during that week let's just start with that that week following your dad's funeral did you ever take a tarp into the house at Almeda a tarp a blue tarp the weak following my dad's funeral yes no I did not there's been um I don't know where it is in any boxes but this this blue rain jacket have you ever seen that before never seen it before never touched it and don't know anything about it did you um do you ever remember taking a tarp at any point in time over the house without me no I don't remember it I don't remember taking a tarp over there but you know I mean Shelley's got something in her mind about that and there may have been some point but I certainly don't remember it and it certainly wasn't anytime around my dad's funeral or the weeks following I think we we talked briefly about um about your recollection of times and and I just want to play um Doug from State's exhibit 517 which is the August 11th interview starting at five minutes and 52 seconds if you could pull that clip up and and I want you to listen to this now okay tell me again what it is August 11th interview it's okay five minutes and 52 seconds all right I'm gonna go to five minutes and 52 seconds foreign [Music] what time did you go to the office uh uh we have been to a ball game that weekend um I don't remember exactly what time it would have been uh somewhere between 8 30 and 9 30 probably 10 o'clock maybe at the latest something like that Al you on this tape were you being asked when you went to work on the on the Sabbath yes and you said 8 30 to 9 30 in the morning and then I think said 10 o'clock at the latest is that correct no it wasn't now I've seen all these records what does it look like what time you went to work on the on the seventh a little afternoon all right um if we'll go to the uh Doug States exhibit 243 which is the June 10 interview you know Mr Griffin on that same date uh also if you play that thing and I don't know if it's right then but if you play that further I also told him the best way to see exactly when I went in that door is to go and get my information from my Law Firm and I told them that they'll you know we have a you know how things are electronic now where you don't have a key you have a key card and um and you have a key card in your wallet and so when you use it it creates a like all this other stuff a digital footprint and I've told David Owens that he could go get it from my office and was that a common response of yours when you're asked about specific times that you would give them you know your best estimate but you would Point them to where they could find the most accurate data yes sir you did that more than once yes sir okay so um if we've got the June 10th interview which is State's exhibit 243 and and Doug I'd like to go to nine minutes and 59 seconds and here that you're being asked when did Paul arrive at Moselle I have a clock range a little bit it was it was broad daylight when we were it wasn't dust dark or late okay you know and we rode uh you know we just rode around we wrote around so did you tell them on June 10th that Paul got there five o'clock Tom appearing yes sir uh yes sir I obviously did and was that incorrect yes sir it was incorrect okay and what what time did you looking at the records now what time did it look like Paul actually got there and looking at the records it's clear that he got there sometime around seven o'clock at some point in time you have a conversation with Shelley Smith about you know how long you were over at Almeda on the night of June the 7th do you remember you know I don't distinctly remember having a conversation with her about how long I was over there but I know that I told Shelly Smith that um sled was gonna come and talk to her and that I'd appreciate it if she would talk to them and that she just needed to tell him the truth and um did you take extra care not to talk to people that you knew celeb would be talking to absolutely and why is that after this boat wreck that you've heard so much talk about in this courtroom that were social media newspaper um I mean it went deeper than that but I mean there were so many so much talk about how I you know fixed Witnesses and and structured the investigation just things that were totally false that were absolutely baseless but it was said repeatedly repeatedly and it was reported repeatedly how I'd done this and would this witness and influence this police officer and all these things so I wasn't taking any chances I want to um ask you about you can take that down though thank you ask you about the August August August 11th interview um with David Owen at the sled office and I think here in Walterboro do you remember that August 11th absolutely had you requested at that meeting I've been requesting what I'd really been requesting is some information I've been begging David Owens to come meet with me and specifically I wanted Grandma Papa t there were so many questions that I couldn't answer and I've been begging him to meet with me and to meet with grandma and papa t I've been begging him for weeks and weeks and did uh we enter the meeting on August 11th did you think that's what it was for to give you an update yes and um at the conclusion of the meeting they let you know that that you're their Prime Suspect Mr Griffin I'll rephrase it I think that by the conclusion of the meeting did they make it known to you that that you were suspect oh there's no question about that absolutely now he used a lot of I mean you hear it to talk about how I'm in this circle and he can't get me out and this and that but there's no doubt in my mind there was no question in my mind what was going on and the um and during that meeting did they show you the Snapchat Snapchat video of you uh trying to stand up the fruit tree yes and were you questioned about what clothing you were wearing and I can't remember this I can't remember if he showed me the whole video or he showed me a picture of it um but I was definitely showed that information I was definitely showing those clothes in that meeting on August the 11th and and what clothes were you wearing the same ones you see in and do you remember what kind of pants it was khaki pants and what kind of shirt it's a button-down short sleeve button down I call it a dress shirt but short sleeve button-down dress shirt like like shirt you've got there but just just like this but short sleeve and it was colored and what color was it blue blue with some blue stripes and we question about when you changed out of those clothes I was and um did you have a follow-up did you have a conversation after that meeting with celeb with Blanca about what you were wearing that day absolutely and what was the purpose of the conversation with block well they made an issue about that in that meeting and I asked Blanca about those clothes that that I had on earlier that day do you ask her specifically about the blue shirt I asked her specifically about all the clothes okay what I asked Blanc about specifically was did she remember getting my clothes after she came back um when she came back to Moselle did she remember getting my clothes it's specifically what I asked her right and why were you asking her those questions because on August the 11th they had made an issue about me wearing still wearing those clothes not having changed clothes when I was in that Snapchat video that's why I went to Blanca did they ever ask you on August 11th whether um I'm asking for those clubs can you produce the clothes do they ask you that no they did it have they ever asked you for those clothes no as far as my understanding goes my clothes were never an issue in this case until y'all figured out as my lawyers figured out that there was no blood sugar on me sir is that objection your honor 401 402 and Beyond in speculation Mr Griffin it's a matter of public record it's a matter of public record what is it um the issues with the shirt and the blood test it's a matter of public records found in this case the objection's overall I'm well aware that my clothes never became an issue in this case until my lawyers proved that this blood spatter that they said I had on my shirt for my wife and my son was a lie and that there was no blood on my shirt and once they filed the documents and they proved that that was a lie all of a sudden the clothes I was wearing back on that day became an issue and that's in the weeks leading up to the stride no Alec after the Maggie and Paul were murdered on June 7th and 8th where did you stay and where did you keep clothes right say that again please where were you staying overnight let me ask you this did you ever spend another night at Moselle after June 7th never spent another night at Mozelle why not I couldn't they don't want to do it okay where were you staying and we talked about the the days and weeks the week afterwards but where were you staying when you got back from the lake Poe and Greenville I stayed all right so when I got back from Greenville so that would be the all right be um so the first week I've been doing my dad's funeral then all right so that'd be the second week or so after we I know bus and I um I stayed with grandma and papa t as much as I could um you know um stayed with um I stayed with my brother Randy a lot um I stayed with my brother John a lot um bus and I stayed at Edisto a little bit but at the beginning I stayed with I really stayed with either my brother Randy and his wife Christy or I stayed with my brother um John and his wife Lizzy and basically at that time Buster was doing excuse me buster was Buster was mustard worked for Wild Wing at that time and they've been so kind to him and gave him he was they let him be off just for just just ridiculous amount of time they were so good to him so he stayed with me when he had to go back to work he would stay at my brother John and Lizzy's because it was close so I would stay with Randy and Christy um in Hampton when Buster was there I would almost always go to John and Lizzie's when Buster was there I would go to John and Lizzy sometimes when um Usher wasn't there but I I was Johnny Parker one of my partners had a guest house his mother-in-law had lived in when she was sick that's really it's right at the foot of Randy's drive it's a hundred yards 70 yards from Randy's house and I was going to move into I was going to move into that house until we figured out where I could live so I had clothes there I had clothes at Randy's I had clothes at John Marvin's I had clothes at chichessi which is I think you heard Buster talk about chichester's like where we went to the to the river and I had clothes there um I had clothes in Somerville and I still had clothes at Moselle so your clothes yes sir last question no this uh so you were your clothes spread out a lot of different places thank you a little break for lunch and return at in an hour and 15 minutes please do not discuss the case recess let's see it's 125 what's that 240. and recessed with 240. thank you foreign okay foreign thank you you may proceed you're on Mr murdick I want to uh go to June the 7th 2021 and you're meeting with Gene seconder okay do you remember meeting my second year I do and what was the meeting about uh Judy came up to me and uh asked me previously Annette Griswold had come to me and asked me about uh the fee check in the ferris case and Jeannie was coming to me and saying that she was following up on that if she didn't she wouldn't be doing her job and and asked me some questions let me ask you which I understood briefly um the ferris fee what what originally happened to it the pmped portion of the ferris fee I mean originally yes sir did it come to you directly yes should have come to you directly no did um when when Ms second year asked you about the where the fee was what'd you tell her I can't remember exactly what I told her the the conversation got interrupted very quickly but I told Jeannie that the funds were in Chris Wilson's account and and nothing to worry about I wouldn't I didn't know where the mix-up came from what what was your level of concern about Miss secondary inquiry to you on June the 7th there was some level of concern because she's asking me about money that I took that I wasn't supposed to have so certainly I had some level of concern but it it wasn't it wasn't a very big concern um as you heard testimony earlier at some point Annette Griswold had sent Chris Wilson an email something to the effect of Alec thinks he has more expenses or something like that seeking financial documents from Chris Wilson when Chris Wilson got I wasn't copied on that but when Chris Wilson got that Chris Wilson called me up and he's like you know what is this all about uh pardon what's that objection rule Zeta 1 and 802. response in your honor I'll I'm not asking for what Chris Wilson said and I'll I'll move on I accept the objection um were you concerned about Chris Wilson opening his trust account records to um your Law Firm no I was not concerned about that at all and why were you not concerned I knew that one of the people that Chris Wilson as you heard Chris Wilson and I were very close we talked every day I I did work with him all the time and I mean he was one of the people closest to me in the whole world I I knew everything about him and I knew he was going through one of his partners and he and his partner had split up a partner and an associate had moved to a firm in Charleston the partner was going through a divorce and the wife of the partner was trying to get Chris Wilson's trust documents in that case to find out money her husband got didn't have anything to do with Chris and I or anything it totally had to do it but I knew that Chris Wilson was not going to send any financial documents to my Law Firm at least at that time and at least not anytime soon so while I'm sure it registered with me that I got to deal with this at that particular time it wasn't anything that was a big deal was there an immediate urgency to the situation on June the 7th no and I believe there's there's second year testified about your conversation with her you learned that your dad was going back in the hospital that's correct uh there was a text I can't remember if that text came from my brother Randy or my brother John but they were the ones that were taking my dad back to the hospital that day and whichever one was with him believe it was John was with him at the hospital but I know Randy was really missing treatment he send those documents the bottom line is we got a text saying we knew my dad was really sick he had cancer and he couldn't breathe and there was a big issue about whether his inability to breathe was coming from an obstruction caused by the cancer which was the worst case scenario and that's what it ended up being ultimately and that's what he died from but this particular text was saying okay we're putting him back in the hospital the doctor thinks it's pneumonia and which was you know I mean pneumonia is never a good thing but when compared to cancer at that time pneumonia that was a good thing to learn that on the seventh word the information you had did I mean you believed at that time the prognosis was pretty positive for your father well it was better than the alternative I I'm not going to say it was good but it was better than it was better than the alternative and what we previously thought it was it didn't stay good very long but it definitely was better do you uh know whether or not you you told Mr secondary that um that your dad's condition was terminal on the seventh do you know do you remember whether you said that or not uh no I wouldn't have said that at that time um and when I you know Genie as soon as the thing comes through that my dad's going into Hospital Jeannie and I as you heard I mean she stopped a meeting we stopped it it lasted a couple minutes now my dad's going into hospital and the very next day we learned that he's terminal and I'm I'm just sure that a year or the amount of time that's gone by Genie assumed she was terminal he was terminal speculation instructions on the rules um Mr murdick the uh uh on June the 7th did you believe that your financial House of Cards was about to crumble on June the 7th yes sir absolutely not um had had you had and I think there's documented evidence State introduced had you had reached out to Russell Lafitte at Palmetto State Bank about extending a line of credit on the Moselle property yeah I had reached out to him I can't remember the date of that text but it was fairly recently I I had reached out to Russell and on June 7th did you have equity in the Moselle property that or you and or you and Maggie had equity in that Moselle property sure and I mean Moselle was fully in Maggie's name okay um so but yes there was equity in Moselle in looking at the documents that had been used there was a million eight hundred thousand dollars owed there was an appraisal for 3.3 million without Timber value and so on 1700 Acres you know I don't know what the timber value was but if you just said a thousand dollars an acre that'd be another million something dollars in value over and above the appraisal I doubt the timber value was that high I'm just using that as an example but if it was 500 it'd be another eight hundred thousand dollars so you know there was several million dollars in equity in that Moselle property all right and did uh did you have equity in the Edisto Beach House yes and around June 7. how much Equity did you have in Edisto Beach if I remember the records correctly there was about 250 000 dollars um owed on that house and whatever the value was at the time I think I I think there's a contract for just under a million dollars so 700 and something thousand dollars did um the maggies death make it more difficult to obtain financing immediately after the murder around June 7th hey Maggie's yes also because the entire Moselle property was a hundred percent in Maggie's name the Edisto property was 50 percent in magazine so I was only a half owner so with Maggie all I had to do is get her to sign the documents which she always did I mean she didn't question finances so I mean she signed the papers when Maggie wasn't here there was a state issues I could I couldn't go and sign the papers like I would normally go and get a loan so yeah I couldn't okay oh no was there a hearing scheduled in the boating lawsuit where you were defendant set for that week yes do you remember what day it was scheduled for well I mean I've heard the testimony and I knew I'm sure I knew at the time it's June the 10th Thursday June the 10th right um what was your level of concern about that hearing coming up on June the 10th about that hearing yes sir um my level of concern about that hearing was about the venue motion that was coming up which um now what do you mean by venue venue motion is venue is where a civil lawsuit is pending and so there's laws and and rules that govern where you can bring a case there's laws and rules that govern how certain parties a defendant or a plaintiff can go about trying to move it from one place to another so in this case the plaintiffs the beach family had filed suit in Hampton County Parkers was trying to move venue to Beaufort County and I wanted the case to stay in Hampton County um and and really that was my only thought about I wasn't doing the legal work on those I was a party in that case I wasn't I mean Danny Henderson was primarily representing me personally John tiller and Amy Bauer were representing me personally and Dawes cook was representing me personally and those are the guys that were doing the legal work so you know um I I wasn't actually doing that work but what I was concerned about was the venue motion I had already done what I had to do for the financial motion and Danny Henderson was on me about getting him a financial statement because let's stop so it was a motion to compel and seek a lot of financial records from you is that correct absolutely and were you concerned that your house Financial house was going to be opened up for the world as a result of that hearing no I've been a plainish lawyer like Mr Tinsley that sat here we do the same exact thing in my Law Firm the the guys in my Law Firm are some of the best lawyers that I've ever known and they're definitely some of the best lawyers in the state handling some of the biggest cases that have ever gone on in this state in my 27 years of practicing plaintiffs always are trying to look and get financial documents of corporate defendants of you know those type things in my 27 years I've never been able to get a judge to order anything more than a net worth statement prior to getting into a phase at trial so early on in the case I am not aware of I personally have never despite trying repeatedly have never been able to get a judge to order the kind of information that Mark Tinsley was saying he was seeking what were you working on a document for that upcoming hearing yes and what was that a financial statement a financial statement lists your assets in your liabilities and had you reached out to uh Jenny secondary later that the day on the Sabbath to get your current balance of your retirement account you know I don't remember doing that but that certainly be something that I I did and because I would I know I'd have to have that for that financial statement and the document that I prepared was what Mark Ball talked about that he found later in my office and it was tight it was handwritten ready to be typed up by you know because of the charges against Paul I was so I kept everything very close in the civil case it was Danny in his office um it was doing it and I had that document prepared handwritten in the neatest handwriting that I could make because a secretary other than mine a paralegal other than mine was going to be the person who was going to put those that financial information into the final document and that's the document that Mark Ball talked about that he found on my desk whenever it was that he found it so that was what was going to be if necessary what was going to be used Thursday Alex Jerry's heard a about testimony of you stealing client funds did you do that I did did you still um would divert that Pharisee away from the law firm I did um how did you get in such a financial predicament that LED you to steal money it wasn't you sure how I let myself get where I got but it came from you know I battled that addiction for so many years I was spending so much money on pills I got in the spot I couldn't now what type of addiction are you referring to my addiction is to is to opiate painkillers and when specifically oxycodone Oxycontin and when did you first become dependent or addicted to opioids oxycodone or opiates in general opiates in general not quite sure of the exact date but I can give you a time frame I I hurt my knee really bad playing football in college and I had a knee surgery and the the Medical Science at the time was such that the the surgery didn't work bottom line so it it just didn't last So within a couple of years of that I started having a lot of knee troubles and ultimately I had to have a a couple of surgeries but um this this the the last surgery I had was I think around 2000 and two or four and I think it was around four so I would have started taking hydrocodone a couple of years before that and I took hydrocodone got addicted to that very quickly um I continued taking that for a long time I would I'd I'd force myself off of it wean myself off of it I'd go back to it um I I just I battled out for a long time and after a while I was taking so much of that I moved on to oxycodone and um you know I'm guessing that was around 2000 that transition was around 2000 eight nine something like that um and of course you know it just it just escalates it escalates it escalates did you um receive treatment or go to detox on occasion I did how many times um that I went to detox or that I detoxed well let's start with going to a detox facility um I've been to a detox facility three times when was the first time um December of 2017. okay and um before December 2017 had had you tried to detox at home I tried to detox every way I could when Maggie would help me go ahead yeah when you um when you went in to a was an inpatient facility the detox is the the formal detoxes that I went to in December 2017. yes it was in in it was impatient and all three formal detoxes that I've done have been at the same facility called Sunrise detox in Atlanta Georgia audio tape of a telephone conference with sled agents was that where you were during that meeting with Mr harpulina that's correct um the first time you went to the detox in Atlanta how long of a stay is that did you stay seven days is the um opiate detox programs and is there a difference between detox and Rehab yes what's the difference uh detox is the uh the act of getting the drugs out of your system getting to the point where okay there is no longer a physical dependency all right and that's a big difference then the rest of the dependency but the physical dependency is supposed to be gone after seven days so in other words the um I mean there are so many things opiate withdrawal is Venus is hard um but supposedly at the end of seven days you don't have those physical symptoms like I don't want to be too graphic but you know you're sick you throw up you um you have terrible diarrhea you sweat like you're running a marathon um you can't hold your legs still you you can't lay down now like what I'm talking about the legs moving that goes away after about 24 hours so you know after about 24 hours you can lay down again and and maybe sleep some but you sweat you throw up yeah well I mean you just have there's there's so many issues but after seven days those are supposed to be over that's what detox is the detoxification of your body and what's rehab rehab is the period that you go to learn how to stay off you know you supposedly off after detox rehab is where you get help staying off and uh before September of 2021 had you ever gone to that second stage of rehab no so in June excuse me December 2017 how long did it take you to relapse once you got home from detox not long at all I mean he's still going through and that his physical dependency is gone you still have I mean you're still so sick I mean you just is that something you've been battling for quite some time as long as I can remember how long have you been drug-free opioid free 535 days and I'm very proud of that foreign questions about Labor Day weekend 2021 okay do you remember being confronted by your Law Firm sure I did and what were you confronted about stealing money and did you admit your misconduct to your law partners well to one of my law partners and one of my and my brother and my law Partners Danny and Randy um yeah I mean did a minute and they they learned about a fake Forge account did you you've met the fake Forge account yes I did and did you tell them about your opioid struggles opioid addiction I told him about my addiction yes sir um to your knowledge for any of your law Partners aware of your addiction not just to my knowledge I'm certain that they were not aware of my addiction how would you characterize your your opioid use your addiction severe moderate then or now no in 20 in 2020 2021 let's I mean I I don't know how I would have characterize it then after going to rehab and learning um more of the things I've learned um really talking to addicts about experiences I mean I I will tell you that my addiction was extremely extremely bad how are you able to function or were you able to function yes it's able to function you were able to practice law yes and were you successful practicing law while you were predicted opioids level yes sir I was successful I mean I after you were confronted on Labor Day weekend 2021 did did you resign or were you forced to resign from a law firm absolutely and then on um Saturday September the 4th you remember what happened that day Saturday September 4th yes sir I remember and what happened God when I woke up well let's start out after you met with Chris Wilson did you meet with Chris Wilson I met with Chris Wilson at my mom's and dad's house in Almeda and and did you lay it out for Chris Wilson your opioid addiction and your misconduct I I definitely laid out my uh addiction I definitely gave him some details about um monies that I had taken I didn't give him we didn't go into all the details about all of it but I certainly was very candid with him about the things that involved him had had you already just contacted the the detox facility um before you met with Chris Wilson on the fourth I believe that we had already um at that point I believe that we had already already uh spoken to the guy that I knew from sunrise and made arrangements for me to go there on Monday okay and um I know we had Arrangement City to go down on Monday and I I I'm sure we had to have had it by then because I went to the hospital shortly after that so yes and and did you reach out to Blanca to get your insurance information I did yeah and for what purpose um because I was going to use my insurance at uh detox and Rehab to help pay for it and and what would what was your immediate plans um after I mean for the day after you met with Chris Wilson did you have plans to do anything have any other meetings on that Saturday I wanted to go and meet with Corey Fleming who was another lawyer who was affected by the things I did and did you and a good friend did you go meet with Corey Fleming no what what'd you do instead I'd give him my when when I gave my pills to my brother Randy and Danny I think I gave them to Randy but I'd taken I took a I took a lot of pills because I knew I wasn't going to be taking any more so um Randy had my pills I had to get some from him the night before but I only got a small amount um I I could tell you know I I wasn't taking anything near like what I had been taking so I knew it was coming um and I called someone to bring me more pills and um before I believe before I met with Chris Wilson and did you you meet this did the person you called bring you more pills um you know I don't know if he brought me more pills or not because by the time I met with him um after meeting with Chris and after you know the starting of the withdrawals I changed my plans and what what was the change in plans not to get pills from him anymore and instead I asked him to shoot me did you ask him to shoot you as a sympathy Ploy or did you want as a sympathy boy yes sir why are you asking me to shoot you what was it what was the end goal and you're that you wanted to accomplish I meant for him to shoot me so I'd be gone and who is this who did you ask to do this Eddie Smith and did he in fact shoot you he did and where where where was that located not your gunshot but where were you shot in Hampton and Colony County where where were you it's Hampton County it's um it's right on the bonus soccer Hatchi road that runs right along the suckahachie river um and and why did you want to be gone I mean I knew all this was coming to a head I knew how humiliating it was going to be for my son um I mean I've been through so much foreign in the bad place that I was seemed like a better thing to do I don't think that way now thankfully but I did at the time did you have life insurance on you oh yeah I had a lot of life insurance and who was the beneficiary um Maggie was the beneficiary how much life insurance did you have I had 12 million dollars I had a four million dollar policy in the 12 million and an 8 million dollar policy a total of 12. did you ever have any life insurance on Mac no never having life insurance on Paul no Alex will you tell this jury about Maggie and your relationship with her foreign she was just as beautiful inside as she was outside and um I mean she was so adventurous I mean she you couldn't tell her something was good or bad and she wanted to find out for herself she wanted to do it see it experience it uh on her own and form her own opinion um she was devoted um those two boys buster Paul me mean I mean she made sure we didn't want for anything ever um fun playful I mean she had a laugh that um you know you didn't even have to know what was funny if you heard her laugh you would laugh um you know she had a slope playful look where she'd smile at you and bite her lip I can't do it but I mean when she just do it it just melts you um you know she was such a lady such a feminine person a girl but then she had two boys and I mean she didn't grow up in the swamp and in the country riding four-wheelers and hunting and fishing and I mean she she changed everything she she um she um I mean she became a boy's mom I mean her life became bald and riding four-wheelers and I mean doing those things now don't get me wrong she was still 100 girl and you heard Marianas at me she loved to do those things with her nieces but I mean she threw herself into her boy's life I mean you know she never took not working uh for granted I mean she maybe she might not have worked but I promise you she worked and she worked make sure me and Paul and Buster had everything um you know she um she wanted a big family and pregnancy just didn't suit her pregnancies were so hard I would leave her in the mornings and she'd be sick I'd come home and check on her and she'd be sick I come back at the end of the day and she'd be sick I mean she was so sick all the time with both those boys and and um when we had pawpaw Maggie got in trouble and Paul Paul got in trouble and um just pregnancy didn't suit her so we decided that you know we would just have the two boys and you know I just think hard it was on her just made her love those boys so much more and she did but she was the kind of person Maggie you know she could put on the most elegant ball gown and go to the governor's mansion and hang out with you know the most affluent people whatever or she could come down to you know she could go to um a food bank in Hampton or Walterboro and fit in everybody at both places would say when she left and that Maggie she's a good one she's just a special person would you ever do anything to harm Maggie I would never hurt me um will you tell a jury about Paul please and your relationship with me and Papa I mean Papa was just the brightest he was the Bryce he's the most inquisitive young man he wanted to be a part of everything if you were working I can remember as a little boy you'd be working on something it didn't matter what it was his little head was going to come in there it's his nose in there to see what you were doing um he was a man's man he was a hundred percent country boy he was tough I mean he he could hunt anything he could catch any fish he could run any piece of equipment he could use any tool um I mean he could do anything he at 22 years old he could do so many things I mean he took care um of so many and he was so tough but [Music] on the other hand he had a side to him it was just so sweet I mean he wouldn't come home but he wouldn't go check on his grandparents he wouldn't go near Somerville where he wouldn't go out of his way check on his grandparents um you know to be such a tough person he would get all his buddies and get on a boat and go watch a sunset let me 22 year old people you know this stuff like that I mean he was such a special boy um he he cared about people he was fiercely fiercely loyal he was so misrepresented in the media I mean never never an accurate story told about what he was and I'll challenge you right now I I would challenge everybody in this room to go find somebody somebody that knew Papa who really knew him that did not have an ulterior motive that would say something negative about him and that challenge everybody who can hear me now to do that I mean Paul was that kind of person if you knew him he would help you and he would be glad to help you um you know I thought Mark Ball made a good point when he said you know pawpaw might not have he might not have quite found his place yet Paul was ADD ADHD and so he would jump around from thing to thing a lot but there's absolutely no question in my mind whatsoever that Papa would have found whatever that thing was that he was going to do and whatever that ended up being he was going to be one of the best at it that that you've ever known and I'll tell you one more thing I didn't even know this when Paul was alive but foreign excuse me um excuse me um when when when they were doing his eulogy I gave the names of some of his friends and he had a real cute friend that they were just friends but some cute little girl Maggie adored I didn't know her very well but Maggie did Maggie adored her but they talked to her and and pawpaw they look we learned this from her Julianne and at 22 years old learned I mean pawpaw would tell his friends be present appreciate Where You Are the things you have and the people around you I think a lot of that came from it hurt Paul so bad when Mallory died but I mean 22 year olds do you know that think that way be present appreciate things around you at 22 years old he's the most special boy do you love Paul that I love him like no other he and Buster you love Maggie for more than anything love Maggie from the first time we went out did you kill Maggie no I did not kill Maggie I did not kill Paul I would never hurt Maggie and I would never hurt Paul ever under any circumstances thank you please answer any questions it'll take a 10 minute recess please do not discuss the case foreign did not discuss your testimony during the recess 10 minutes thank you foreign thank you cross-examination Police Court [Music] Mr murdai let's start with a few things I think we can agree on all right you agree that the most important part of your testimony here today is explaining your life for a year and a half that you were never down at those kennels at 8 44. would you agree with that I I think all of my testimony is important Mr Waters would you agree that that's an important part of your testimony sure all right and would you also agree that the first time that law enforcement officers that you've talked to and the prosecution and here in open court ever heard you say that you lied about being in the kennels was today in this court yes I'm aware of that you would agree with that yes sir all right all right all this time later this is the first time you've ever said that yes sir and he would agree to me with me that for years you were stealing money from clients yes sir I agree with that and that you were stealing from your Law Firm yes sir I agree with that and that had been going on since at least 2010. I'm not sure the exact date but it's been going on a long time I'll agree with that what's your best guess the other day I'm not sure I haven't I don't take a dispute with 2010 I just don't know that for sure all right sure about a lot of things but you don't know that is that correct I'm fine with that date Mr Waters I don't have any reason to dispute it I'm just not certain of it all right let's let's just keep on things that we may be able to agree about and let's talk first about your family's Legacy here in the legal profession okay talk about anything you want to it's good uh tell me about your great grandfather was he the solicitor for the very circuit that we're in yes sir and what was his name Randolph murdick senior what did he go by you know Randolph Randolph and did you ever get to know him or did he pass before Oh no sir he got killed in 1940. and how long was he solicitor 20 years 20 years yes sir and then your grandfather who was that Randolph murdick Jr and did he go about what did he go by Buster that's who Buster is named after Mike and was he solicitor yes sir he was the solicitor for 40 6 46 years from 1940 he took over when my great-granddaddy got killed and he served until 1986. he's the longest servant prosecutor in the country and you knew him obviously well he was your grandfather correct oh I knew him extremely well and loved him dearly idolized them did you not yes you know so he was the chief prosecutor for all that time as well is that correct yes sir and then your father Mr Randolph he became solicitor not long after that is that correct when my grandfather retired because you weren't allowed to be solicitor after age 72 my dad took over filled his unexpired term and then he ran and he became the chief prosecutor for this this area right here as well yes sir and how long was he solicitor from 1986 until 2006. until 2006. yes sir actually worked the case with them about a guy killed a trooper it's a fine fine man excellent lawyer yes he was and he was an excellent lawyer right yes sir that's a big part of your your family Legacy and your heritage it's so ingrained around here is that history of being the chief prosecutor and being part of the central part of the legal Community is that correct would you agree with that my family's been a central part of the legal Community yes sir I agree with that and not only just the central part of the legal Community but the chief prosecutor for this area since 1910 I think up until 2006. 1920 1920 2006 1910 is when my great-grandfather started the law firm Law Firm yes sir all right so 1920 to 2006 correct that's correct and I'm broken Shane of being the chief prosecutor here correct that's correct and then you went to law school as well is that right yes sir and when did you uh graduate from Law School 1994 1994 and did you ever become a full-time solicitor no sir and you so you went into private practice I think with Molson is that right yes sir 1994 to the former Law Firm that no longer exists because of your activities correct I started in 1990 question if you would please first what was your question my question was that you started first with moss and  go ahead and answer that one yes that's correct and then you went to the law firm that doesn't exist anymore that started in 19 but it doesn't exist anymore because of your activities correct that's correct and as part of that of your practice you're a trawler correct that's correct successful trial Ward I don't know about your adjective but I I was you know I I guess so yes sir did you make millions of dollars in legal fees yes sir but you won't tell this jury that's successful well if that's if that's the criteria yes sir I was successful well you won cases correct I did win cases subtle cases sure I settle cases heard your former law partner say that you were successful lawyer I did hear some of them say that I think you even became president of the troll Lawyers Association is that right that's correct and when was that I'm not sure in the exact year but it would have been uh in the 2015 Range 2014 15 16 somewhere in there and in that role you were kind of uh the president of the association of people who do trial plants work right yes sir to do jury trials correct well that's part of it right yes sir that's that's part of it that's part of sitting down looking jurors in the eyes and giving a close enough is that right yes and what kind of cases did you normally do what what just generally what subject matter I I did all kinds of cases I did cases that I mean I I handled some very big cases um you know I had a lot of cases where you know somebody their cable company was billing them twenty dollars more than they should have been and I handled everything from that to the big cases and everything in between all right so the big cases tell me about those those were typically plaintiffs work all plaintiffs were correct for your big cases yes okay and plaintiff's work is where or there would be say for example uh automobile or truck accidents correct all right some of it all every big case I ever had was the automobile no and I mean no sir not all of them were automobile wrecks or many of them sure and if they let's say it your your plaintiff collided with uh like a UPS truck or a tractor trailer or something like that you've had cases like that correct I have and they led to very big recoveries is that correct the UPS case that I handle yeah yes sir all right and as a part of that um developing those types of cases you were involved in investigating the facts of the case correct yes and you were involved in gathering let's say Telemetry data from automobiles correct Telemetry data like you presented in this courtroom this week yeah you never did that I've never had a case specifically where the type data that y'all have presented in this case that I've used but I've had data from automobiles I've had from there essentially their computer own star data I've had data from the Black Box you know but specifically Telemetry data I don't believe that I've ever had one of those but OnStar and black box data correct um more so the Black Box event recorder I mean many times in a wreck the the event recorder will go back and tell you things leading up to the wreck sure So and I've been in numerous cases where those were involved and you've had cases where cell phone evidence was relevant to your case sure people's call logs are relevant to your case I have had those cell tower location was relevant to your case yes computer evidence was relevant to your case I'm sure I have yes and once you start with the law firm August of September of 1998 and you've been doing essentially that kind of work more or less up until September of 2021 that's right that's correct to the point where you Rose to be the president of The Trial Lawyers Association I was the president of Trial Lawyers Association in around 2015 as we discussed so can we agree now on successful I mean by those criteria I was successful certainly I mean we've talked about a lot of my flaws here today too do I feel like I was successful no sir not sitting here today I don't but if if you want to use that term and on those criterias I don't have any problem with you saying at that time it looked like I was successful do you think people viewed you as a successful lawyer um I'm sure there were a lot of people that did you think people viewed your family as very prominent I believe that there were a lot of people that did yes sir and did you think that a lot of people viewed you and your family as very prominent in the legal Community here I never thought of myself as prominent if you thought if people viewed you that way let me ask you at the time that I think people viewed me that way yeah prior to everything happening no I I don't think that I thought people viewed me as prominent no sir I mean like a big shot no sir I don't think that what about your family he is prominent in this community prominent as in it's not a hard question well I'm just not sure you know I think my family was very well thought of I think my family was respected I think my family helped a lot of people um I'm not challenging you on anything I'm just getting you to agree what seems to be a basic fact would you agree with that would what did my family helped a lot of people and was well thought up if if that's what you mean by that yes sir and that your family had a very long association with law enforcement yes sir and you had a long association with law enforcement yes yes um by association I assume you're talking about friendships yeah but not only not only just friendships but also professional as well correct as a professional associations with law enforcement as a prosecutor or as a civil attorney okay let's talk about civil did you have associations with them in civil case sure I mean as we discussed a lot of cases that I handled were cases or might be a train wreck or a tractor Trail but there are a lot of Highway patrolmen involved there were a lot of local law enforcement involved so yeah we dealt with a lot of law enforcement in the Civil practice all right and then you also mentioned that you were a prosecutor as well correct I was a volunteer assistant solicitor uh did your uh did you or your family or your Law Firm ever have events or parties or social Affairs in which uh the law enforcement community in this area was invited I mean sure we the the law firm itself didn't really sponsor things like that but there would be occasions where one of us in the law firm and certainly we all had a lot of friends in law enforcement and they were always invited okay and it's a simple point you had a lot of friends in law enforcement your family and you had a long association with the law enforcement community in this circuit is that correct Association being friendships and working relationships absolutely okay all right well let's talk about being a prosecutor when did you become an assistant solicitor I believe that I became an assistant solicitor when I moved from Beaufort to Hampton so that would have been September sometime around September 1998 might have been a little bit after that but sometime did you get a badge when you came an assistant solicitor at some point I did yes sir and who gave you that badge my father Mr Randolph yes sir and over the years uh did you prosecute criminal cases much as what's going on here today uh yes sir at times I did and I believe that I prosecuted in from 1998 to 2001 I believe that uh keep going I'm sorry I mean 2021 I'm sorry until 2021 for 1998 2021 I believe I was involved in five I believe I believe there were five trials five trials is it best that I can remember all with my all with my dad that was really the purpose of me being an assistant solicitor was getting to spend time with him do things with him sure and you five jury trials over all that time but you had a badge that entire time is that correct I had a batch for a big part of that time yes sir you actually had two badges right I had one badge but my my when my granddad became an assistant solicitor for my dad when my dad became the solicitor he had an assistant solicitor's badge right when he passed away I had his badge and that was one of at some point in time you were asking somebody about two badges and that was the other badge I got you um you said you did five criminal jury trials as a prosecutor correct assisted in those or was doing them yes sir I believe I was actually the lead lawyer in one of them I helped my dad and the other four still a part of preparing the case yes sir silver part of gathering the evidence and putting it together for trial um in in a criminal case we didn't do much at a gathering of the evidence we took what law enforcement had gathered but by putting putting it together for the criminal trial correct yes sir presenting evidence in court yes sir giving jury argument I didn't I did the closing argument in one of them yes sir did you ever have any cases that you prosecuted that uh went short of a jury trial either flood out or were dismissed for some reason you know I'm sure that at some point over between 1998 and 2021 that I took some plea but as we sit here today I can't specifically remember that and I don't ever remember working a case up for trial that didn't go to trial but I'm sure at some point in time I was involved in some level on a guilty plea or guilty pleas Ure and you'd agree with me that the Civil system and the criminal system have a lot of differences correct a lot of differences and a lot of similarities and a lot of similarities and that's where I was going next the fundamentally it's about analyzing the evidence preparing for trial presenting that case and making your argument to the jury correct that's that's a big part of it okay and would you agree with me that as cases go on or as you are preparing for trial that you analyze the evidence that's been gathered by law enforcement and present the evidence that uh that supports your case correct that's just part of it presenting evidence that you deem favorable for your position yeah that you analyze the evidence and then you you put in the evidence that supports your case it's an ongoing process would you agree with that that's that's part of what you do and same thing in the civil case right as you go along you may have evidence uh but you ultimately Analyze That evidence and some evidence makes the cut and some of it does not is that fair to say as far as what you're trying to position I I think we agree on that we would agree on that I think so I'm not exactly sure what your question is but I think I understand it I'm just asking you that as a lawyer as you've been since 1994 is that right yeah that's correct it's a simple question you analyze the evidence that's been gathered whether civil or criminal and then present that in court is that correct yes that's part of which is an ongoing process as you prepare for a case is that correct an ongoing process as you prepare for in criminal court for civil court either one well I mean but there's there's a distinction because in civil court you have the deadlines and so you aren't allowed to gather evidence during a trial or a week before trial or um you know for for instance if this was a Civil Trial and we found that OnStar data during the third or fourth week of trial we wouldn't be able to use it because you passed deadlines but in a criminal case you are able to use it but you would agree that none of that was the fault of anyone on this side of the table that GM initially responded they had nothing and then responded all of a sudden that they did I I don't have an opinion and that's certainly not anything I'm intending to convey you talked to this jury a lot about that but you know nothing about that particular part of it is that what you're telling us talk you talked to the jury a lot about the GM data but you're telling me that you're unaware that that GM initially responded to law enforcement's timely request and said they didn't have that but then in the course of the trial all of a sudden came up and said you know what we found something and that's the reason why it arrived late you're saying you don't know anything about that after talking to this jury about that I don't know a single thing about that I know that y'all represented that to the court and I don't have any reason to doubt it but I I don't I don't you would agree that that's generally consistent with the Telemetry data that the FBI did correct the OnStar data did the OnStar I think the OnStar data in the Telemetry data are totally different all right you don't you don't think they're generally consistent with one another is that what you're telling the story no no I'm not telling the jury anything about that I'm just saying you do I think they're consistent I think they're telling I think the OnStar data tells one gives gives you one set of information and the Telemetry data gives you another set of information but you don't think they're consistent um I mean you talked about this jury is it I think we're struggling on what seems to be a fairly simple Point don't you agree Mr Woodard I'm just trying to answer your question and and so I'm not trying to be difficult I just my understanding of what you're referring to is to Telemetry data is when the car goes into park and drive and that sort of thing is that what you're referring to yes and the GPS information is telling you where a vehicle is on a certain path correct in what direction it's going so I think that they're they're just two they're two different types of information the question was were they consistent with one another I don't I I guess so I don't think they contradict each other all right thank you all right um you were the breadwinner for your family correct for your immediate family yes and that included obviously for Maggie correct I'm sorry that included for Maggie correct absolutely and in large measure for Buster and Paul as well would you agree with that did I I was the problem Breadwinner yes no I I was I was their source of I I was the source of income for Maggie Buster and Paul okay I mean I guess as they got older um I mean there's some point where Buster had a job but I mean I would still consider myself to provider for for them at that time again that's not there's no trick here I'm just trying to ask a simple question Mr Waters I don't think you I don't think that was a trick so so you were the primary Breadwinner we can agree on that yes sir go ahead um give me one second all right I'm gonna show you what's for the March is uh space 5-70 and see if you recognize this particular uh item you can go ahead and take it out of the Bachelor of the bag foreign yes sir all right and then I'm gonna show you what was in the bag in five seven can you tell me what that is I can't all right what is that which one 570 what is that all right 571 is what I would consider to be my badge all right and then what is this one right here which is 570. okay 570 would be the one I told you about was my grandfather's badge after he retired when he became an assistant for my dad you're honor this time I'd offer States 571 and 570s yeah I admitted wow where did you keep 570 the one that was your grandfather's single place that it was kept you know where it was recovered by law enforcement no sir would you dispute if it was recovered out of the Mercedes you were driving on September 4th the day the side of the road incident no I believe that yeah they almost push another screen please and 571 where did you where'd you keep this one usually in my car where in your car it could be all of it could be on the dash like you were talking to Mark Ball about it could be in the center console it could be in the cup holder it could be on the seat be on it usually in the front seat but in my car is where I tried to keep it and when you had it in your dash would you have it face up or face down I didn't have any particular manner in which I stored it anywhere there was no Rhyme or Reason to it is what you're telling the jury how you had it in the dash there may be occasions where I had it in the dash for some particular reason but there were a lot of times where it probably was in the dash for no particular reason other than that's where I put it just like I might put it on the seat or in the cup holder you said there were particular reasons why you might put it in the dash what would those reasons be a number of things if I'm going somewhere where I want somebody to see it um then I would put it in the dash if there's another reason for some somebody to see it like for instance if I get pulled over I might have it in the cup holder so an officer could see it when he walked up now why would you do that why would you have it in the cup holder you're not saying you're on official business are you no I'm not saying I'm on official business why would you want it a cup holder if you got pulled over because I found that law enforcement oftentimes is friendlier when you're in law enforcement when you're law enforcement so you considered yourself law enforcement uh no sir I can't say that I considered myself law enforcement we carried a badge on you as a assistant solicitor for two decades roughly from around 98 to yesterday for two decades and ride with it sometimes sitting in the front dash facing out correct that's correct and you would put it in the cup holder so that law enforcement would see you if you got pulled over right that's correct okay so you didn't consider yourself law enforcement I personally didn't consider myself to be law enforcement no sir all right so you were just using happen dispatch to your advantage of taking taking license with it is that correct I guess in some circumstances that is accurate see if you could use it to get away with something correct get better treatment if you got pulled over get better treatment if I got pulled over I mean that's probably a fair statement yeah if somebody in law enforcement saw that yeah I'd say that's true did you uh have to take an oath when you got that badge no sir you didn't not that I remember I I don't I I certainly don't recall taking one like so going somewhere and um raising my hand and saying I promise to do my duty barely and with Integrity you never had to do that um Mr Waters if I did I sure don't recall it I mean it was a very informal process when I became uh volunteer assistant solicitor for my dad and then when I continued with Duffy I mean at some point um you know if if I took any oath at all that I can remember it would be on some paper that um I may have had to sign but I don't specifically remember doing that all right well let's talk about it let's go back to 571. and on the inside of it what are those right there there's the uh an ID card with your picture on it uh yes sir that is all right and at the top on that top leave it in there if you would please can you not see it I can but I'm just gonna see what's on the back all right all right and it's got your picture on it got your name on it uh yes sir that does have my picture in my name don't put that one back for me please all right so you want to look at this top one look at the top one okay okay what what office does it say that you are on that top one right there up there at the top state of South Carolina solicitor the solicitor of the 14th judicial circuit it says that I asked solicitor the 14th judicial circuit I do hereby certify that and it has your name right and it has all that data uh what position does it say that you're appointed to as the okay it says that as solicitor of the 14th judicial circuit I do certify that Richard A murdick was on July 1st 2013 appointed as the deputy solicitor of Allendale Beaufort Colleton Hampton and Jasper counties in and is authorized to enforce the laws in the 14th Judicial Circuit of South Carolina yeah awesome and all of that yes yes sir signed by Duffy Stone signed by Duffy Stone so Deputy solicitor is that correct I was never a deputy solicitor Mr Waters that's what that says but I've never been a deputy solicitor unless Deputy solicitor is I was a volunteer assistant solicitor and as far as I know Sean Thornton has been the only Deputy solicitor that Duffy Stone had and it's a simple point it says Deputy solicitor but Deputy solicitor is a higher rank than assistant solicitor correct to your understanding that's what I think yeah and and that was Sean Thornton I've never been Deputy solicitor even though that does say that all right I agree with and that was signed by Duffy Stone not by me I understand this is what was given to you that's what it was given to you I mean there's this whole long thing at the beginning about whether or not you had an association with law the law enforcement Community but this was given to you not by your father but by a successor correct well no sir I believe we got this because you were talking asking me if I took an oath and I don't remember taking the oath and then you started asking me about these things okay and you agree that this card says Deputy solicitor right I agree that card says Deputy solicitor all right all right do you agree with me that it says on the back that it is reposing special trust and confidence in your ability care prudence and integrity is that what it says on the back of this I mean if you're no sir I mean I I trust if you're reading that off the back of that I assume that it does foreign you were reading off of the one that the uh the one that Duffy Stone gave me correct yeah and then the one at the top where did that one come from you want me to bring it back to you no sir I think I can see it that way that's okay I mean I I I I know what it is I looked at it when you handed it to me so the the card on the bottom is what I got from Duffy Stone the one on the top and and the one on the top should give you a better there we go all right so the one on the top was what came from my dad when he was solicitor the one on the bottom is what came from Duffy Stone when he was solicitor and Duffy Stone took over after my dad retired in 2006. Duffy Stone filled my dad's unexpired the rest of his unexpired four-year term much like my dad filled my granddad so and then Duffy became the solicitor did you ever have lights in your vehicle in the in the particular vehicle no in any vehicle yes sir I did was that a government vehicle I know sir it was not when did you have lights like blue lights and stuff yes sir I had some blue why did you have blue lights and let me remember you did five cases over 20 years and you have blue lights in your vehicle but it was a pro it was your private vehicle correct well it it was the vehicle that I drove it was Law Firm owned vehicle the law firm's own vehicle so how'd you get Blue Lights in there I had them installed and who installed them I believe that uh Eddie Gibson installed them and who was that he's the guy who um apparently does blue light work for most of the sheriff's departments in the 14th circuit and a lot of the police departments and did you when did you have that installment do you recall one vehicle or more than one vehicle I'll start with that I believe I had it in I believe I had blue lights in one vehicle and when did you have that installed do you think I'm not sure it would have been five years ten years no here here I can give you a time frame okay the vehicle that I was in on that that got uh taken in on June the 7th I got that vehicle sometime around decent late December or January so I'd had it for six months I would have had the previous vehicle for five years that's how long we kept vehicles in the law firm so I would have had it for five years and it and and sometime during that five-year period I had lights installed just the sheriff at the time if you could do that I did who was that I believe it was TC Smalls um and I believe in Collington it was Andy Strickland in Carlton it was Andy Strickland and I believe in Allendale it was Tom Carter ah were you friends with Andy Strickland yeah I was friends with Andy Strickland and you you said hey I'm gonna get some blue lights that's all my vehicle he said that's cool our words to that effect I mean that doesn't sound like the words that he would have used or I would have used but I certainly asked him and he certainly said it was okay it was okay all right along with Sheriff Smalls and I believe Sheriff Carter I'm not positive about Sheriff Carter but I believe so I'll show you just real quick what's been marked as States 507. see if you recognize that I believe this is my Suburban um Edison this is my Suburban that um that y'all have okay was that does that look like where your badge was on the day of the incident I have no idea you don't recall putting it there no but I I don't take issue with the fact that it's I don't take issue with the fact that it's there if that's up either if that's what how they say it was I found it messes the picture you're honored off the states five or seven in the evidence you are testified some about the boat case and we'll talk more about that uh I'm sorry The Boat Rack case can we agree that that's what we're talking about when we say the boat case February in 2019. well there's two things you you referring to the Civil Case when you say the bookcase but when I think about the bookcase I think about the charges that y'all brought against pawpaw okay so but they're also the civil case uh pawpaw that's that was your name for Paul yeah I mean I called him Papa Maggie called him Paul Paul bus calls him pawpaw sure roro calls him Papa who was roro that's Rogan Gibson okay and this jury of course has heard multiple recorded statements of you during the course of this did you ever refer to Paula's pawpaw during that I don't know you know do you recall how I refer to I can say Paul if you prefer that no I you can call him whatever you want I'm just asking you if you ever called him that during the course of that entire investigation or is that also the first time today at least publicly is today the first time I've called my son Paul pawpaw no sir that is not correct have you ever called him that on all the recorded statements that this jury has heard I don't know you ever called Rogan roro they're calling reported statements all the time and the recorded statements did you ever call him that I don't know I mean I called him Rogan also so I I don't know but I I'm happy to call him Rogan and I'm happy to call Paul Paul um all right well let's talk about and I'll be I'll be specific with the boat race criminal case and the boat wreck civil case okay is that fair yes sir all right and foreign we've talked a little bit about your badge did you have your badge with you on the night of the boat wreck on the night of the night at a boat wreck did I have it with me yeah when did you go to the hospital that night I did go to hospital that night did you have it with you then I don't know but I don't believe so but I I really don't believe so but when you went to the hospital on the night The Boat Rack were you acting in any official capacity the night of the when I went to the hospital was acting in official capacity yes no sir okay I'll show you what's been marked as States 569 and you recognize the person on the right in that image you know sir you don't recognize that I don't recognize him no I'm asking about that oh me is that you yeah it looks like me all right what's hanging out of your pocket in Plainview looks like a badge you didn't recall that until I just showed you that picture no sir I did not your honored off of stakes pop 69 and evidence okay admit it that's you in the white shirt is that right yes sir it is and this is the badge hanging out your pocket you remember which is that correct looks to be yes sir which badge is that which one of the two do you remember now you can't tell from here okay and why'd you have it hanging out of your pocket like that I don't remember having that I don't know you don't remember that I I don't remember that no sir did you generally walk around with your badge hanging out your pocket generally speaking no sir I did not or only when you wanted some Advantage from it did I did you want some Advantage for wearing it like that did I hang it out in my pocket when I wanted an advantage yes I I may have okay I certainly may have all right what advantage did you want when then I don't even recall this Mr Waters but if I was wanting some Advantage as you say it I guess and I don't remember this but I guess I would want uh you know as I said a badge has a warming effect with other law enforcement and so if I was seeking any advantage as you say then I guess that would be what it was do you ever want to be the solicitor yeah there was a time period where I did did you ever want to be the solicitor yeah there was a time period when I absolutely did when was that uh prior to around the time my prior to my dad um retiring or prior to 2006. yes sir how long did you explore that um I mean I really I wanted to be I want to be a solicitor for a long time but um you know at the time when my dad retired I was already struggling with pills and I knew I couldn't do it in 2006. yes sir we'll talk more about the pills in a bit but you say you're already struggling with pills in 2006 correct that's correct but over that next 15 years you still were able to maintain a lucrative law practice would you agree with that yes sir and you've already testified that all your law partners had no idea of this pill problem that you had all that time correct I'm testifying that I believe in fact I'm certain that none of my partners knew I had an addiction foreign putting your badge out correct no I don't remember I don't even remember having my badge you remember going around talking to the kids the other kids that were on the boat yeah I talked to some of them you remember going to do that yes then was your badge hanging out when you did that as well you know I wouldn't think so Mr Waters but like I said I didn't I don't think so all right so it just comes naturally to put your badge out on something like this that you don't even remember why you did that no I don't even remember having my badge and I specifically know that I didn't use the badge you know did I mean to do this I'm not saying that I didn't but I don't know if I was putting it in my pocket and the flap you know you noticed that that flap is is not velcro down it I I don't know I don't have a specific memory of that and I never went around you know acting like I was on official business so you're saying it might be an accident that your match was hanging out there I'm saying that I have no memory of that whatsoever all right well did you ever you never use these badges as like a wallet right no I did you did I did so you're saying you had your your credit cards and all your stuff in there no sir no sir I'm not saying that and I'm not saying that on that night you just asked me if I ever used it as a wallet and there were times when I used it as a wallet where you're using it as a wallet that night I don't remember but I don't think so I didn't use it as a wallet very often and I didn't use it as a wallet for very long when I did use it as a wallet so let's see if we can get back to what we agree on so you would agree that you had to make a conscious decision to grab that badge and when you went into the hospital correct would you agree with that yeah at some point I had to make a conscious decision pick it up okay but you're saying you don't know if you hung it out like that on purpose while you're talking about law enforcement officer or if it's just an accident that is hanging out of your pocket in full view of everyone well I I am saying that because that is not how I would normally carry uh a badge and even if I wanted to give somebody an impression to me that's got kind of an obnoxious look to it that's just not something that uh I mean that's not something I would typically do but I may have done it that night I have no memory of that okay all right so you're saying that just could be an accident that is hanging out like that I'm saying it could be or I could have put it there like that all right I don't remember did you generally just walk around with it in your pocket or would you only carry it when you wanted to use it for something and I wouldn't generally carry it around in my pocket just any time okay all right all right so we got the badge that may be accidentally hanging out of your pocket you won't concede that you did that purposefully I mean Mr Waters if you want me to say I did that on purpose I don't have a problem with that I'm saying I don't remember that all right so can I tell you that I did that on purpose no sir I can can I say that that this happened by accident no sir I can't what I can say is I don't remember it and that's not how I would normally that's just not how I would normally you know that's that's just not it's not something I did that's not a normal thing so I don't know okay all right that's fine you want to see to this jury that there was any intention or purpose to you doing that at the hospital on the night of the boat ride I'm saying I don't remember using that badge and I specifically remember you know I'm sorry go ahead and you can actually specifically remember what that I like when I when I went into the room with the kids did I pull my badge out and I know that I did not do that no because it was on your pocket like that correct it's on my pocket like that right then did you use that to get into areas that shouldn't be accessed by non-official personnel absolutely not I mean there was nowhere that I went that um that was not truly public domain I mean basically the places that I went to were when I got there I went to pawpaw when I left pawpaw I went to Morgan Dowdy who was like a daughter to Maggie and I had dated Paul for a long time and I went to Morgan um Morgan had an injury to her hand that was that was bad and she was very upset about Mallory um and they were working on her so I left her room I went back to Paw Paw at some point in time I noted I went to Connor's room and I believe those are the only rooms I went to but again I I don't I can't tell you that with certainty while you're wearing that badge like that did you tell any of any of the kids who are in the boat wreck not to cooperate with law enforcement I never told anybody not to cooperate with law enforcement whether I had a badge hanging out my pants didn't have a badge or any point in time did I tell anybody don't cooperate with law enforcement did you become aware in March or April or May of 21 2021 shortly before June that an investigation into the investigation of that night had begun as well as your conduct yeah some I did learn I did learn of that sure I don't know the status of that investigation being that I've been charged with so many things and haven't been charged with that I'm assuming that there may not be charges whether or not you were aware that that had begun in the spring of 2021. yes sir I was aware well at some point in time I became aware of it was that the spirit was it you know February March April I know it was after after um and I know it was after that night and it was before June 7. before June 7th I'm pretty sure that I I already I'm pretty sure that I already knew that did uh mention Andy Strickland you know what happened to him do I know what happened to him when how he lost his job now Sheriff I believe that when he was charged I can't I don't know if he resigned or he was um suspended okay do you remember if that was a few months prior to you becoming aware of an investigation into the investigation of this boat case including you do I know what Danny Strickland was charged and lost his job was that a few months prior to you becoming aware of the investigation into this incident that's on the screen you much prior um I don't really know this for a fact but I believe as I'm sitting here today I believe that Andy was charged back in the fall um and like I said we learned about when uh I've testified about when I understood there was an investigation into whether or not I was acting in a um public manner whatever whatever it was y'all were investigating public corruption or that so if it was a couple of months if it was a month or two when Andy Strickland got charged then if I mean if you showed me that I'd be I'd be surprised because I think it was I think I think he was charged before that all right but you're this was a friend of yours correct the guy who who you asked if you could put lights in your car in a private vehicle correct well I mean Andy yeah I considered Andy a friend I considered TC a friend and I consider Tom Carter a friend all of whom I asked if I could put lights in a vehicle all right and so yes sir I mean I considered Andy a friend would you at least agree with me that in at least the fall of 2020 your friend Annie Strickland and was indicted and lost his job for a financial and Corruption investigation objection response your honor I think there's a link between uh his knowledge of that and what he's admitted that there was an investigation going on uh in the months prior to the murders and the question is something about Andy Strickland being indicted that just don't see the relevance here on India all right we can at least agree that you were aware prior to the murders that there was this investigation correct the one on the screen the one related to the vote the investigation into the boat case was I aware that y'all had started an investigation into what I did in the hospital prior to the June the 7th yes I believe that to be correct all right and if it wasn't before that it was shortly after it UI testified that you've had a pill addiction for approximately 20 years correct I think that's I think that's about right and so when did you start stealing money from clients how long did it take before you started doing that I'm not sure when the first time I did that is you don't know no sir I've gone back and thought about that oh sure I thought about it but to be able to sit here I mean you got to understand I've been in rehab and I've been in jail and I don't have access you know all my telephone calls were put on the media so I I haven't had a lot of phone access I haven't had a lot of access so as we sit here today I cannot tell you the exact time I don't deny that I did it but I can't tell you the exact time that I first did it and you're you told this jury that's the cause of your financial problems foreign did I say that the European addiction was the cause of your financial problems it was certainly a cause not the only cause though correct I know I wouldn't think it was the only cause but yeah certainly a cause you recall testimony in this courtroom about uh how you had some land deals go bad around the time of the recession in 2008-2009 sure and you recall testimony from your law Partners in this courtroom that you have some big cases that they thought cured those issues correct I heard them say that yes sir do you disagree with that do I disagree with what they thought no I mean I don't I don't have any reason disagree if that was true they thought that that my partners thought that um that I I gotten past my financial difficulties I have no reason to dispute that Mr Waters I'm not trying to frustrate you she's what they thought true that I was past my financial difficulties is that the question yes that's the question was it true that I was past my financial difficulties um I mean they were certainly better after that but I mean no I don't I don't no I don't think I was past them no sir all right what was the first big case after the recession that you had Mr wood I can't tell you what the first big case was um what date all right well let's go with uh the Pinckney case do you remember when that was I remember generally speaking when it was yes sir what year was that 2011 would you would you dispute that 2011 when it ended when you got recoveries in that case I mean if you're looking at something that tells me that I have no reason to dispute that but I can't remember off the top of my head but that's certainly in the time frame it's fine Mr Mark we'll go through it let's do it Mr Waters like I said I I take you at that I just don't know off the top of my head all right I don't have a reason to dispute that foreign States three three one let's go with actually three three two three three and three three four do you recognize those documents just generally do you recognize I do all right and just what are those those are disbursement sheets can I have them back please uh yes sir just give me one sec yeah take your time just trying to see which ones I I mean there's some things about it that I'm curious about but yeah we'll talk about questions we'll talk about that all right let's talk about uh let's start with Natasha Thomas do you remember her I do how old was she when she became your client I'm not sure if she was young she was a teenager I'm not sure but I know she was young she was underage correct but yes she was underage I do believe that all right in fact I know that and can you tell me what the uh she was injured in this wreck with uh in an automobile rack correct yes and the company Michelin that was uh one of the defendants for an alleged Tire issue is that correct that is correct all right and do you remember how much Natasha Thomas got in that particular case and I can show it to you on 334. you remember how much she had as a growth settlement I believe it shows two million two million dollars two million dollars all right and how much were your or pmpd's fees that would be attributed to you in that out of that two million dollars eight hundred thousand dollars eight hundred thousand dollars yes sir all right Excuse me yes sir all right and so that would be eight hundred thousand dollars in fees that would get attributed to you that has nothing to do with the money that you subsequently stole from that teenager correct the eight hundred thousand is different from money that I stole yes that's correct all right so you got eight hundred thousand dollars attributed to you with the firm but that was not enough you also stole money from that teenager is that correct that is correct all right when you did that did you sit down with her much as you sat down with this jury and explained to her what was going on while you were stealing her money I that would be the normal process but I certainly don't remember specifically doing it that would be the normal process correct that would be it may be a little different with a teenager but certainly I mean you would sit down with them across the table and go through these documents correct if that that would not be abnormal yes sir all right and then you would try you would explain to them what was going on and how they were getting everything they were entitled to correct if I was the one doing it yes sir and you would look them in the eye why you did that correct it wouldn't be unusual for me to look them in the eye while you were doing some fast talking to a teenager correct I certainly was not telling her the truth I don't know if I was talking fast or slow but I wasn't telling the truth all right well you ultimately convinced her that there was nothing to miss here right while you were stealing her money correct I don't know if I convinced her that nothing was amiss or I misled her but I admit candidly in all of these cases Mr Waters that I took money that was not mine and I shouldn't have done it I hate the fact that I did it I'm embarrassed by I'm embarrassed for my son I'm embarrassed for my family and I don't dispute that I did it I understand that and you understand that we have to ask about these things because we've heard about it in a very academic paperwork manner but every single one of these you had to sit down and look somebody in the eye and convince them that you were on their side when you were not correct that's what you did in every single one of these I mean every time answer my question yes or no and then you can explain I'll let you explain all day long well I mean no sir that may or may not be true and Mr Waters just to try to get through this quicker I admit I know you want to get through it quicker but we're not so answer the question please what what I what I admit is that I misled them I did wrong and that I stole their money now this this is something what's the date on that one I'll bring it back to you well you can tell me I I trust you to tell me accurately all right uh well you know it's kind of funny it doesn't have a date on it but I'll let you take a look at it I I'm just looking at the date of a check so that's December 22nd of 2011. so that was the ballpark so that's 12 years ago for me to sit here and tell you specifically that I remember sitting down and talking with Natasha Thomas I can't tell you that but what I can tell you and I can tell you that I didn't do right by Natasha Thomas I took money from Natasha Thomas that didn't belong to me and I was wrong for doing that okay and I admit that I know Mr Murdoch but you would like for it just to be as simple as that just to say yes ladies and gentlemen I stole money and have that be the end of it but in every single one of these cases you did a comment here on and make this quick correct isn't that what you said isn't that what you implied No Sir Mr Waters you have charged me with murdering my wife and my son and I have sat here for all these weeks listening to all this financial stuff that I did wrong that I'm embarrassed by I'm happy to talk to you about as much of that as you want to talk about I'm required to talk about it as much as you want to talk about it but the fact is is I cannot specifically remember sitting down the details that you're asking me for I I can't tell you but what I can tell you is that in all these Financial situations I stole money that was not my money I misled people that I shouldn't have misled and I did wrong I can tell you that and I may be able to tell you specifically in some instances what I did or didn't do well good well we'll do that but the points that I'm asking you is it's not as just as simple as some paperwork you had to sit down and deal with these people and convince them that you were telling them the truth in order to steal this money correct that may not be true because in some situations I may not have had to do that they may they may have just trusted me to do it okay okay so that's my point is I misled them there's no question about that but did I sit down in each particular instance and like like you're breaking it down step by step I can't say that I can say I did wrong I stole money that wasn't mine and I shouldn't have done it right and it was terrible what I did all right well let's look at States 330. this is uh Arthur Badger and EPS case correct that's great all right you remember what the Total Recovery was in that particular case there were multiple plaintiffs let me ask you that first there were multiple points in that case correct that's correct and do you remember what the Total Recovery was in that case not exactly but I mean I know generally all right was it 12 million dollars would you disagree with that 12 million dollars I mean if you tell me it was 12 million dollars then I believe you but I thought it was a little bit more than that all right and if uh ultimately if you have multiple plaintiffs how do you decide as the plaintiff's order how does it work out that amounts of that Total Recovery get allocated I mean different cases or different ways um is it true that often the defense attorney is the civil defense attorneys will ask the police attorneys how you want that allocated um sometimes yeah sometimes is that what happened in this case in the badger case I can't remember exactly how we came to that who was the uh the deep pocket in the badger case you remember the uh the defendant that had the money that she ultimately recovered from the vast majority do you remember well it was ups and I I believe it was I can't remember if it was corporate or if there was insurance but it was certainly UPS was the major defendant but I believe Arthur Badger was a Defender I can't remember I know I know UPS was did you sit down with him and explain this paperwork that you were using to steal his money I believe I did sit down with Arthur Badger and managed to convince him that nothing was a mess while at the same time stealing money I believe I did and did you allocate millions of dollars to Arthur Badger personally while only telling him that his recovery was going to be around three hundred thousand dollars I believe that I did yes yes and on this exhibit 3 30 sat down and looked him in the eye with all this stuff on here and fast talked him past these figures that he believed you and left thinking that you had done him right I would have did I believe that I sat down with Arthur Badger and I know that I missed LED Arthur Badger and I'm sure at some point during that conversation that I looked him in the eye foreign stage 333 you remember hacking hacking me do you remember him I do what happened to him um he was injured in the same wreck that Natasha Thomas was injured in was he badly injured he was how badly injured wasn't yes I mean he was terribly injured he became a I can't remember what level but he was a quadriplegic do you remember what the Total Recovery Mount was for him not off the top of my head no sir all right well let me show you space 333 and see what the title if you recall what the Total Recovery was in that case it looks like it was 10 million two hundred and forty five thousand dollars and that was for a Hakeem right that's correct and how much of that was the attorney's fees that would have gone to pmpz that would have been attributable to you uh four million ninety eight thousand dollars four million dollars in legal fees that you would have gotten from the settlement is that correct four million to ninety eight thousand dollars yes sir and in the end that wasn't enough for you correct was that enough for you was that enough for me in that case yeah I mean it was four million over four million dollars in legal fees that you received that would have been attributable with you through the law firm at the end of the year whatever it worked out to be but you would have been credited with over four million in fees for that is that correct that's correct and was that enough for you was that enough for me or did you take more I I took monies from Hakeem Pinkney that I that did not belong to me that I should not have taken been rendered to paraplegic no sir he was a quadruplete thank you for correcting yes sir you ultimately take money from his mother Pamela as well I believe that I did you remember how much money you took from from a king no sir none off the top of my head I do not if I told you it was over 370 000 would you agree with that if if that's what the records show I don't dispute that do you remember how much you took from the teenager Natasha Thomas in addition to your legal fees not off the top of my head no sir I told you it was over 350 000 would you agree with that I don't dispute it do you remember how much you took from Arthur badger not off the top of my head no sir it was over 1.3 million dollars would you agree with that I don't dispute it around the time that this was going on did you have some land deals that were going bad that had gone bad which 2008 2009 2010 2011. I think that they I think this had happened a little bit before that but I had some land deals that that you know had certainly had problems and that had something to do with the money you were taking as well did it not I think the whole picture had things to do with me doing stuff I shouldn't have done I mean I I would agree that I mean that that certainly would have played some role in it where you live and I wealthy lifestyle a wealthy lifestyle probably I mean we were living whatever lifestyle probably would you characterize your lifestyle as wealthy you know that's not that's not how I would characterize it but is it as wealthy I'm not going to take issue with it around this time were you making more than a million dollars a year around what time 2011. yes 2012. yes and you were still stealing money as well correct yes can we at least agree that that's a lot of money that's fine okay I think there's no question that's a lot of money okay good we can agree on that that's a lot of money correct I feel like we're struggling here isn't were you living a wealthy lifestyle were you living a wealthy lifestyle I just don't know what you mean by wealthy yeah that's a hard question Mr Murdoch well it's it's hard for me to know exactly what you want you know um and it depends I was spending money that I sh that wasn't mine that I shouldn't have I think that you know we lived a a lifestyle I don't I don't have an issue if you want to call it wealthy all right would you concede with me that not all of this money was going to pills at this point in time all the stolen money no I doubt that it was okay and it was being used to support your wealthy lifestyle well I haven't looked at all these documents to know exactly what was being spent where but here's what I do know I know that I was making a bunch of money and I should have had I should have had uh more money than I did and I know that I was spending a bunch of money on pills and I know that you know I just I don't remember in 2011 if those land I just can't remember those land deals but you know if if I spent money on other things I don't dispute that either I just haven't looked at the records okay but you would at least concede that the money you were stealing was going to support your ever expanding wealthy lifestyle would you concede that did all of the money I stole any of it Mr Murdock any other yeah I would certainly agree that there was money that that didn't go to buy just pills all right and you would concede that even though you were generating millions of dollars in fees that was not enough for you would you concede that if if by concede that you mean was I also stealing money that I shouldn't have yes sir I agree with that I've said that repeatedly who are the plowers they were two young girls from Colombia they were underage when they became your clients yes sir that they suffer a loss in their family as a result of an accident they did who what loss did they suffer who died their mother their mother did you get a sizable recovery in the case and that that particular case related to that yes sir do you remember how much that recovery was I don't got any idea I know it was a significant settlement I know it was a very good settlement but millions of dollars oh yeah it was millions of dollars but whether it was you know two million I I know it was significant I I don't know if it was eight figures but I know it was a significant settlement and was there a conservatorship for them because they were underage there was a conservatorship um for them but I don't think the fact that they were underage is why there was a conservatorship you don't think it was because at least in part they were underage when the settlement was received no that's not what I that's not what I remember but for purposes of of your thank Mr waters I agree that was a conservative appointed well what is your memory why that the conservator was appointed my memory is is that the father in this case who was the beneficiary or a big beneficiary in this and who was the pr of the mother's case was an undesirable witness and there was testimony that he had it was testimony that he had hit his wife um and it was clear we felt like we didn't we didn't want him to be the face of the lawsuit so we appointed a conservator it was that for that purpose is why I believe we appointed a conservator okay and who was that that was Russell Lafitte at Palmetto State Bank yes sir and after that did you get Russell Lafitte to start loaning you money from the Paula girls account that he was conservative for he loaned me money from the plowler account I don't know if I got him to do that oh you didn't talk to him about it y'all didn't talk about that at all no uh we did talk about it I mean I mean there's emails to that effect are you disputing that to this jury Mr Waters I'm not disputing I'm just telling you that Russell Lafitte gave me a loan from the pilers your question was did I get him to do that and I don't necessarily believe that to be accurate who came up with the idea I don't know that it was come up with an idea that was um I think that Russell felt like that it was uh a Sound Investment for those girls to charge me a higher interest rate when they weren't getting but so much interest somewhere else so what was that interest rate that y'all thought was such a good idea for these girls do you recall what it was I can't remember the reality is is that you needed the money and this was a convenient source to keep your massive cash flow going as early as 2011 2012. isn't that correct well this was a loan yes sir but exactly why it came from them versus the bank I can't I don't I can't tell you the details without looking at all that I can't tell you that off top of my head and despite all you were earning you would even send Russell emails saying hey transfer over 75 000 from the plowler account into my account correct you remember emails without a fact that you would have to him do I remember an email to that effect no I don't remember that but if you did their emails to that not if you say there were Mr Waters I don't dispute that I don't dispute any of this that I took money that didn't belong to me that I misled people I know that you want the answer to be that simple last night we agree on that we don't agree on that well no sir I I don't necessarily want the answer to be simple I just want everybody to understand I do not dispute that I stole money that was not my money that I misled people to do that that I misled people that trusted me to do that and that what I did was terrible so I don't dispute that it's just the way you're asking these questions and you know I mean there's some things in there that I do take issue with okay which part of what I just asked you about the pliers did you take issue with you take issues that y'all didn't Inspire to do that you and Russell yeah an issue with that take issue with that okay I can tell you that Russell Russell Lafitte never conspired with me to do anything whatever it was done was done by me okay so you told the flower girls that you were borrowing money from their account that no I don't know I don't I don't know that I that I I told him to tell them I I don't I don't recall I I don't believe so but I don't I can't sit here and tell you what I told him however many years ago did you tell Russell he could borrow money from that account too I I don't remember having any discussion with him about him borrowing money it was the supposed interest rate you were paying far lower than anything you could have gotten anywhere else I don't even know what interest rate I was paying okay one thing's clear you never told this to the plower girls did you I would have thought the interest rate that I was paying was a little bit more than what a bank loan would have been but I don't know that I don't know that to be I don't know what the interest rate was so I don't know that for sure when you stole the badger money how much did you steal from Arthur Badger that we talked about before in the upsk I don't remember the exact amount over 1.3 million dollars would you dispute that I don't dispute but don't dispute that and that was in addition to the 1.2 million dollars an attorney's Feast for his case alone that would have been attributed to you through the firm what I stole from Arthur Badger let me ask you this inappropriately was in addition to any fees did I legitimately earn I shouldn't have stole the money from Arthur badger I misled him and I was wrong did you speak with Russell Lafitte once you stole this money from Arthur badger about structuring that 1.3 million dollars that you stole in a manner so it appeared to be payments to the Plyler account do you understand the question no sir say that again did you have any conversations with Russell Lafitte about structuring this 1.3 million dollars into multiple payments and then applying it to the plowler account I I've heard the testimony and I've seen some of those records you did did you have any conversations with Russell about that I had to okay I had to have all right you even asked him to recut the check correct to have Jeannie recut the check I've seen I've seen uh I believe an email or a text to that effect so you don't dispute that no I don't dispute that what I dispute is if if you're insinuating in any way this was stuff that I did okay I mean this stuff I I did these things wrong Russell Lafitte didn't do anything I'm not here to talk about that I'm just talking about what went on and I know but you keep talking about what I did with Russell Lafitte and what I want to let you know is that I did this and I'm the one that took people's money that I shouldn't have taken and that Russell Lafitte was not involved in helping me do that if he did it he did it without knowing it all right so you sent him an email and then asked him to recut the check and have the check made out to various amounts short of that and then applied those over time to give the illusion of payments to the plowler account is that correct Mr Waters is that correct I don't know but I'll tell you this I don't dispute I don't dispute what's in those emails as far as or text as far as what I told Russell and as far as what I did uh to again take money that didn't belong to me that wasn't mine and that I was wrong for taken it's just the specifics of that you want me to give you details on and I can't do that I do not dispute what's in those texts or emails and did you steal that Badger money because you had to pay back the Plyler girl's money before they turned 18 and reach the age of majority and Russell would then have to be held to account for that money that he had learned to himself and to you first off I don't know anything about any money that Russell loaned to himself I only know about what he loaned to me and I don't specifically I don't believe that me stealing Arthur Badgers money and taking that money that did not belong to me that I wrongly took had anything to do I don't remember it having a relationship with having to pay back a loan or that being some time pressure to pay back a loan that he gave me on the plywood conservative ship no and I'm not saying that that didn't happen I'm saying that I don't remember that's not the way I remember it and I don't remember it did you ultimately borrow a million dollars roughly from the clawler girls without their knowledge doesn't sound right about a million dollars in total um if if you tell me that's the number I mean that surprises me but I don't dispute what's in the records but I didn't believe I had a loan for are you saying a million dollars I didn't believe that I had a loan Mr Waters if that's what the records say I don't dispute it but that's not what I thought I didn't think I had a million dollar loan from them but if that's what the records say I don't dispute that but I can tell you this if I had a million dollar loan from them um I I don't remember that and I may have I may be confusing it with what a loan from the bank um but again if that's what's in the records I don't dispute it all right so you have no memory whatsoever and so for all you know it's just a coincidence that the plowers were about to turn 18 when you stole this Badger money and you applied a significant amount of it to pay that off before they turned 18. you don't have any memory of that no I can tell you that that was never that that was never an issue or motivation for me again taken Arthur badges money that I shouldn't have taken that didn't belong to me and that I was wrong for um I I don't remember alone from the plow or conservatorship as being motivation for that so for all you can remember it's just a coincidence why stole Arthur badges money just being a coach why you applied it to the Plyler loans right before they turned 18. no I I I'm not saying is coincidence or not a coincidence what I'm saying is I don't remember that and so I don't remember that being a motivation if it was I just I I didn't know I had a million dollar loan from the Plyler conservatorship um at least as I sit here today but you know I would have known I had a loan from somewhere and if I took Arthur Badger's money and applied it to that I mean again I stole money that didn't belong to me I misled Arthur badger to take that money and I was wrong how many times have you practiced that answer before your testimony today because I'm having the same one over and over again I've never practiced that answer but you keep asking me these questions and I keep using that answer let me show you what's been entered in evidence as to as States 321. you recognize generally that document I do and what is that this is the dispersion that she owned the Dion Martin case what happened to Dion Martin he got in a wreck did you know his family when he got into wreck prior to him getting in the room um I knew who his family was but prior to getting into wreck but after he got in this wreck I became very close with his family came very close to his family and Dion suffered some pretty severe injuries correct a Dion was hurt bad yeah using putting an injury to his head um you know I heard you say that the other day I don't specifically remember Dion having a um head injury I believe Dion had more Orthopedic injuries but he may have had some injury to his head you met with him on a number of occasions I yes I met with him on a number of occasions met with his parents on a number of occasions about Dion not the case while the case was going on I don't know if I met with his parents about Dion's case but I know I met with Dion and I may have met with his parents if if they say that I mean his dad's one of the most honorable fellas that I know if he says I met with him I certainly believe that but you said you became close with them correct because of the parents um I consider Dion's yes I consider I think the world of his dad and his mom and Dion ah what was the recovery that was obtained in Dion's case see it looks like recovery two two million dollars actually this is um let's see I know it was two million dollars but I believe the recovery was less than two million dollars like this I believe the recovery was less than two million dollars I believe that I said it was two million dollars I can't remember exactly what recovery is but I know it was less than two million dollars and I know that I misstated it as two million dollars so you falsified the paperwork correct it it appears that I put inaccurate information on the paperwork yes sir you put inaccurate information you falsified it right did you like that word yes sir all right and that's that right there where you put that 500 000 on there correct oh I'm sorry can I have the elements I'm sorry Mr what is what was the question all right let's get the Elmo up and I'll show you right there that's the 500 000 that you falsified this document with is that correct it says structured annuity directly to Michael Gunn uh that looks like one place that I yes why did I yeah what was your purpose in doing that it appears that I was stealing his money five hundred thousand dollars if you're not inflating your fees with that one I mean you you don't remember I I noted I inflated the fees like I just talked about but I believe what go back to that top of that thing I believe what I must have done with the structured annuity is I had that 500 000 check and I must have had that made to uh I must have had that made to forge as you've heard to steal that money from Dion Martin all right down at the bottom yeah is that your signature down there it is is that Dionne Martin's signature on the other side you dispute that nah I don't dispute that so you would have sat down with Dion Martin this document with him and convinced him that there was nothing to miss here you know again I don't know if I went over to document with him or not but I certainly misled Dion Martin I certainly lied to Dion Martin I certainly took money from Dion Martin that did not belong to me and I shouldn't have done it you don't specifically remember talking to Dion there was nothing in you that causes you to remember talking with Dion sitting there with this document in front of him as you looked him in the eye knowing that you were lying to him the whole time you don't even remember that nothing in you that causes you to remember that to specifically remember I'm not sure that I did sit down with Dion Martin um but I certainly Mr Waters I'm misled Dion Martin I lied to Dion Martin I took Dion Martin's money when I shouldn't have well let me ask you this if all the people on here all these exhibits do you have any independent recollection of the time where you sat down and looked that person in the eye and you were lying to them and convincing them that everything was okay while you stole their money do you remember it even one of them I'm sure I did okay well tell us about one I mean you have to show me you have to give me I'm asking you if you remember one time where you're sitting there in your heart looking somebody in the eye knowing you're stealing from them and you remember it I remember stealing from people I remember lying to people and I remember misleading people for me to tell you that I sat down with each one of these people um I'm asking you to tell me about just one conversation one time where you recall looking somebody the eye and convincing them with your lies that nothing was amiss one conversation there were plenty of conversations where I looked people in the eye and I lied to them there were plenty of times where I took money that I shouldn't have taken there were plenty of times where I stole money for me to sit and tell you a specific time that I sat down with a specific document and what exactly was said if you ask me questions but I I can't I can't remember sitting down with Dion they certainly remember it don't they Mr Murdock I don't know if they do or not but I would assume so but you can't tell us one time where it just sticks out of your memory where you're like pulling a fast one right now oh no or anything whatever reaction you had oh no remember a single one no sir that's not correct I can remember a lot of times where I lied to my clients I misled my clients and I stole money from my clients in conversations but for me to sit and tell you that I had a conversation about this particular document I don't dispute it I know you don't dispute it Mr Martin you've said that 100 times haven't you but you can't recall for this jury one of these people looking them in the eye while you lie to them you can't recall a single one I've asked you this three times now oh I promise you the honor Aspen answered three times here you go Miss Mr Waters isn't it Mr Murdock I I I don't know if your points made or not but here here's here's you don't know that either here's what I will say again I remember lying to clients of mine I did it on more than one occasion I took their money when I shouldn't have taken it I'm sure that I looked them in the eye I'm sure that I misled them but I can't tell you exactly when those occurred 12 years ago is the only point I don't dispute that day occurred I don't dispute to everything about what I did was wrong okay but I can't sit and tell you the specific details that you're wanting me to give you we could just write that answer down on a sheet of paper and you could hold it up each time you want to say that couldn't you if injections if that's what you want to do Mr Waters but I'm trying to answer your question all right these were real people you were dealing with right absolutely they were you know I know you want to give that answer but these were real people aren't they no they're very real people and you know one of the saddest parts of this whole thing is is you know they're people that I I still care about and I did them this way you know that's what I was meaning in that text that you made an issue about to Annette Griswold and it was a lot talking about my partners but it was a lot talking about these people I mean I know the people that I did wrong and that I heard that I stole from I mean they're people that I think a lot of and they didn't know hang on hang on I want to say one more thing and there's no question that the actions that I did the things that I did wrong hurt a lot of the people that I care about the most and I did a lot of damage and I wreaked a lot of havoc see if you recognize this I do which case is this this is Elise Mallory and what happened in this case I stole her money what happened though with the underlying case can you tell the jury that do you remember that um I believe it was Miss Taylor uh Miss Mallory's I believe it was her daughter might have been a granddaughter but I believe it was her daughter was uh in a wreck did she die and she got killed and Miss Mallory came to you for help she did you remember that one at all okay we remember one now oh no Mr Waters I remember all of these people okay it's not that I don't remember them you're just asking me details about conversations I can promise you I remember all of these people that I did wrong all right and you stole all of the money did most most of the money that I've been accused of stealing I stole no I mean you stole every single dime of the recovery she didn't get one dime isn't that right I have to look at the records but if that's credited yourself with legal fees and then you stole all the rest of the money correct I I don't dispute that all right first of all tell me about Miss Malley so she lost her daughter correct is that correct that is correct and she came to you for help doctor correct granddaughter but all right one all right and she came to you for help correct yes sir I agree with you on that very very sweet lady correct very sweet lady all right tell me about your conversation when you looked her in the eye and lied to her while you were stealing every dime of the money that's just a perfect example Mr Waters I stole her money I did her wrong but I don't even believe that at least Mallory was there when I stole that money I don't if you look at that disbursement sheet there's I I don't even believe I ever showed that to her but you don't remember having any conversations with her when you lied with her about this case while you were stealing all her money I don't think I did in this case I don't think I had any meetings with her I think I stole her money and I don't believe that I had a meeting with her see again you can't tell us one conversation you have with any of these people when you look them in the eye and convince them that you are doing them right that you were telling the truth that's not true Mr Waters I remember a lot of those conversations I remember a lot of them okay all right you just testified you remember a lot of them I've been asking you now for the past 10 minutes to tell me about one of them where it's stuck in your heart there are a lot of stuck in your brain there are a lot of conversations I had where I misled my clients and I stole their money where they trusted me and I remember them okay so again can you tell me one tell me how it went down what you said how you convinced them how you looked them in the eye how you made them believe how you use your skills as a trial lawyer to convince them can you just tell me about one of those what was going through your head when you did it your honor objection on rule 40 free we've been going over and over and over this in Jackson's over all right what's your question Mr Waters can you tell me about one of the conversations you had with all of these people just one I can tell you what was going through your head and how it went down when you sat there and looked them in the eye and convinced them that you were doing them right while you were lying to them and stealing their money yes sir I had a lot of conversations with a lot of my clients that I cared about and so I will tell you that I had conversations with them where I misled them and I lied to them and I took their money and um that was a a number of times but you're asking me just one specific one Mr Murdock every single every single one of these clients I would have had conversations with at some point but this particular like Mr Waters that disbursement sheet I didn't have there was never a sit down with Miss Mallory about the dispersing the money you don't recall talking to her about the status of her case and telling her lies and convincing her that you were on her side you don't remember that no I definitely remember that but that's not what you asked me I had numerous conversations with Miss Mallory you know about this case but the fact is is you were asking me about me sitting down with this disbursement sheet looking her in the eye and convincing her and and I'm telling you that that didn't happen in this case now I had a lot of conversations with her where I misled her Mr Waters where I lied to her um tell me about one about tell me how it went down where and then a recess for the day and we Zoom at 9 30 tomorrow morning everyone remains student while the jury leaves foreign two experts we brought in basically one of them last night and another one came in today from out of state they're not complicated ones with Pathologists testimony perhaps take 30 to 45 minutes on the rep I don't believe there's gonna be much cross the other one is a crime scene analyst Texas specifically based on the pathologist testimony about what happened to the feed room total they should not take more than two and a half hours I wonder this apparently been gone for a while if we might put them up tomorrow um either first thing in the morning or the morning break I believe his cross is probably going to go into Monday anyway at the rate we're going um it's just an accommodation they're not controversial they're not going to opine on who killed who when and how just the mechanics of what happened your honor and I think the defense would have to concede it I've been very it's common accommodating as I can throughout this but I do not want to interrupt my cross they they took a very long time today and the state's entitled to the stay in consideration without interruption can you project how many more hours you have well I'm actually didn't think it would take this long to get this far but I think I've got some more financial move through and then we'll get to the other evidence so four hours six hours I'm so bad at that you're on a three four something like that yeah and if that's out at the outside perhaps tomorrow afternoon we could get to one again we can probably do this fairly quickly if you're honored um just leave that door open I'm going to keep them here but if I have to keep them here over the weekend the financial impact of that is huge understand that the Dilemma but I'm not going to require the state to um break up the cross-examination of this witness well again you know as I sit here look at this I could have sworn this was a murder case for two hours now we haven't heard the word murder once and not criticizing the strategy obviously denigrating his character is what this is about but really not relevant to the issue of whether he killed probability is an issue and as it relates to all Witnesses in every case the world adjourned until 9 30 tomorrow morning all right foreign
87If-Q2pJWQ,Philippines Street Food - AMAZING Filipino Food at Aling Sosing's Carinderia in Manila!,"One of the best Filipino food meals you can eat in Manila!
►Subscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Aling Sosing's is often considered to be one of the best carinderias, or local Filipino food restaurants, in all of Manila. The crowd that shows up to eat lunch here everyday reinforces the fact that they are no doubt one of the spots you want to be in Manila, if you’re a food lovers. When I was eating in Manila, eating at Aling Sosing's was certainly among the best local Filipino food restaurants that I tried.

Aling Sosing's is a very typical type of local street food restaurant, sitting on the corner of a street, near to Makati. Just like most carinderias, all the food is prepared ahead of time, and sits at the front of the restaurant. When you arrive to order, you just simply pick and choose the different dishes that you want to order, find a table, and they will bring you the dishes to your table. Additionally, some of the famous dishes to eat at Aling Sosing's are off the grill, and you’ll smell the wonderful aroma of the grilling meats the entire time you’re eating, and it’s fantastic.

Ying and I arrived about 11 am on a weekday, and luckily we beat the main lunch traffic, but just barely. There were tables available when we arrived, but as soon as we sat down and order it filled up. Sof if you eat at Aling Sosing's Carinderia you might want to arrive before the main lunch rush. Additionally, some of the Filipino food dishes sell out fast, and they don’t cook them again for the day - once they are sold out, they are done for the day.

Here are the main Filipino dishes I ordered:
Pinakbet - A stew of mixed vegetables, oftentimes flavored with shrimp paste. This was the best versions of pinakbet I’ve ever had.
Inihaw na tilapia - The grilled tilapia is quite well known at this restaurant. It was simple and delicious.
Inihaw na liempo - The grilled pork belly is one of their signature dishes, and it’s every bit as good and smoky as it looks.
Kaldereta - A Filipino food I love so much is kaldereta, a goat stew, mainly because I love goat so much. It was oily, but really good.
Adobong pusit - I saw the squid the pot and decided to try it out. It was a little on the sweet side.
Pork BBQ - Fresh off the grill, Ying and I ordered some of their pork bbq. The pork was tender and lathered in bbq, it was amazing.

Total price - 640 PHP ($12.90)

If you’re looking for a local Filipino restaurant in Manila that I think serves some of the best Filipino food, Aling Sosing's is a restaurant you’re going to want to check out. The food is awesome, the setting and positive atmosphere is refreshing, and the constant smoke from the grill will keep your nose happy and wanting more!

Subscribe to my channel for more delicious food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe",1,"- Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens. I'm in Manila, Philippines, and for lunch today I am eating at a Filipino roadside restaurant. This is one of the restaurants that I am most looking
forward to eating at. This place is on the corner of the road. There's a mechanic's
shop kind of surrounding. It's a great environment, and the Filipino food they serve here looks absolutely incredible. (lively music) Hello, hello. What is your name? - Martina. - [Mark] Martina. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - [Mark] How old are you? Four. (sizzling) (chopping) Can I have leimpo, two. There were so many restaurants
I was looking forward to eating at in Manila but the legendary Aling
Sosing's Carinderia, located on the corner of
a neighborhood street, shaded by a giant mango tree with an impressive array of Filipino food was a local spot I couldn't wait to try. Like most carinderias, or
local Filipino food restaurants in the Philippines, to order, all you have to do is walk
up to the front of the stall, check out all the glorious
dishes in front of you, and pick and choose whatever you like. - One tilapia? - And one tilapia, yes please. Oh, thank you. Oh, squid, can I have squid also. And also this, and also
one plate of this one. Pok med, yes. Okay, and two rice. The most challenging part is not ordering everything you see. Oh yeah, Mike is looking at all that food. Michael, look at all that food. I had read that this was place would get just absolutely
jam packed at lunch time, so luckily Jing and I
came right at 11 a.m. We arrived here there were tables open but right now as we sat down it's completely full, there no more tables left. People are gonna start waiting and it's not even lunchtime
yet, it's just 11 a.m. It is a carinderia-style restaurant. It's a local Filipino food restaurant, and you walk up to the front, they have all of the dishes prepared, all of the different stews, and all of the different
common, typical Filipino dishes, and then they also are known
for their grilled tilapia, and they're also known for
their inihaw na liempo, which is the grilled pork belly. So, this is one of those restaurants where you could just stand up there and pick and choose so many dishes, and it's hard to know when to stop because you wanna eat it all. This is also a great time
to come to this restaurant because you see all the
dishes are prepared. And another thing I read
about this restaurant is that they don't recook any more food, or they don't cook any more dishes, so once that dish is
gone, you're out of luck, they won't have it again
for the rest of the day. I gotta start with the signature dish which is their grilled pork. They have it all in
just slabs of pork belly that they grill like that
but then when you order it they chop it up into bite-sized pieces. Big bite-sized pieces, and you can see the, oh,
that's the skin right there, that chewy skin. Well, I think I'm just gonna
go in with my fingers for this. I want to get a piece for my first bite that includes all layers of the belly. Oh yeah, you can see the skin, the fat, and immediately I can feel the
juices coming onto my fingers when I pick that up. It's so smokey, and then the meat is tender but then the skin is pretty rubbery but that's all part of
the textural experience. Next up I'm gonna try the fish but I think I'm gonna make my sauce first with calamansi and chilis. I think this might be soy sauce. I'm going to go for the soy sauce and then I'm going to add
this to my chili bowl. And then squeeze in the calamansi. Oh yeah. This is the sauce of champions, and then just kind of mash
up this chili a little bit. I'm definitely gonna ask
them for some more chilis. Actually at the front there they had a whole panful of chilis, so I think you can maybe go up there and self-serve yourself. Alright, that's gonna
be perfect for the fish. Okay, grilled tilapia here. Oh, that feels nice and soft. Oh, you can see how juicy it is too there. Oh, wonderful and I gotta go in for some of that chili and that soy sauce and goodness. Oh, look at that bite. Oh, no I lost the chili. The chili fell over. Okay, I'll scoop that back into my spoon. Oh, that tilapia is so nice and juicy and it has a nice smokey flavor, and then just that simple
sauce, the soy sauce with the citrus-y calamansi, and the calamansi has a flavor that's, I think it's somewhere
halfway in-between an orange and a lemon. Maybe it has like little
bit of a sweet tinge to it compared to a lime or a lemon but it still has that nice
sour, citrus-y flavor. It's just a simple sauce combination that you can basically
eat with everything. This is a Filipino dish that I think it's eggplant, there's okra, there are long beans, and
there's bitter melon as well, and if I remember correctly this dish there's some shrimp paste or some krill paste that
gives it its flavor. So, I will dig into some, oh, and I think we might
have some fried pork in here that gives it its flavor too. Put this onto my rice. Oh, that's awesome. It has a really nice garlic-y taste to it. That's really garlic-y and then you have, I did get a piece of
like crispy pork belly I think in that bite. And that pumpkin is amazing. It's not like mushy at all. It's kind of like, or maybe it's a squash because it has a very silky texture to it, rather than being that like kind of mushy, dry texture. That's delicious. I gotta take one more bite of that. Extraordinary actually, extraordinary. And I'm gonna follow that
with some of this soup. Oh, wow. I was actually expecting
it to be plainer than that. Oh, that's really good. A little bit sour, and it has a very meaty broth taste to it, and yet it's not too salty, and the next dish I ordered is kaldereta, and this is another
well-known Filipino dish but this is like a stew. Put this onto my rice. Let me get a little
bit more of that sauce. Oh, I love that sour taste to it. Kind of rich, kind of oily
stew with a sour taste, and then that meat is so tender. That'll be really good with a chili on it. As soon as you bite into that chili that's just an eruption of chili. Oh, that makes, oh yeah, I'm a little bit of a chili addict but that tastes really, really good. And next I've got a squid dish. Oh, a leaf has fallen into the squid. Yeah, and I think it's
black ink with the squid. Let me just taste one of
the little heads actually. Put this onto my rice, and oh, I'm gonna add a little
bit more of that squid sauce. Oh, look at that darkness. That's very sweet and a little sour and salty. It almost tastes like
sweet and sour squid. And then the squid is very tender but it almost has like, you can sense that it has like a
little bit of rubberiness underneath the tenderness. So, how they've cooked it,
it's very nice and tender. - How's the food? - Awesome, man, very, very good. We just ordered some of
these grilled pork skewers, pork barbecue. Oh, look at that. That looks wonderful. Okay, let me reach into
this pork barbecue. They've just really packed on the meat onto this skewer and then
there's a piece of fat at the end here. Oh, that's right off the grill. Oh, that is just ridiculously tender without being too tender. Oh, and that almost has like a little bit of a sweet barbecue sauce to it. We didn't order this at first bu then Ying said we should order this, so I'm glad we got it. The texture of that meat. Thank you, thank you very
much, the food is so good. Hello. How are you? Hello. Nice to meet you. What's your name? - Jason. - Jason. - Kaldereta. - Kaldereta. - Margherita. - Margherita. Nice to meet you, man. Nice to meet you, man. (lively music) Thank you, okay. Oh yeah. Now we're talking. Okay. Now we can do some serious chili eating. Oh yes. - Wanna soup? - Oh yes, please, thank you. Oh, hot fresh soup. Is it beef? Okay, thank you. Okay, I gotta take a. Oh. Oh, that's so hot. Oh yeah, it is so rich. Put some of this over the fish. Oh yeah. And a chili. Oh yeah. That completes the trio of flavors. Oh, and that's wonderful. (talks in foreign language) - $640. - Thank you very much. Sarap. Lots of people are coming here for the amazing food and so we just finished our meal and then we got up off the table 'cause people were waiting for our table, so now I'm just standing around just enjoying the aromas from the food and from the grill and just this awesome, awesome
atmosphere here in Manila. And yeah, if you're looking
for some properly good local Filipino food in Manila, this is a carinderia, a local Filipino food restaurant that you don't want to miss. The grilled dishes are good, all the different dishes that you can pick and
choose from at the front are good, the owners are really friendly. This is another restaurant

LTdnFdJxWEg,See what happened when Alex Murdaugh took the stand,"Alex Murdaugh took the stand to testify in his double murder trial Thursday morning, admitting he lied to investigators when he said he was not at the scene of the killings of his wife and son minutes before the state says the fatal shootings in June 2021. CNN's Randi Kaye has the latest followed by commentary from legal experts. #CNN #News",1,"WHERE THESE DRAMATIC REVELATIONS UNFOLDED. >> DID YOU TAKE THIS GUN OR ANY  GUN LIKE IT AND BLOW YOUR SON'S  BRAINS OUT ON JUNE 7th OR ANY  DAY OR ANY TIME? >> NO, I DID NOT. >> DID YOU SHOOT A 300 BLACKOUT  INTO HER HEAD CAUSING HER DEATH? >> MR. GRIFFIN, I DIDN'T SHOOT  MY WIFE OR MY SON ANY TIME EVER. >> Reporter: ALEX MURDAUGH  PROCLAIMING HIS INNOCENCE AND  AFTER MORE THAN 20 MONTHS  ADMITTING HE LIED ABOUT ONE KEY  PIECE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. >> MR. MURDAUGH, IS THAT YOU ON  THE KENNEL VIDEO AT 8:44 P.M. ON JUNE 7th, THE NIGHT MAGGIE AND  PAUL WERE MURDERED? >> IT IS. >> Reporter: OVER AND OVER  MURDAUGH HAD TOLD INVESTIGATORS  HE HADN'T SEEN HIS FAMILY SINCE  DINNER AND WAS NOT AT THE DOG  KENNELS AROUND THE TIME OF THE  MURDERS. BUT THAT VIDEO EXTRACTED FROM  HIS SON'S PHONE WAS RECORDED  MINUTES BEFORE PROSECUTORS  BELIEVE THE KILLINGS OCCURRED  AND MANY WITNESSES HAVE  TESTIFIED IT WAS ALEX MURDAUGH'S VOICE ON THE RECORDING. MURDAUGH TOLD THE JURY HE HAD  LEFT THE KENNELS AND DRIVEN HIS  GOLF CART TO THE MAIN HOUSE ON  THE PROPERTY. >> THERE'S NO WAY THAT I HAD  HIGH VELOCITY BLOOD SPATTER ON  ME. >> JUST TO BE CLEAR, WERE YOU  ANYWHERE IN THE VICINITY WHEN  PAUL AND MAGGIE WERE SHOT? >> I WAS NOWHERE NEAR PAUL AND  MAGGIE WHEN THEY GOT SHOT.  >> Reporter: REGARDING THE  STATE'S GPS DATA THAT SHOWS  MURDAUGH PAUSED BRIEFLY IN THE  DRIVEWAY AT HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE  THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS HE TOLD THE JURY HE WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO LOCATE HIS PHONE. >> WERE YOU DURING THAT MINUTE  OR HOWEVER LONG IT WAS, WERE YOU DISPOSING OF MURDER WEAPON,  ALEX? >> NO. >> WERE YOU DISPOSING OF BLOODY  CLOTHES? >> NO. >> Reporter: ANOTHER KEY MOMENT, MURDAUGH EXPLAINING TO THE JURY  WHY EVIDENCE SHOWS HIM WEARING  DIFFERENT CLOTHES BEFORE AND  AFTER THE MURDERS. >> YEAH, I MEAN I SWEATED. I WAS, YOU KNOW, I WAS HEAVY AND TAKING PRESCRIPTION PILLS ALSO  MAKES YOU SWEAT WORSE OR AT  LEAST TAKING OXYCODONE MAKES YOU SWEAT MORE THAN YOU NORMALLY DO. >> SO WAS IT UNUSUAL FOR TO YOU  TAKE A SHOWER WHEN YOU GOT BACK  TO THE HOUSE? >> NOT AT ALL. >> Reporter: ON  CROSS-EXAMINATION, THE  PROSECUTION PUSHED BACK. >> YOU AGREE THAT THE MOST  IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY IS EXPLAINING YOUR  LIFE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF THAT  YOU WERE NEVER DOWN AT THOSE  KENNELS AT 8:44? WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT? >> I THINK ALL OF MY TESTIMONY  IS IMPORTANT, MR. WATERS. >> Reporter: THE STATE'S GOAL AT THE END OF THE DAY, OF COURSE,  WAS TO SET ALEX MURDAUGH UP AS A LIAR TO SHOW THE JURY THAT HE  CAN'T BE TRUSTED AND, WOLF,  THAT'S WHY THE PROSECUTION ON  CROSS-EXAMINATION RIGHT AWAY  WENT TO THOSE ALLEGED FINANCIAL  CRIMES BASICALLY TO SEND THE  MESSAGE THAT THE JURY THAT,  LOOK, IF HE CAN ALLEGEDLY LIE TO ALL THESE PEOPLES, ALL THESE  VICTIMS YOU COULD LOOK YOU IN  THE EYE AS THE JURY AND LIE TO  YOU AS WELL.  >> HE ADMITTED TO STEALING A LOT OF MONEY ALSO. RANDI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  >>> LET'S BREAK DOWN TODAY'S  EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY WITH OUR  LEGAL EXPERTS, JOINING US NOW  ATTORNEY AND LEGAL AFFAIRS  COMMENTATOR AREVA MARTIN AS WELL AS DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND FORMER  FEDERAL PROSECUTOR SHAN WU. AREVA, WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU  FROM THE CROSS-EXAMINATION SO  FAR AND EXCHANGES BETWEEN ALEX  MURDAUGH AND THE PROSECUTOR? >> I THINK, WOLF, IT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF A LIE. THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE MOTIVATED  THIS DEFENDANT TO TAKE THE  WITNESS STAND. THERE WAS GOING TO BE THIS  LINGERING QUESTION FOR THE  JURORS AS TO WHY IS IT THAT TEN  WITNESSES CAME FORWARD AND SAID  THAT THEY COULD IDENTIFY ALEX  MURDAUGH'S VOICE ON THIS  VIDEOTAPE BUT YET HE CONTINUED  TO TELL THE POLICE THAT HE  WASN'T AT THE KENNEL JUST  MINUTES BEFORE THE PROSECUTION  SAYS HIS WIFE AND SON WERE  KILLED. SO I THINK THAT EXCHANGE,  EVERYBODY WAS WAITING TO SEE  WHAT THE PROSECUTION WOULD DO  WITH THAT PIECE OF EVIDENCE AND  WE SAW WHAT I THINK WE EXPECTED, THE PROSECUTION WENT IN HARD ON  ALEX MURDAUGH ABOUT TELLING THAT LIE, NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE BUT  CONTINUING TO TELL THAT LIE  THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME  PERIOD REALLY UNTIL HE TOOK THE  WITNESS STAND TODAY TO TRY TO  GIVE US AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY  HE LIED. >> AND, SHAN, MURDAUGH ALSO  ADMITTED HE LIED -- HE ADMITTED  HE WAS AT THE SCENE JUST BEFORE  THE MURDERS. HOW BIG OF A GAMBLE IS THIS  TESTIMONY? IS IT A MISTAKE THAT HIS  ATTORNEYS ALLOWED HIM TO GO  AHEAD AND TESTIFY? >> WELL, IT'S A STRATEGIC CALL. I MEAN, AS I'M SURE AREVA KNOWS, IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT CHOICE AND DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR CLIENT ON THE STAND BECAUSE THEY'RE AT A  GREAT DISADVANTAGE. THIS SIGNALS THAT THEY WERE  CONCERNED THAT THAT AUDIO  EVIDENCE IS SO OVERWHELMINGLY  INDISCRIMINATORY THAT THEY HAD  NO CHOICE BUT TO PUT HIM ON THE  STAND. HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH THE FACT  THAT HE LIED ABOUT IT. HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH THE FACT  THAT THERE'S FINANCIAL LIES HE  COMMITTED. HE DEFRAUDED CLIENTS SO OPENS UP THIS WHOLE CASCADE OF STUFF HE  HAS TO ADMIT TO AND TRYING TO  TURN THAT INTO HE'S ADMITTING  ALL THESE OTHER THINGS BUT HE'S  A GOOD GUY. I DIDN'T THINK HE DID A VERY  CONVINCING JOB TODAY, BUT YOU  NEVER KNOW WITH A JURY. IT ONLY TAKES ONE. >> IMPORTANT, INDEED. AREVA, IS THE DEFENSE STRATEGY  TO PORTRAY MURDAUGH AS  SUPPOSEDLY SYMPATHETIC, A  SYMPATHETIC FIGURE? IS THAT STRATEGY WORKING? >> WELL, I THINK PARTS OF IT DID WORK, WOLF, BUT PARTS OF IT WERE NOT COMPELLING. HE CRIED A LOT ON THE WITNESS  STAND. HE WAS TEARY AT TIMES WHEN YOU  EXPECT HIM TO BE. HE USED THE NICKNAMES HE HAD FOR HIS WIFE AND SON TO SHOW THAT  THEY WERE VERY CLOSE AND, YOU  KNOW, HOW HE USED THESE TERMS OF ENDEARMENT TO DESCRIBE THEM. I AGREE THAT THERE WAS A HUGE  GAP IN THE DEFENSE'S CASE  BECAUSE OF THAT VIDEO, BUT I  STILL THINK THE PROSECUTION HAS  A PROBLEM TOO, WOLF. THEY HAVE NO GUN. THEY HAVE NO MURDER WEAPON. THEY DON'T HAVE AN EYEWITNESS SO ALL OF THEIR EVIDENCE IS  CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND WANT THE  JURORS OR NEED THE JURORS TO  BELIEVE THAT A MAN THAT WAS THAT CLOSE TO HIS WIFE AND HIS SON  WOULD BLOW HIS SON'S BRAINS OUT  SIMPLY TO DISTRACT FROM HIS  FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. NOW, CLEARLY THE MAN IS A LIAR,  HE IS A CHIEF, SO FAR BASED ON  THE EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN, YOU  KNOW, PRESENTED, BUT THAT'S A  BIG LEAP FROM I LIE AND I STEAL  MONEY TO I KILL A WIFE AND I  KILL A SON WHO CLEARLY FROM ALL  EVIDENCE HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO,  SO I THINK OF THEIR PARENTS ON  THAT JURY. I'M A PARENT. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE  SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD SAYING,  HMM, I DON'T KNOW. I MAY NOT LIKE THIS GUY, I MAY  NOT THINK HE'S THE MOST  HONORABLE PERSON BUT I DON'T  KNOW IF HE HAD IT IN HIM TO BLOW HIS SON'S BRAINS OUT.  >> MURDAUGH TESTIFIED ABOUT HOW  HIS OPIOID ADDICTION BEGAN. WHAT EFFECT DO YOU THINK THAT  WILL HAVE? >> WELL, THEY'RE TRYING TO USE  IT FOR POSITIVE EFFECT TO SHOW  HE HAD A PROBLEM. HE WAS SYMPATHETIC FOR TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH IT AND THAT THAT  MAY HAVE MADE HIM PARANOID AND  CAUSED HIM TO, YOU KNOW,  DISTRUST THE POLICE WHEN HE IS  TELLING THIS LIE. A LITTLE BIT OF A DOUBLE-EDGED  SWORD. THE PROSECUTION DOESN'T HAVE TO  RAISE THIS POINT BUT IF HE WAS  THAT ADDLED BY THE ADDICTION, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACTING VERY  IRRATIONALLY AT THE TIME AND THE JURY MIGHT BELIEVE THIS VERY  OPIOID ADDICTED PERSON WENT OFF  INTO THIS PARANOID FRENZY AND  DID SLAUGHTER HIS OWN FAMILY. SO IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD  BUT, AGAIN, IT'S SOMETHI"
_zeq8qzc7fQ,"abrdn Sees Opportunities in China, India, Southeast Asia","Pruksa Iamthongthong, Asian equities senior investment director at abrdn, discusses China's decision to delay the release of economic data, and the opportunities she sees in the region's stock markets. She speaks with Haidi Stroud-Watts and Shery Ahn on ""Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia.""",1,I have to ask this is the elephant in the room what's going on with the delay GDP and domestic activity numbers and how do investors read into this or do we not read into this I think the short answer is we do not read into this that much I think the expectation is that you know with all the lockdowns um GDP numbers is going to look pretty low and we think that overall there is a bit of a disconnect between when you look at what's happening at the macro level and what's happening at the micro level and that's where we think the market is being mispriced so yes we we will look forward to the numbers to come out but we don't look at it very much what are you looking at though when it comes to cautiously constructive on selected opportunities in China I hope that sort of covers your positioning but what what are you looking at what's a time frame what are the sectors and companies that are interesting to you yes we are looking out into us as Butternut stop kickers as well would be the fundamentals of the companies so it would be the earnings growth that these companies are generating and you know we talk about how the GDP numbers of China is going to decline below five percent this year but the companies in our portfolio are generating High Teens type of group and they are on their way to meet the expectation as well so so far I think selectively depending on where you play um the earnings growth other companies are actually quite healthy one area could be in the green economy side and this is really because the spending does go on regardless of what's happening to the GDP growth given that it is a policy Target but also we have seen a strong acceleration of the move towards renewable energy globally post Ukraine and Russia situation proxa is very enough confidence in your view on not only the China story but also the broader Asia Story by investors right now yes that's right and I think a lot of this is also due to how um China and Asia as a whole is a very unloved place at the moment and I think that's a lot of it is really boiled down to sentiment but we think that there are pockets of growth whether you look at you know the domestic Aid China a story whether you look at India India is growing um very strongly benefiting from economic growth posts the reopening of the economy and I think an under investment in India for for the last decade so we are seeing very strong story in India and then moving on to asean um again it's one that has been unloved for many many years but it's actually one that is benefiting from again reopening Tailwind some of the asean financials have done pretty well for us this year as well so I think given the overall environment we have to look harder and have to be very Discerning with regard to the quality of the companies but I think there are lots of opportunities us to pick the right stocks given that valuation has come down quite a fair bit what are you expecting for the current earnings season here in the U.S for example earning season provides a little bit of a boost usually for the equity markets what will learning season in Asia look like and what are you focusing on um I think we are not expecting any negative surprise from the earning season I think it's too early to call that we'll see a positive surprise from the current earnings season given the backdrop that we are in but I think fair to say that throughout the year earnings for Asian companies have gone through negative earnings revision given that they were at a high expectation earlier on the year so that has come down and I think we are at the stabilization phase what we are increasingly see which is an interesting observation from some of the companies is that cost pressure for them has come down and this is really because they have either repriced their products and have passed on the cost and then you see the raw material pressure coming down as well so margins are actually looking better for Asian companies and that should help with the bottom line
m1RI7QQlF2s,Can Blinken counter China's ties in Southeast Asia? | DW News,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Indonesia on the first leg of his visit to southeast Asia. Top of the agenda is Chinese influence in the region and Washington's attempts to counter it.

Blinken is expected to lay out the US approach in the region in a speech on Tuesday. The US is also keen on stepping up engagement with the 10-member Association of Southeast Nations or ASEAN, of which Indonesia is an active member.

Indonesia has very significant economic interests with China. China is Indonesia’s second largest foreign investor with investment reaching 4.8 Billion USD in 2020.

Chinese investment in Indonesia has increased every year since 2016. And last year, Indonesia’s exports to China increased to 37.4 billion USD. An increase of 10.10 per cent from 2019.

#AntonyBlinken #ASEAN #China",1,u.s secretary of state anthony blinken is in indonesia on the first leg of his visit to southeast asia top of the agenda is chinese influence in the region and washington's attempts to counter it lincoln is expected to lay out the u.s approach in the region in a speech on tuesday the u.s is also keen on stepping up engagement with the 10-member association of southeast asian nations or asean of which indonesia is a very active member and joining me now from jakarta is our asia pacific bureau chief georg matas georg the us sees china as a competitor what is the view in indonesia i'd say the few in indonesia uh the world's first most populous country dealing with china the most populous country in the world is a different one the economic ties of course with china here into indonesia are immense china is the second largest foreign investor in indonesia so there's a lot of economic interests and so the indonesians of course very well know why the americans are now turning towards southeast asia in order to gain more allies in in this geopolitical uh picture they're drawing of the region and knowing that china is seeking the same intention and uh so they will carefully listen what uh the uh american uh foreign secretary here uh will have to say but they must have some expectations as well so what are jakarta's expectations from this visit well obviously for the indonesians there's a number of things to gain from from the current situation and the tensions between us and china one possibility of course is the relocation of investment u.s investment in china to other southeast asian nations and that is where indonesia is hoping to gain its share then another opportunity that so far in the talks hasn't been mentioned at all but something that indonesia and generally nations in southeast asia are very keen to get is access to the u.s market so quite a lot of economic interest and then of course their strategic interest particularly if you look at the south china sea and there is also talk of the u.s strengthening engagement with asean and indonesia has been a key member of the grouping in past years how does jakarta see asean engagement with the united states asean from an indonesian perspective with the headquarters here in jakarta are hugely important of course particularly i already mentioned the south china sea and the chinese dominance there that is where indonesia is seeking you know structural support that is where they have an open ear when it comes to strengthening security infrastructure uh in the region uh publicly i would say that they wouldn't share this idea of a bullying chinese force but of course it is an important issue here and of course they're fully aware as well of the um of the strategic investment of submarines the orcas project that the united states and great britain have done with australia so all of this is where asean plays an important role as more of a neutral partner of many states that have vested interests in this regions to keep it fertile to keep it prosperous but also to keep it secure and stable georg matas in jakarta we leave it there for the time being but thanks so much for joining us today and as george mentioned earlier indonesia has very significant economic interests with china this relationship is worth taking a closer look at now china is indonesia's second largest foreign investor with investment reaching some 4.8 billion us dollars in 2020. chinese investment in indonesia has increased every year since 2016. and last year indonesia's exports to china increased to 37.4 billion us dollars an increase of 10.10 percent from 2019. now this economic interdependence obviously begs the question where does indonesia stand in relation to china and to help me answer that i'm joined in the studio by dw reporter clifford and clifford welcome you have looked at the region and you do follow developments in the region quite closely i therefore have to ask you does china have economic leverage over indonesia and particularly in terms of indonesia's position on china well i think it definitely has leverage um as as the figures have shown um there you know they've invested billions in power plants highways a high-speed rail link and there's a lot of investment coming in and it's very important to developing indonesia on the other hand indonesia is kind of unusual in that it's such a big player in the region itself so it has quite a lot of interest itself um in protecting its own interests so often it's made decisions which seem to go against the their economic interests particularly on strategic areas in the south china sea where they're competing over with china china's claiming drilling rights for oil and gas there um they've they've actually pushed back on that but generally china is such a big player that it does make it um it does make it a real challenge for indonesia to to push itself through but it's the same story across in other nations as well other asean member nations such as cambodia or laos right yeah it's interesting looking at lincoln coming down the the steps of the plane today you know he's he's got it it's such a diverse region and there's so many different issues at play you know you've got cambodia where junsen is at the moment about to appoint his trying to appoint his son as his successor and then you've got thailand who just had a military coup there's all these different issues at play um and the u.s is trying to deal with all these different kinds of issues um on the on the terms in which it knows it's it's quite you know ideological and pro-democracy in its approach but at the same time it has to protect its interests and try and regain some of the interest that it has frankly lost over the last few years to china which has been just much more active in the region we had four years of donald trump in which the u.s wasn't in the region at all uh or barely in the region at all and um so he's got his work cut out for him now where does that leave the united states i mean as you mentioned china has really made lots of inroads particularly when it comes to trade and actually providing money for infrastructure projects for example in across much of southeast asia where does that leave the united states how does the united states bring southeast asian nations like indonesia or malaysia on board if it wants to be seen as countering chinese influence in the region well i think one thing that um the u.s is has a lot of good will in the region i think it's um very popular with people a lot you know the us is still seen in many ways as as a kind of a standard um i don't you don't get the same sense of goodwill towards china for example at the same time um china beats this one message the whole time which it just brings the money and so it's going to come down to the us actually coming up with the money and providing um help to develop these infrastructure projects that are so needed and um and start moving towards maybe a bigger trade um basis we've seen biden mention that he wants a a trade platform for the region we don't know the details of that yet but it's going to be on things like it's going it's going to have to come up with the goods on trade interesting space to watch clifford kunam thanks so much for coming into the studio for that
lx0Vsw3DGt8,Investing for Immortality,"With auction sale values now reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, the return on investment on an art masterpiece can be tremendous. But more than a hefty profit, this asset class offers something that very few investment opportunities do: a shot at immortality. We remember the Medicis not only for their statesmanship or business acumen, but for their legacy as early supporters and patrons of Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, Sandro Boticelli, and other great masters of art. While the possibility of immortality is certainly there, the odds are tough. What are the risks and opportunities for investment associated with this growing asset class? What are the avenues for investment? What sets good art apart? How can art investors maximize their chances of earning a page in history?

#Immortalitly #Art #Philanthropy",1,"good afternoon everyone nice to see everybody here my name is Helen Lee Warren and it's my pleasure to welcome you all to the first Milken Institute art panel our topic today is investing in immortality and we our panel will be discussing art as an asset class and also art and how it pertains to investing and we're hoping to touch upon exciting trends in Asia such as private museums and philanthropy but before we begin I want to just before we introduce the panel I want to just give a little bit of a historical context to our discussion and talk about the Medicis who were a banking family and political dynasty in Florence Italy and who also wielded great cultural influence at the same time during the Renaissance the Medici bank was a highly prosperous and respected institution in Europe and the Medicis were considered amongst the wealthiest on the continent could we have the first slide please from their seat of power the Medicis created an environment in which art and humanism flourished they along with other banker merchant families invested vast sums of money for art and architecture and were patrons of some of the greatest artists and architects of all time among them and you can see on those screens we have Donatello's David Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa not in the order that I've said it but I think you can all figure it out which ones I'm talking referring to could we have the next slide please five centuries later their legacies remain as great patrons of the art here is Leonardo's Salvator Mundi the depiction of christ as savior of the world it's the most expensive work of art ever sold at us ever sold at auction is that right Ben yep at Christie's fetching 450 mm dollars last year moving forward to the present next slide please there's been an extraordinary growth in wealth since the global financial crisis and growth wealth growth in this region has far surpassed that of the West since 2014 the number of high net worth individuals here in Asia has surpassed that in both Europe and North America as a result some ultra high-net-worth Asians have turned to art as an asset class and perhaps are aspiring for more here are some examples next slide in 2014 Chinese collector you eat Chen successfully bid 281 Hong Kong million Hong Kong dollars or 36 million u.s. dollars for a rare porcelain chicken cut from the Cheng hua period here he's shown sipping tea out of the pricey little cup apparently owning a piece of dynastic history links a buyer directly to the greatness of the past next to him we have misawa's oops can we go back next to the lovely chicken cup we have the Misawa basquiat selfie in May of 2017 you saw kumazawa a billionaire Japanese art collector acquired this jean-michel basquiat work untitled from 1992 for a hundred and ten point five million dollars the highest price ever for both a u.s. artist and for a black artist and here's a picture of him posing in front of it right after acquiring the work this isn't his selfie picture but he did post it on Instagram as a selfie Misawa is an avid collector of contemporary art and plans to build a museum in chiba east of tokyo so I'm now very pleased to introduce our exceptional group of panelists they are all pioneers in their field and also they come from very disparate areas of the art market so I'm hoping that they're gonna have a chance to explain why they've come into the positions or wife they've discovered the exciting parts of art world that they're presently in I'm gonna start to my right with mr. Ben Clark deputy chairman of Christie's Asia hi Ben Christie's was the first international Western auction house to hold independent sales in mainland China very exciting Ben is a seasoned auction house veteran who understands the art market and collectors tastes and desires especially in Asia so Ben how did you come to be in the auction world and find your way in Asia I started off as a student she's a frustrated architect so I always have been interested in and how things looks and the art world is very much part of who I was I then found myself as a post-grad working in a museum in Chicago at the Art Institute of Chicago for two years which is where I cut my teeth in learning about artworks and learned how to look at art and it was from there that has sort of blossomed and I went back to London and worked at Christie's as a post grad and has have done many different things at Christie's ever since and most recently moved to Asia in the last two years what do you think sets the auction world apart from the rest of the art world I don't think it's I don't think it's set apart from the art world I mean that several of us were talking earlier the art market is an ecosystem it's a word that we all talk about and like any marketplace you need all component parts of that ecosystem for the market to flourish and from my perspective Christie's is just one segment of that that ecosystem so you obviously can start with let's say the artists and then you have patrons and then you have collectors and they can all be slightly different and varying and they're there what I would classify as the enablers of the art market they are the people that are to use an ugly word producing what we're all talking about and then you have slightly more commercial side so advisors gallerists like auction houses and then you have the education sector which is museums private or public and then governments play a huge part in this how a government decides in any given country to ensure that the art market is open to its population or what they might vest in it has a significant parts play again in that whole ecosystem soon so Elizabeth you are the senior director of art and culture at the Iowa Museum and Foundation and tell us a little bit about the Ayala and how long you've been there and what makes it a special place I think I've been with the Ala for about five six years now and what drew me to the place is really the ability to be able to make art and culture more accessible so we are a nonprofit and when you asked me about immortality I said well maybe that's the aspects of this equation that will address how works of art become immortal because I think in institutions like museums where they are there for generations for people to appreciate then maybe there is a chance to do that and a lot of it really has got to do with making people want to come to see it I come from a market where you know museum going isn't top of mind so we go through hoops to try and get people engaged with art and culture because it speaks about themselves and so that that becomes the challenge now for this aspect of the ecosystem it was established in 1967 which is relatively an earlier time for a heritage museum like yours to come to be such an important player because the the the principles or the ayala family are have always been supporters of art and culture and so they were one of the first if not the first to establish a private museum and it has since grown to include among other things a fabulous pre-colonial Gold Collection from the no to the 13th century visual arts in addition indigenous textiles and ceramics so it is it is a bit encyclopedic but we are by no means a National Museum the collection that defines this museum was started by the owners and from there we have grown it over time so true drew Cattle is the founder of Jew kataoka studios your japanese-american and your visual artist crossing traditional boundaries of art and technology I know you've presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos and you've also exhibited your art at the International Space Station and you are a speaker yesterday at the women's summit here so tell us a little bit about your practice you're actually in California and Silicon tell us about where you are and how you work in a way that your studio is yes so I am based in Silicon Valley which i think is this incredible creative geyser I mean Silicon Valley is the Paris and New York of today without question and it's an incredible place to be creating arts I've built a very successful art practice and a thriving business there and my art collectors are technologists entrepreneurs venture capitalists and they are really interested in an art that is really something that can stimulate their creativity and that can really make them think and so you know I am the CEO of my own business I'm running a business you know I I'm responsible for all my employees I have skilled artisans and computer programmers and 3d CAD designers all working for me so at the at the end of the day I have to make sure that we keep the lights on and keep everything going but what separates me from a typical business person selling widgets is that at the end of the day I'm an artist first and foremost and my measuring stick is immortality and that's one of the things I'm thinking about with respect to this panel but in my work over the years I have integrated a lot of Technology and I think that technology is really the heartbeat of our time so I have done works with EEG with brainwaves I'm working a lot with virtual reality right now I'm a some residents for Google VR tilt brush and I'm part of Facebook oculus Launchpad and and I'm doing a lot of different things that are at this really rich intersection of art science and technology and I want to talk to you more about how your business operation is out of the normal or everyday typical realm of the Nexus of dealer gallery or even the way you exit it it's not the same way that other artists might yeah so we'll come back to that because definitely not least at all but last we have pearl am the founder of an owner pearl am galleries pearl I think everybody knows you from your years of being a driving force within Asia's contemporary art scene working with artists and collectors from around the world you're a pioneering gallerist in more than one way an iconoclast the one of the first women and one of the first pipe orders of western contemporary art in asia and you also have a foundation which I didn't know about which is very exciting because you're you're supporting contemporary Chinese art and culture that you've played a part in creating me can you tell us a bit about why you've decided at what age or how you came about your idea to be such an important gallerist and support Western contemporary actually when I came back I was sent away to study when I was 11 and when I returned back to alcohol I did not know what I want to do but the only thing I know know what I want is I don't want to have my family influenced in any career that I want to devote so it's also kinda forward when you first decided that you're working I love art I love art I love art art is a passion but to turn a passion into a career you need to be very fortunate to do that so at the time when I returned back to Hong Kong actually it's I mean Hong Kong Asia there is no really there's no art market as new art movement Contemporary Art is pretty I mean known and known interesting and and so anyway my of course my parents begin very Chinese parents they said absolutely no over my dead body so I was sent to China to do a property development and lucky enough because I was in China I couldn't even speak a word of Mandarin but because I was in China and met Chinese artists and then by default I enter into the Chinese world and I went to China with a very colonial attitude not unknowingly I was really cool and and adopting this colonial attitude so after years listening to them learning really about Chinese culture then I realized the importance of Chinese culture and that is one of the reason why I started that and that foundation but by the and while I was doing that I was also doing pop-up shows in Hong Kong this was one of my ago she Asian with my with my father and I started this pop-up show in 1993 the reason why I choose to be a gallery rather than doing a museum a foundation because my beside our passion in art is I love to grow a career of an artist should grow a career of an artist not just to build a market but you have to build credentials so I have to place artworks in museums and at the same time I have to build the market without building in a market auction house wouldn't even look at house because they would only look at artist who has a certain market and of course we as a galleries and auction house we are enemies I know because artists doesn't want us to have any works in the auction house it was one of the thing is one of the things one of the many artists said if if I work if you don't protect our works our works is an auction house we are out we won't have any any relationship I mean there's different ways of working I mean Weston is always different but at the time it was much more simple than now and so I I wanted to get involved in art well I love talking to artists because of the artists I learned to become a Chinese because being abroad for so many years and being in Hong Kong is I didn't understand Chinese culture so it sounds like you were from a very young age determined to make your way no it was it was even art person because I really love art but I didn't know what to do with it and you found your way as again and I find my way as a galleries and I also because my relationship with all the artists I realized that what I would love to is to make to make known of these artists in the West I mean in the Ling rational world and also and also Chinese art yeah the movement exactly so I want to ask all of you to start the ball rolling we can see we have sort of disparate perspectives on the art market and the art world in general so what does it take these days if you're a high net worth individual or not yet quite a high net worth individual to start a collection or make an impact in the current art market I just want to build on what pearl was saying I think it really starts with the artist knowing the art yes you don't just buy something and you don't understand what was what was behind it I think no and I'm sure Drew is must feel that too that it really all starts with knowing the artist and some of the biggest collectors that I've heard about make their selection based on is absolutely true I think this is a museum we're talking okay I know yeah I call speculators clutches and shopaholics all right you have to differentiate there are many many investors and speculators they would just buy the art and put it in a crate they never even see it right they said that because their people always asking me hey pearl you know I want you to buy a Chinese I mean and art in I read I know that in the 2007 I mean that that era that decades some of the artworks went up a hundred times how am I going to do it I said you have this setter sit on your piece of art for 10 30 years you definitely get it if you buy a great great eight paintings seven but I literally know people who is I mean who really doesn't even know art doesn't love art but they buy just for investment it was in the creek for years never going back to the question though so let's say that you are a wannabe collect or a beginning collector or an advanced collector how what are the ways to meet artists or to learn about I will first of all is I will talk to the person who wants the buyer whether you are really a collector or whether you are speculators we don't sell to speculators what's the difference between a collector in a spectrum we don't like we don't like people coming in to us and buying art and flipped us so that the reason the pearl will have that yes exactly is because she's looking to protect the artist yeah we have to protect that Contemporary Art Gallery you of course protect the artist who you don't want that artists outer of the answers to be control and it can't be a short-term thing and has to be a long-term thing so you're protecting that market if you're not collecting contemporary art which is then there are many other different ways of doing it whether it's auction or through advisors or dealers and that's the difference we see in a jar is that this year Christie's 60% of vision spend the sort of 60% of the Asian spend within Christie's globally has been a non Asian art contemporary facility and actually when most Asian collectors start off at Christie's they come in with western blue chip artists because they feel confident about the you know the classic tenants of when you start collecting quality history of the provenance of the work of Arts at the authenticity and these things are well documented for let's say blue chip we can't Picasso etc etc whereas the contemporary artist there's a whole lot more education that used to go on and you need the gallerist or the artists themselves to educate but when ancestors dead that's a lot more complicated no but but when the artist is dead it's also a problem because if the artist is dead you don't have a foundation to keep on promoting that then they will be forgotten how many artists has been forgotten and all of sudden like mother well Robert Motherwell was really great American school artists and then when he died because of the foundation fighting he was forgotten and then it was the galleries again remarketing rebooting them in and in the whole market and then the price side could be complicated when I saw that the title of Hannity actually I think it's about mortality I think people collect because they want to be mortal and they might have a glimpse of their most absolutely more it's the artists that become immortal by virtue of the art they create and that depends on whether they can remain in but not necessarily just the artists because it won't work if you look but if you look at King Tutankhamun which is one of the most like the other funerary works it's one of the most immoral works of all time we don't really remember the artists but they did such a great job that we certainly common and he wasn't very he wasn't even one of the greatest Pharaohs the artwork is so great we remember the visualizations so for example the Medicis the only reason they were when you talk about a Medici collector in general now we refer to collectors who buy big-ticket items but they also buy across categories and not just consume money they will also say the Medicis themselves Medici yeah they were their patrons of content contemporary artists but they were also collectors of they look to the Past they were collectors of Byzantine mosaics and gold coins from ancient Greece then let's go back to the statistic you were giving us from Christie's so 60% of Christie's clients are now collecting we are know 60% of the Asian spend at Christie's so it's the value no now you are valued is none Asian rocks could be old masters Europe Western old masters it could be and in the answer so the entire market in Asia apparently has grown from a hundred and eight million dollars to two hundred and ten million dollars over the past five years so yeah that put it another way in 2008 so ten years ago it represented I think 12% of our of our annual sales and last year 2017 it was 32% so what is the what is the reason do you think behind the growth of the contemporary market here in Asia given what you're saying that I don't think it I don't think there is a great contemporary market it's not it is growing but it's a growth of electing and and a growth of passion amount art and looking to the past the present with an eye to the future so the Medicis looked at the past in the present with a nod to the future I think the same thing is happening with collectors in Asia they are looking to the Past you know there's also we were at a time listening to other panelists today where a very transitional moment in mainland China in particular where we're second generation wealth is coming about first generation collectors in Asia often collected Chinese works of art classical ink paintings as you'd expect well that market is apparently growing as well that market is maintaining it's not as growing as fast as no not nearly as fast it's still there but the children are often go straight because they've been educated by Western art and they are all by household name art and especially which is quite shortly is they are only late 20s early 30s with a budget of like 2 million US per work yeah well this is how they're buying it I mean it's so so shocking they're only buying Western big names without knowing about about really knowing purple it's a good idea is this something that should be is the evolution of a of a economy and hopefully that and after they buy all these and they start collecting it they become interested and turned to be a better collector that's what you know I mean I really for me is I've been through my era when people has completely not not interested in art and to now that everybody you know when we sit on a dinner table they talk about art and if anybody wants to collect anything for whatever reason is a good start well let's talk about trends though I understand what you're saying that there's a younger generation who is eager to get in the market and to learn about artists but are there any trends to keep an eye out for certain types of artwork or names is it no it's a social life so if one person said that they value one artist the that's a gang that they will fall hope and buy any samples of something that's happening today or the style or an artist I mean Impressionism is that blue teapot that everyone dives into I think Impressionism is the older generation I mean is the older generation I knew all these late twenties early and early 30s they were buying condo they were buying jollywood's I mean they were just but they still buy any person person is amoeba cancer as well oh yes of course but I but I thought those are I mean what I see is there was up much older although generally not not the late 20s early 30s yeah I have differing opinion everybody can have a different opinion about that but I think what's interesting though and I agree with miss pearl that the dynamism of the art world here in Asia even if it's not all for the right reason yet I think he's yeah but I hope the major hurdle let me is it good I mean it's stuff over time ideally if they get serious then they will become more informed because there's so much information available now you don't have to really get a degree you can you can read a little bit boring yes nope else earlier points and so you're just saying I don't see while the yet this younger generation is spending a lot of money and seeing what's about I don't see them making bad decisions so it's not like when I've in the mid-2000s when some parts of Europe were by rashly for high prices and flatted prices for a period of three or four years and then they just stopped you think it's a educated mass education much more intelligent informed decisions they're not overspending they're not inflating a bubble specific I think that they passed an era because in the 2000s one I know of I've seen people buy all these big names like Dali Rodin and all that and they don't even know what is a live cast or what there's a performance cars or they don't even have authentication so today we moved on so I think it's but we're still not getting any specific answers about artists or trends that are going to be helpful in you I'd be buying a myself exactly Baiju because I find what you're doing and your practice very very exciting you're not only on the cutting edge of the type of art that you'd produce but the way you operate is also very interesting as well can you tell us a little bit about that yeah and I I love the the topic of this panel because in terms of the Medicis I mean there were many people who were great bankers but we really do remember the Medicis because they nurtured and enabled him and and brought into the world this great art and you said Ben you were saying that they look to the Past they give a nod to the future I would say that it's more than a nod because the type of artists that they empowered we're on the cutting edge and Michelangelo and Leonardo I'm changing the boundaries and so they were like a state of the art of the art so for me actually my model is is is quite different and in in Silicon Valley it's funny because you see all of this press that comes out like oh the Silicon Valley elite is not buying arts and actually that is not true there they're not buying art from galleries there so the galleries are really struggling but they're buying a lot of directly commissioned art and so that is what I do I two-thirds of the work that I do is directly privately commissioned and so when Elizabeth you were talking about this relationship with the artist it's it's so important and it's so it's so powerful because if you commissioned a work of art it's an on demand created just for you piece which means if you commissioned it you're responsible for bringing it into the world so that's really really very exciting closely aligned to the patron it's very its yeah yeah it's I mean the idea of a gallery actually it's a it's a we forget because most of the art world is galleries that it's actually a relatively recent phenomenon it's only like in the past hundred years that we have had art galleries but the gallery is really something that was modeled perfect in the United States and and took a lot of inspiration from retail boutiques it's essentially retail and and and as such it has some different characteristics such as standardization to sell something very very unique is very very difficult in a retail context and and branding you know a Prada bag should look like a Prada bag a mile away a Rothko should look like a Rothko from space but the problem is that some of these retail born characteristics are in direct conflict with immortal arts because like if you look for example your first slide the Sistine Chapel if you look at the Sistine Chapel that was really an experiment in fresco painting for Michelangelo who is the king of marbles it was a total experiment and if he had been if Michelangelo had had a gallerist at the time it's gallerist would probably have told him to stick to his marbles and not go out and branch out so much so I think that you know the Commission model is is tremendously interesting and it I say it's a little bit like the movie Back to the Future right Back to the Future we're going back to this old model that we had with the Medicis which in the history of art all the greatest masterpieces that we've ever had that most all of them have been this direct Commission model and it's it's the history working incredibly well in slokas now in the history of Westerner yes because effectively where the canons of Western art have been dictated and I work in the context dictated entirely by the church and by the real the real patrons of art in the West have always been an aristocrat and it's not the same in you know you look at ya Edo period Japan when the greatest works of arts are ceramics or the screens from the United busy decor to the 16th century indeed female permission then by the Monarchs and it's always about leaders and so yes it's good but I I think you know to your point you what you're doing with this as a studio and it tends to be sculptors interesting that when I look at Gormley yourself joining us concerto pull up slide number seven okay then you know and you look at one of us can tell us they you all by virtue of what you're creating need a big team it's an artist studio creating all of this yeah because commissioning I mean if you do commissioning you work with your owner or work with the person who commissioned you to build the piece together is like an architecture you need to have that link link but many of these when we do commissioned pieces they are either flew and our consultant as well many of these in the general world is our concern I don't know about Silicon Valley but but when you know when we look at these a lot of these Len art a lot of these if it is not the galleries going in it will be an art consultant going in linking the artists to work with a developer or work with the owner but many of these owners or people Commission doesn't have this art talk they are not interested they're only interested with a piece of work so at the end you will be talking to a curator creating the piece of work but that's a lot of middlemen and that's really that's really a problem I think one of the things that's really exciting about like the commission model is in in in in like e-commerce terms its dtc or direct-to-consumer so the amount of overhead that i cut out is incredible and I can pass that value and but you are assuming that the consumer knows about art but many of the consumer or many of the collectors I know they don't know art and also they don't have to fitties to talk to them to the artist who you meet this doll or absolutely right so therefore they will always have a curator all the calories will come well and try to translate so this is interesting so this is like a really big contrast and it is that this idea of the lack of confidence that's something that I see a lot more like with more like New York people like they're always like oh is this the right thing like this is the right now because it's simple that I'm supposed to have on my wall and like the Silicon Valley tycoons like I mean these are people who are like pretty much changing the face of artificial intelligence they kind of have confidence in what they think is gonna stimulate their creativity it's gonna inspire them and they just have a really like they have incredible gut instincts and they really kind of don't really go for all of the art mumbo-jumbo but they're incredibly smart they have incredible aesthetics we have some the best art collectors in the world and they're also really exciting to work with that what you're talking about that personal link but I think Silicon Valley must be very different because whole of America when I go to America what shocked me is everyone has an art advisor every so well I think that's the subject unto itself but it I mean is it is it is Silicon Valley loud really a different and making sure that people feel comfortable with knowing about their artwork and I wanted to ask Elizabeth about your role right as a museum director and what you do in educating the public and making sure you get as many people audience yes so I think that that that is probably half or three-fourths of what we do is really to find ways to make as I mentioned earlier art accessible now that's either you do lectures you were workshops you allow the interface with with the with the artists to happen and in the sense that has sort of shaken also the traditional role of museums you know it used to be sake you know it used to be like it was a place of worship for a secular art you know it's like you know people go there and they alternate Church and they and they worship know now the challenge is for museums to mine what they have and and be able to create meaning with these collections so that it connects with today and what the issues are we work with many people other artists like drew to be able to make that happen and also to allow the regular man on the street to believe that there's something new all the time that's coming in you know the problem is is when you have a collection people will just say oh I've seen it and and they'll never come back and you do a lot of cross-cultural and yes Museum loans to other museums a lot of that is it's also important because you need to have relationships with museums across the world because then we exchange and because of exchange then we know a little bit more about each other's culture so that that is a whole dynamic that I think has changed for museums and I think it happened about 20 years ago when somebody said it's no longer about something it's being for someone so that that sort of led museum practitioners step out of a cloud and begin to think of how to do this a museum development is really quite an exciting space we work again within an ecosystem so I do work with auction houses and work with galleries I work with with artists to make that happen so it's not a sleepy place and it's not a quiet Church I know you've expanded now into the visual arts as well as just heritage and culture right so tell us about experiences with working with direct artists do you have Philippine art yes well there are what we do is we work with Filipino artists and we do give them an opportunity to show in the museum generally there are mid-career artists we don't we have an another gallery for emerging artists but I think what that does is it allows the general population to see more of their work because what we notice is and it's true some of the best works are in the possession of collectors but nobody sees it I mean I have committee have worked with collectors who have allowed me to showcase their collections at the Museum and they are absolutely thrilled when young students come up to them and say thank you we would have never seen this if you hadn't loaned to us to that to this museum so in that sense this immortality business takes shape many of my friends who are collector suddenly realized whereas before they would be afraid to share their collection I said you don't have to build Museum if you're not yet ready but you know you can share it well I'm glad you brought up the idea of immortality and building museums yes because apparently this statistics show that it's becoming a very popular and big trend in in China I think drive it music users are asked of the rules I doubled I think the exponential growth 3000 well if you look at private museums in the West that were created during if we look at the Britain in particular China basically well during the sort of thing of the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century when Britain had a bit of cash yeah and people were doing exactly the same thing and there are hundreds of private museums if you look at them a hundred years later they're all either government government owned clothes the collections have been disbursed the longevity stroke immortality yeah of private museums is so much more complicated than just buying our so right and putting it in a museum it is the sustainability of the museum requires an audience right and unless you have an audience which dictates and also a budget for exhibition program audiences and generally speaking when it comes to private museums and the principles have to be committed I mean they originally probably built museums to house their collections but I noticed that as they become more enlightened then they realize that there is much more benefit to keeping it interesting for private museums that are owned by big tycoons for example they realize it gives you some kind of soft power if you use the art also in other fashion in another fashion which is what I think it's more of a mortal so I wanted to just correct myself and go back to something that been said apparently in 2006 there were only 1500 museums in and now that they're over 4,000 so and growing and in addition they're very interesting institutions that have come across in a very global international way I know we've spoken about m+ and booty texts used Museum in Shanghai has just made a collaborative partnership with LACMA it is a difficult operation this you have a museum you have to have very energetic young people Airy expensive as well it's highly creative I must say I mean it many people suddenly realize that you need really people who can think fresh I do I think I think one of the biggest problems that museums are grappling with is again adopting technology they're not harnessing technology to its full power and you always have this problem with collections that you're always showing the tip of the iceberg and I think what we will see with the full realization of virtual reality is that you will be able to compress huge artworks and give a fully immersive experiences and transport them all over and be able to give more surface area to care to your collection yes but to in order to be able to do that we need to be able to train people at the beginning of the pipeline who are going into the art world whether they are artists or people who are wanting to go into art on the institutional side to be more tech savvy so you know artists and institutional people in the institutional art world need to integrate more with that early on interesting drew is a like at our Museum we're a small museum but we've adapted VR in in one of our historical exhibitions and the moment we put it out there the texture of the audience that came through the museum the youth just came in with no problem because the interface was something they understood it's more negative and so it was really very interesting to watch and now we're expanding yeah but again the limitations of that are there finite number of youth in any given place city vocational ography surely the advantages of technology in looking at art is to as you say and I know nothing about this but I once met a Google guy that showed me something they have pixelated something so the Sistine Chapel apparently Google have now photographed at the end agreed such agreed that you can zoom in to like that much and see the new computer screen and see it exactly and it's the question of how you digital eyes and promote and allow a global audience to see these things that otherwise would have been impossible to see no haze incredible thing you're exactly right and the thing with the Google cultural code is do ya Google Institute which is amazing and I know some of the people there is is that interestingly you can make the argument that in some cases it's better to look at something on Google Cultural Institute than to see it in person like notices like Lisa and every there's 500 people in front of you you run by or the Sistine Chapel you know it's a bit up to say that close right there is quite experiencing here in the morning in lie on the floor and look up and that's talking about you know when you mention about the private museum in China and and all that but we have to dis to distinguish whether a museum of a collection or is this a constellar which is just no collection just exposure our audience could you explain to me and everybody else what you mean by the difference between a museum and the private museum okay when privately I mean at the brow china started with the private museum it was in 2000 when China got got when when China was nominated to be to have the to have the Olympics held in China in 2008 they find out that there's not enough cultural destination so China's Beijing Beijing yeah I go Chang I'm talking about 2000 so and so China government award anybody who can open museums that will create cultural destination so all of a sudden all these property developer went in and apply for museum in the name of Museum so when after tonight when 2008 happens many of the museum's SOCOM museum has no collection has no exhibition program just a museum name inverted commas alright so with that happening then Chinese government get more anxious and more concern so now it will be it is better but still there are museum just with the name maybe two paintings or one exhibition in three years so there are many of these so-called museums that doesn't perform as a museum now there is a museum of a collection there's a museum as a consolidating that it is a space and it is a space for exhibitions so each of these museum will have a very strong suppose the an exhibition program that will fill up the year of I mean and the whole year of exhibition then you have museum with collections so you can have your own collection which is showing but just showing your collections meaning this with our curatorial direction so most of these museum like yours will would choose different artworks and give a curatorial directions to enhance the understanding of the art movement so when we're looking towards the future and looking for artists who will theoretically test the last the test of time what are some aspects that we should look for in terms of how they're shown and how they work and what their mode of operation is in terms of whether they want to be in museums or whether they have a secondary market is there some sort of guideline that you have to have all the above is we will be all touched on this ecosystem it's it's a symbiotic relationship between artists if there's live the artwork is actually integral to all this the galleries the agency the curator the auction house because you need a primary in the central market to survive that's just a fact you can belong in someone's wall as an artwork and then you can be a decorations down through generations and by the second or third generation everyone's gotten what it is and you've lost the meaning unless there's a proper educational Oh heritage that the family are passing on and so things can get lost very quickly so you need to ensure that an artist or an art work is published or is exhibited and in a meaningful museum because so all of the above every day above it every single and where you see countries in Asia was I started to tour the countries that don't have the full ecosystem are the ones that don't have a burgeoning market and I don't ask me which ones okay I'm not going to put down a record let me turn the question around where is there a burgeoning ecosystem and where is that where's the direction of in Asia currently nowhere as rich as say in the West you've had six hundred years those obvious you know Hong Kong is getting at it very Korea's very good soul so Taiwan Taipei I pay has good museums and artists and galleries and auction houses you need all of those all of the above that's right so Elizabeth where you are in the Philippines and in terms of trying to grow your museum which I know that we've spoken about that you were trying to do how do you reach out to artists and the public to bring it bring more attention to your museum as I said when we use technology in our own way drew and I said we went we've used virtual reality we have our own app we're not integrated been has used virtual reality right and we're not afraid yeah I mean this thing about even taking photographs and sharing it reveals so major yeah for many museums obvious is the next staff you know we have to be over there for it you know virtual reality is gonna change the way we work play sleep govern everything of course I know that's it's the future all right the art world we are all prepared to take the next step because you know the digital has changed a way that that how you sell art as well so the next day visiting Museum in via is the next step of course it is would you like the words might actually close I mean the contrary thing about that is it may well stop real visitors right now but I think would happen that will be entirely too difficult for me it allows you to this will beyond the walls of your museum but that's what you want you want more people to know but the museum becomes a repository but now museum needs money so they need a ticketing so there always one audience visitors visitors visitors international it's the same discussion as books and Kindle and it's like some it evolves like books for some people are now you buy a hard copy because you want a souvenir but you will would read out of your Kindle oh yeah I'm excited that way so I think but it hasn't it hasn't killed the book for me or you know but I saw its little over industry the publishing industry is nearly finished attorney the question that we're sort of looking at museums to you in in terms of the bricks and mortars how do you feel about the sort of mid-range or the younger galleries having a high level of closure or difficulty in operating because of this increase we are digital and bio and actually we are not doing and I know you know what when you say that it's difficult for the midium galleries and as such is the market as of today the market is not a great market for for mid-sized galleries things like the high prices and the statin or was a bye-bye household names because the the financial market is an instance table when it is unstable collectors wants to buy big names young girl art is for a younger household name yeah doesn't even need to be blue chip as such household names so nearly all younger artists are completely strikeout okay the mid-career artist is in our time as well but this is a face that one goes through but with the digital actually it's helping you to sell art because there's so many websites early on I think online with Christie's they're all selling so that is a helpful tools because is not direct because we're not talking about block away you don't know yet but so you're saying that it's a complementary way it is a commentary' way but but is it because now galleries use social media to promote artists on you have digital sells on a certain level price range of our of your artworks on digital or on online I've been selling hard work through JPEG since early 2008 but that's alright and then and then also of course nowadays everybody is in artsy is it all these different a different website you beside decide to I do that as well but we don't do with every single artist we do with with some artists which is not of a high price but Helen you're asking her about bricks and clicks and bricks and mortar and Michael Milken showed a fantastic slide this morning in the global capital market session and it showed that from 2006 to 2008 een all of these big retailers except except Walt excepting out Walmart their market cap dropped by 50% so like you know retail is struggling that's talked about trends that's a huge trend and that just inevitably bubbles down to the art world and that's why I believe that the know the odds will model is actually incredibly strong and is going to be I mean Silicon Valley is just such an amazing place when you want to look at the future of any industry I mean time and time again it's shown that you know things happen there first and and other other other play other regions follow so I really think I believe it's the future circle it is but I actually I was that that handle to but actually art will the art market grows until 2 or 1/3 to 1/4 right yeah it was it was expended in such an incredible way there was a room for everything it was shocking mortar galleries like yours I mean I mean Alice Morgan that's why all the small galleries we keep popping up after 2012 everything because 2006 I mean 2008 2009 a lot of smaller calories closer but by 2013 Smuggler's shots coming up again okay so I'm still not satisfied about trying to get hurt for answers more than any of you in the last 10 minutes ten minutes what Mike Milken called a speed round so I wanted to ask each one of you what is your favorite artist or show that you've seen recently it can be anywhere in the world just what's stuck in your mind or what are you thinking about these days in terms of an artist's work or particulars exhibition say a favorite show a favorite artist is too difficult to come out just something one thing that is one thing that strikes me the Christie's is doing the minute we're selling an artwork in the middle of October a print that is touching on points we talked about earlier which is generated by AI so VR for me is all about marketing experience and all that we're now selling a painting that is completely generated from an algorithm and it's by a collective group of people called obvious the paris-based and they it's about four or five individuals they wrote an algorithm they fed in 16,000 images of portraits over six which were painted from the 15th century to the current day and they generated this image and and we're selling that at auction it's the first time anything like that's ever come onto the open market certainly as I consider a secondary markets well as he said this is where there are slight disagreements on the panel we sell primary artists at auction but we sell them for a price point that is below what a gallery may are the weight sell them for so this is going on the market of seven to ten thousand US dollars estimate estimate make me more the signature is the algorithm ins so script because that is what the computer decides this is the first time I first times ever happened so if I think and how it might disrupt the art world not necessarily the commercial side I think that is will become a more exciting thing what do you I still don't know so then this is something that you are very excited I would I think it's highly unusual never heard of it before they're challenging the whole idea of aesthetics and can computer generates cultural endeavors fantastic so I think that's a fairly phenomenal fortune ion for the upcoming sale when is October October 20th so Elizabeth the same question for you exhibitions show or some piece a specific artwork that sticks in your mind that you've seen I think I think the one that's stuck to my mind and it's been since since I saw it an Art Basel DIA you know the group called Tim Team lab yes I love Tim lab but I'm not talking because of the technology it was more the emotional experience that I encountered and it was through what I would have considered but I've expected to be a cold medium which is it was I've explained what that is for audience yeah what what happened was they did it was a video presentation of sorts of flowers and leaves and it was a lush depiction of a beautiful space of you know just flora and fauna and somehow when you got closer to it it all wilted and it just tells you and of course it's all about ecology and how man has sort of destroyed his environment but it was a very emotional experience and and it was through a medium that I didn't expect to be most yeah they're not from and I say it was it was um that stuck and and they've and I've been following their their their careers and their developments and I think they just built a new museum just for their for their long secondary market it's all right yeah it's really an amazing experience and you would and then you say ah are they selling in secondary market now I know there's potential and how about you where did he been well I was in Rome a couple months ago and saw the Pieta which always brings me to tears and I said this yesterday but I am absolutely confident that if Michelangelo was alive today he would be working in virtual reality I mean can you imagine the Sistine Chapel of the ceiling you know the creation scene in virtual reality or the Last Judgement that the souls ascending in heaven or being tortured and descending into hell imagine that in virtual reality Leonardo da Vinci most certainly would be working in artificial intelligence I mean he was legendary for these incredible to-do lists which were things like today I'd like to take the measurements of the Sun I'd like to go talk about non Euclidean geometry with a mathematician friend of mine I want to go inflate the lung of a pig and see which part of it inflates and my personal favorite which is I want to go every Saturday to the hot bath to go view naked men observe the naked men right so this kind of intellectual curiosity is just so amazing when we look at those artists from the Renaissance but I mean as an artist your measuring stick is immortality these great artists Michelangelo and Leonardo sand and the Picasso's but I think one of the things that's really a fascinating question is that if we we go back to let's say you know the time of the artists who are creating the funerary works for King Tutankhamen they were hoping to create something that would last one to three thousand years four thousand years that would last forever and that would be something that would be significant for gods and humans but today when we ask ourselves how do we create something that will truly be immortal we have a much more difficult question much more difficult question because in 3,000 years we will most definitely have general artificial intelligence so if we want to create something immortal we have to make something that is not going to only appeal to humans it's going to have to appeal to artificial intelligence because we will have reached AI consciousness by that point so that's something to wrap your head around think about yeah talk that ending the question I can't top that Oh recently uh I think one of one of the exhibition which enlightened me was the exhibition I went about Monet and abstract expressionism I never recognized that the later part his later period of money was was I mean has inspire the American Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s oh so I was completely gaga over Japanese artists Marigny I mean and then you realize that when you see the little stroke and the gesture and then you realize that then you think about all those those Jackson Pollock Rothko then it seems that the dots are connected so for me this is this is the most enlightening thing because I would have never think that a Monet and that abstract expressionist Lee the history of the influence of Asian art on West exactly exactly exactly insane and it was really me I mean for me is I just before I went to that exhibition I was in a geometry exhibition so I saw this Asian and then and so I for all these dots for me is if you I mean so excited wonderful things for us to think about and probably possibly go visit and look at before I asked if there are any questions I just wanted to throw out this idea that there are a lot more opportunities and players and multiple of multitude of ways to try to achieve immortality through art these days there's a lot to see a lot to learn - you know collectors interested in building a legacy have a chance for investing in immortality in a multitude of ways compared to the Medicis of the Renaissance before we end the panel does anybody have any questions for our esteemed speakers no he's going to go and look at all these wonderful shows and go visit been at Christie's to bid on his a IP so I just like to thank you or someone that I have a quick question it's to do with technology I remember I recall last year there was a panel discussing blockchain technology in Asheville I'm wondering in the panel's view on that with regards to technology and and we'll let change the art world at all I think that's a great question I'm not prepared to answer that then if there's blotchy it's something that it will be completed it's very much taking it very seriously and looking at we held a an art and tech Samet at Christie's London with international speakers about three months ago in which this was a hotly debated topic I think the only thing that we can the only thing with certainty that we predict is that the blockchain is a ledger based system and therefore we're in the art market Ledger's are important so recording ownership authenticity et cetera without a doubt something will happen the limitations with that though are that so much of what we will talk about are the historical art works that people are buying owning etc and to backdate will load up that level of information on to let any kind of ledger system is that you know I would just be a gigantic task I remember when art net started they were the first online company to publish publicly publish online the actual over auction records which is a standard best practice when they start when they launched in about 2000 2001 they only did records when they went back to 1995 so you're in and it's never really gotten any further back so I think the same limitations will happen with blockchain if that's what it's used for I'm sure artists might you know I'm sure someone I drew would have a better idea about artists creating something in blockchain that can then be immortalized a bit I think there's some investors who have already tried to create funds through blocked they have in their auction houses start a new startup auction houses I think people and blood to the blockchain as yeah I don't see how it works because you're right yeah oh that I think the blockchain is really good in in authentication but then there are so many artworks in the world and especially I mean from Oh master and China has been thousands of years how are we going to and even today even when you authenticate some some of the old artworks it's impossible but it's a very interesting concept and really something that people are keeping an eye on because it feels like intuitively there might be some possibility there with the crypto it is interesting for provenance and and I think yeah also will it will go really hand-in-hand with virtual reality works in terms of authentication elf indicating visa so that's definitely a trend that we've talked about I just wanted to say this we could just go on for hours I think yes we can go on for hours but we have to unfortunately end it here so I want to thank you all for coming Ben Elizabeth drew pearl for me such a dynamic and passionate argument about what you do and your roles and how the whole art world works together collaboratively I also want to thank the entire Milken Institute team for adding this new art and culture initiative to their insightful and extraordinary programming at the conference and thank you all for joining I hope you enjoyed a good time my name is Helen Lee Warren and see you next time [Applause]"
BrVDcWFp4yc,"India, China, and the Maritime Silk Road: More Than Just a Trade Route | Indian Ocean History","From ancient times to the medieval era, the Maritime Silk Road (also known as the Indian Ocean trade routes) has served as a trade superhighway connecting India, China, Southeast Asia, the Arab world, East Africa, and the Mediterranean.

The Maritime Silk Road is an icon of pre-modern globalization, and we can learn a great deal about the interconnectedness of the ancient and medieval world through examining the unique details of this network.  But it was more than just a trade route -- the Maritime Silk Road was traversed not only by merchants, but also diplomats, adventurers, monks, and others.

""Indianization"" from the Indian Point of View: Trade and Cultural Contacts with Southeast Asia in the Early First Millennium C.E. by Monica L. Smith",1,for thousands of years india and china have been connected by two trade networks the overland silk road and the lesser-known maritime silk road today our focus is going to be on the maritime silk road the maritime silk road serves as powerful evidence that historical asia was deeply interconnected but the maritime silk road wasn't just a trade network it was also used by missionizing buddhist monks and hindu brahmins by diplomats and adventurers simply put the routes were a part of a vast intra-continental exchange trade piracy diplomacy raids and cultural expansion perhaps unsurprisingly given their location indian ports served as the vital heart of this network linking together the asian continent from end to end let's dive into the eastern section of the maritime silk road the trade routes connecting india southeast asia and china the maritime silk road existed as early as the 2nd century bce but in the early days trade infrastructure was relatively undeveloped it was not until the 4th century ce nearly 600 years later that we begin to see the systemic large-scale exchange of goods ideas and peoples the dynamics of supply and demand remained relatively constant throughout much of the maritime silk roads history foreign merchants were frothing at the mouth to get a piece of china's enormous consumer market pie and to obtain quality manufactured goods after all china was prosperous and highly populated china would export a variety of items that were prized abroad silk and ceramics especially but also copper jade and silver meanwhile it would import large quantities of sandalwood black pepper and spices from india and southeast asia as for manufactured goods the chinese would routinely import glass from europe tin from southeast asia and textiles from india despite china's central importance in the maritime silk road trade for most of its history their native merchants were not directly involved in the shipping industry instead the routes were mostly plied by indian middle eastern and southeast asian merchant sailors from india trade was conducted throughout its coasts primarily in the southern regions the konkan malabar and coromandel coast but also on the utko coast along the areas known as kalinga and bengal interestingly the colloquial term for indian in southeast asia is killing which is a bastardization of the region of kalinga in any case trade flourished but ships weren't just carrying goods they were also carrying people people full of ideas and ready to proselytize southeast asia served as a key passage for goods going from india and further west towards china it's no surprise then that they would be exposed to ideas emanating from the indian subcontinent from at least the 3rd or 4th centuries ce southeast asian polities became increasingly indianized linguistically politically and religiously indian socio-political norms were imitated and hindu and buddhist thought came to dominate many popular myths dance forms and musical styles were wholesale imported from india who brought these cultural norms from india to southeast asia and why didn't southeast asian polities take on chinese culture and modes of thought instead there are a number of theories what we do know is that indian merchants many belonging to powerful south indian merchant guilds had established vibrant influential communities throughout southeast asia from coastal thailand to java for example an 8th century tamil inscription in southern thailand describes water tanks built by the merchant guild manigram for the benefit of their guild members and for residents of a nearby military camp the inscription further notes that the construction was requested by the tamil pallava king nandi varman iii side note speaking of the palave dynasty their linguistic script was exported to southeast asia in the 5th and 6th centuries and formed the basis for many southeast asian scripts including tai it's unlikely that the merchant class is solely responsible for transmitting indian culture to southeast asia modern historians tend to believe that some combination of hindu priests scholars and merchants all played a role many elements of indianization appear to have been taken up in a top-down fashion and are indicative of brahmanical influence the imposition of the caste system the spread of hindu religious and philosophical traditions among local elites the influence of hindu architecture and the establishment of hindu codes of law all point to the importance of brahmins and indianizing southeast asia but why didn't southeast asian kingdoms pick up chinese modalities instead china's systemic aggressions gave southeast asian kingdoms pause china routinely invaded northern vietnam korea and its other neighbors apprehension about chinese expansion led the rulers of southeast asia to prefer indian political and religious iconography choosing to take on indian norms was safe after all until the medieval choles no indian empire had attempted to invade or interfere with the autonomy of southeast asian kingdoms it's also worth noting that china was more insular in its world view at times it even prohibited chinese merchants from engaging in trade abroad these prohibitions prevented large-scale cultural exportation to southeast asia by contrast indian merchants who plied the trade and established themselves in southeast asian cities readily exported their culture to southeast asia they intermarried with natives and involved themselves in local affairs but india's cultural reach was not limited to southeast asia in the religious context it even exerted a level of cultural hegemony over east asia especially china there's some controversy as to how buddhism first arrived in china some historians believe that buddhism first arrived in china through the overland silk road in 68 ce some modern historians believe that buddhism actually made its way to southern china via the maritime silk road in 65 ce in any case but this thought was rapidly integrated into chinese society in the indian subcontinent remained a place of significant interest for chinese monks and scholars for nearly a thousand years buddhist monks with a particular sense of adventure academic curiosity and wanderlust departed from both sides of this exchange india and china to explore places foreign to them they taught journaled and translated books not all monks made use of the maritime route exclusively the chinese monk fashion for example entered north india through the overland silk road in the 5th century ce but left for his return trip to china through sri lanka and southeast asia other monks made extensive use of the resources available along the maritime silk road consider the chinese monk yi jing who lived in the 7th century yi jing was a lifelong admirer of fashion and inspired decided to travel all the way to india himself thanks to a gift from an unknown benefactor yi jing was able to depart for india through southeast asia he stopped in palumbon the capital of the sri vijaya empire and a centerpiece of maritime silk road trade he spent six months there studying sanskrit and malay from palumbon yijing departed for india and lived and studied in nalanda university for 11 years collecting a number of buddhist tree disease and artifacts he then returned to palumbon where he stayed for nearly a decade during this time he was helped by foreign monks in translating the texts that he had obtained in india he left only briefly for southern china to resupply on inks and paper of palambong yi jing wrote in the city buddhist priests number more than one thousand they investigate and study all the subjects that exist just as in india the rules and ceremonies are not at all different if a chinese priest wishes to go to the west in order to hear and read the original scriptures he'd better stay here one or two years and practice the proper rules indian buddhist monks also made fascinating journeys to china and the rest of east asia bodhidharma a tamil monk from the 5th century ce who traveled to china and founded zen buddhism according to legend he may have also contributed to shaolin kung fu bodhisana a tamil monk from the 8th century ce who traveled to china and japan he taught sanskrit and helped to ensure that buddhism would maintain a foothold in japan despite the objections of shinto conservatives subakarasinha an odiamonk from the 8th century ce who traveled to china and became politically influential favored by the tang emperor vajra bodhi a temu monk from the 8th century ce who traveled to china via palambang in china he became the head of the jianfu temple in the capital of changhan he was a politically influential monk who had ties to the imperial court and enjoyed the patronage of nobility amoga vajra half indian monk from the 8th century ce who is the disciple of vajrabadi he would later become one of the most politically powerful monks in the history of china obtaining a military governorship and having a massive influence on chinese politics and culture he made significant headway in temple projects designed to promote indian iconography in china and performed rights at the request of the tang emperor to avert natural and military disasters indian monks became so politically powerful in china that the tang government reacted and briefly expelled all foreign monks in the mid-8th century and all this is just scratching the surface commerce politics and cultural exchange along the maritime silk road was subject to many influences by the medieval era the maritime silk road kingdoms were truly globalized for example socio-political upheaval in india and china had ramifications for southeast asia from the late 8th century to the early 10th century the political situation in india and china had serious impacts on maritime silk road trade in india three major events are worth noting islamic invasion the tripartite struggle over north india and the disintegration of pallava rule in south india in china the tang dynasty had become increasingly weak it had lost several battles against expanding central asian powers and was embroiled in a string of domestic uprisings tang china reacted to political turmoil by turning inwards becoming xenophobic and making it difficult for foreign merchants to gain access to chinese markets the tang government officially severed many trade links causing a substantial decline in commerce indian and chinese trade disruptions were felt deeply southeast asian powers relied on the maritime silk road trade its disturbance led to fundamental changes the sri vijaya empire unraveled as local feudal lords began to compete with one another over the declining trade as srivijaya lost control over key ports in the straits pirates were able to operate more freely during this era pirates posed such a threat to sea commerce that goods were being transported over land across the isthmus of craw in a bid to avoid piracy but change was on the horizon by the late 10th century ce trade was booming along the maritime silk road once again in fact the routes were better trafficked and commerce was freer than it had ever been in the past what changed in india the tamil chola empire consolidated its rule over much of south india meanwhile the trade friendly fatimid dynasty established itself in egypt and the trade-friendly song dynasty took over southern china and its ports the song dynasties rule was a period of great commercial and industrial growth in china the changes that occurred during this period have been referred to as the medieval economic revolution population in the southern provinces of china exploded the period also saw expanded money supply the creation of bills of exchange new forms of credit and paper money in the adoption of foreigner friendly trade policies simply put the song dynasty made china into a golden goose to coordinate overseas trade and taxation the song dynasty established maritime trade supervisorates they also moved away from ritualized tribute missions and towards private trade enterprise this trade was often carried out by international merchant communities who set themselves up locally in chinese ports in guangzhou for example archaeologists have discovered the structure of a tamil temple indicative of the indian community that lived in the city and were involved in trade the large profits made by song china are attested to in the historical record the song dynasty benefited so greatly from expanding trade that they developed many new ports along the coast to accommodate the volume of commerce during the medieval era the maritime silk road also became a much preferable route to the overland silk road in the 1020s ce the overland silk road had become too dangerous to traverse the song dynasty officially warned diplomats and merchants against using said routes and encouraged people to use the maritime routes instead by the 1400s ce the expansion of the maritime trade led to a more active foreign policy towards indian powers chinese merchants were now actively involved in trade throughout southeast asia and india in fact chinese merchants established seasonal communities throughout south india court officials merchants and ships from china made recurrent trips to the coastal regions of india and contributed to the surge in maritime commerce for example in the 14th century the yuan dynasty sent officials to south india to convince small maritime kingdoms such as kolem and the madurai sultanate to submit to yuan overlordship these exchanges laid the foundations for the selection of the indian coast as a primary destination for the expeditions of ming admiral zhang hee admiral zhang he's fleet served the ming dynasty's political and economic ambitions the primary goal of zheng he's voyages was to exact tribute and to promote the flow of international goods to markets in china the ming were disinterested in military expeditions or direct colonialism in india instead they sought to extend their influence through diplomacy and soft power the nature and impact of this diplomacy can be highlighted through ming interference in kerala politics calicut and cochin were two rival kingdoms and were on the brink of war in the early 15th century in order to prevent a military confrontation the ming court granted special status to cochin and its ruler this was a smart bet cochin soon emerged as the more important seaport on the malabar coast and the chinese now enjoyed a heightened privilege it was also during this time that chinese merchants began to frequent ports along the coromandel coast and the bay of bengal the historical relationship between india china and southeast asia is deeply intertwined with the maritime silk road the shifting dynamics of commerce culture and politics gives us insight into the highly globalized world of medieval asia and now you know
saOEP_QOWjI,Vande Bharat Hitting Reset On Train Travel?,"NEW DELHI: Three years ago, India launched its first homegrown semi-high-speed train it connected New Delhi and Varanasi via Kanpur, Allahabad. Officially, it is called Vande Bharat. But at the Integral Coach Factor in Chennai, where the ambitious project to create a modern state-of-the-art train, it was christened Train-18—so that the staff working on the project remembered that the project had to be concluded in 18 months. Not only did they deliver on deadline, but the train has also been embraced by India. By the government as well as the people. Last year’s Union Budget promised to roll out 400 new Vande Bharat’s in 2025—six more are already operational. Clearly, Vande Bharat is poised to rewrite train travel in India. To understand why and more we spoke to Sudhanshu Mani, the former head of the Vande Bharat project.

the first make in India semi high speed train did you know for the first time at all women 29 member crew manufactured and assembled an entire coach of the Vande Bharat did you know that when they bought its original name was train 18 [Music] oh hello and welcome to another edition of capital calculus I am your host Anil padmanabin on 15 February 2019 the first one day Bharat Express was launched connecting Delhi and Varanasi indeed this was less than two years after the project had been kicked off its success is a story of audacity grit and determination at present eight trains are operational and the union government is committed that 400 will be functioning by 2025. indeed India's first High-Speed Rail Project is set to revolutionize transport in the country to understand why and more we spoke to sudhanshu money sudhanshu is a former head of the Vande Bharat project and I began by asking sudhanshu his first thoughts on the third anniversary of the Vande Bharat Express especially since it happened under his watch and in record time when I say we I mean I am the capable team at ICF we had most of them had this angst that India doesn't have a modern you know training Expedia higher technology metal Aesthetics and we all decided that we will work together to give this to the country uh and we were Fortune perhaps favors Ibrahim we were able to deliver it in record time and uh the agencies helped to test it in time as well known worthiness after October 18th it was tested and ready in January and finally launched as you say on 15th of February 2019 so at that stage of course we didn't realize that our product is going to be this popular and in today's context if you see what's happening it's a product which is going to change the face of Indian railways when I say I say that very responsibly 10 trains are already there uh a lot more could have been there but we'll not get into that the uh important thing is that well the next year the coming year may see as many and let's say 30 35 more and very soon that means in certainly in 2024 sometime you'll have 50 such trains crisscrossing across the country and that's why I say it's going to change the face of the uh Indian railways uh in the country and that gives us immense satisfaction uh without me having to go into the merits of the train and so on its popularity speaks for itself and the importance given to the train as a symbol of aspirational India by the Prime Minister himself that he is affording this much the respect for the train that he is going in and launching them each and every train himself and that's also perhaps the reason the the prime minister's interest in the train that we're going to have these uh 50 trains very soon so we never in our wildest imagination had thought that this would have such proliferation but it feels very good to see that indeed it has it has changed as I say in the face of Indian railways and many many more to come you heard the man when they Bharat will change the face of Indian railways but this required a fundamental mindset reset within the railways well that was very important uh not in respect of the train alone you see the organizationally Indian railways is yeah I regret to say but still it's changing but gradually still living in colonial times and uh there was so much funeral uh culturally and even structurally hierarchy wise so there's so much of uh barriers misplaced propriety Americans you know of protocol and things like that so that was something I was able to break in the beginning that I am convinced that more and more openness breakage of these protocols absolute platform for ideation from the lowest rung of workers uh whoa that can really transform a railway organization and be it a factory or a zone or anywhere else so that was a Bedrock on which many other things we were able to do in ICF the biggest visible change of course was the train itself but there's so many areas in integral ghost country that we could actually achieved only through this simple means of very strong mourning of employees among each other at every level and uh and uh some kind of a audacity a little wood spot to do something new for example uh ICM became the only Factory of Indian railways which is carbon negative consuming 12.5 megawatt from conventional power in generating 13 main Award of renewable energy through Windmill and solar power empowerment of women when women 29 of them is it 23-57 supervised by a lady officer making a coach entirely on their own that and heavy fabrication job it's not like a desk job or a computer or assembly job heavy fabrication job that was a strong signal to tell the world that respecting all women as equal is not a matter of lip service or a cliche it has to be demonstrated and these women were able to demonstrate it and and that for a for any organization really walking into 21st century is very essential was originally Crescent train 18. the story behind the name captures the audacity of this game changing project well so when swing on this sanctioned there were other doubts challenges which we are not getting into there was a large project one of the things that my team told me is a project of this magnitude starting with the concept making it to some kind of a design then a proper functional design engineering then to manufacture often the tooling validate test all this is the process which International armies than it should if you do it properly and systematically takes 36 to 42 months we are in April 17 you are retiring in December 18 giving us 21 months by the time you retire we will have completed the drawing work would manufacturer would perhaps not have started it'll be very easy for the next leader to come and say why are you purchasing this trouble I mean who asked you to make this train uh we were purchasing unnecessarily problem if it doesn't work who will reply all that kind of doubts you know and the project may get abandoned and then when we will be after an excitement of 21 months it can be such a damn Square that's when I said that yes you the old concerns are genuine I know how Railways and leaders work so now let's find a solution and a solution was I will try and do something which has not been done anywhere earlier and that is burner Midnight Oil Workers work timing suited to others whether in India or abroad and we will work like donkeys like Indians can and turn down this train before I retire that means in 2018 calendar year itself another reminder to everyone in the team that here is a train we are working on which is going out of integral Coach Factory in calendar year 2018. so let's call it train 18. I was curious to know as to what makes Vande Bharat so special so there is there's nothing level as such if you look at the world uh some people even call it an intervention I don't uh yes but there are many things which are novel from Indian railways number one is the coaches in a train get attached it has the locomotive gets attached it has brought from one end to another all that is made unnecessary because there is no locomotive the coaches are permanently coupled and all the equipment for driving the train for air conditioning for heating lighting whatever everything is under the board the space above the board is entirely available for passenger amenities except two cabs in the end so that's uh and then that's the media started calling it engineless train engine and common parlance is the locomotive so that name is stuck which is technically incorrect but still I mean USP is this that the train has no locomotive it has coaches of all same profile so the train is amenable for very uh uh aerodynamically uh sneak and elegant design which we think we were able to do it so it automatically becomes aesthetically very Superior apart from engineering performance because of aerodynamic profile it is not that government departments have not enjoyed success after all we have the extremely successful story of ISRO but the problem is that they are more the exception than the rule so the big question then is whether one day Bharat is that Tipping Point of course ISRO and of course Department of atomic energy drdo to some extent not entirely but definitely to some extent these are the examples of government agencies having delivered uh near world class products which all of us can be proud of um then they work in an environment of perhaps lower Interventional bureaucracy uh they work Under the Pier One and they also work under the uh uh an environment on denial of Technology which means they don't have the option to go to somebody else and Link for technology or purchased technology Railways have no such problem so the first instant if you know in a new type of locomotive or train why don't we import it that is also a reason why we didn't hit the railway Engineers does not Merchant uh otherwise the pool of Engineers engineering managers is very very competent and it's over the years that their in their technical competence and the technical excitement to do something starts getting killed because they are not engaged to do something out of the box of the country but it it's there for to be tapped uh and I realized that and my team members realized that all we did was to channelize that energy towards uh delivering this train uh we never thought that we were doing attempting something impossible we knew it was difficult we had to give 110 of what we were capable of but that hundred and ten percent you know comes out of Pride and ownership you heard sudhanshu India's world-class Personnel both within and outside government however they need an enabling environment and that is the most compelling aspect of the train 18 story thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe to Stratus Global on YouTube hit the Bell icon so that you don't miss any updates and please do share any thoughts and ideas with us I am available on Twitter at Capital calculus I'll be back next week with another episode till then stay safe foreign [Music]
zbpFfMzjtJA,"All-Weather, Faster Connectivity To LAC: India Gets Going","NEW DELHI: Earlier this week, the Union Cabinet approved the construction of a tunnel which would provide year-round connectivity to areas close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The 4.1-km-long tunnel at Shinku La on the Nimu-Padum-Darcha road axis will cost nearly ₹1700 crore and is expected to be completed by December 2025. Once that happens, it will enable faster movement of troops and supplies to the frontlines. In this episode of ‘Simply Nitin’, StratNews Global Editor-in-Chief Nitin A. Gokhale has more about how India is sprucing up its border infrastructure to counter any Chinese misadventure.

To get instant updates join our telegram circle - https://t.me/stratnewsglobalbroadcast",1,strategic Affairs subscribe to our YouTube channel click the Bell icon for updates hello and welcome to stat News global this week the simply nitin program that I do every Saturday is coming to you live and the discussion this week or the program or information that I'm going to provide and try and have some more focus on this subject this week is going to be India's progress or India's plans to progress the Border Villages and the Border areas through Rapid buildup of infrastructure along the northern borders with China that's the topic of this week's simply within I am nitin Goku no no no no no no no no no [Music] so earlier this week in fact on Wednesday India's cabinet committee on security approved a budget of nearly 1700 crore rupees for construction of a tunnel along the Third Road access between Himachal Pradesh and ladakh now if you look at the road that I'm talking about this road is called the darsha padam uh nimu Lay Road now this will be built on this road this proposed tunnel is going to come up at cincoon La or cincoon pass at the at an altitude of about 16 580 feet it has been given about three years to complete that is from January this year uh when the first proposal was put up for consideration and was passed by the cabinet committee on security uh this Wednesday as I said it will take three years to complete the length of the tunnel is 4.1 kilometers and of course it will be built by the border roads organization our savior in the Northern areas and and the Border areas now why is it that I am focusing on this particular tunnel there is a history to it the two roads that connect ladakh to rest of the country come from two directions one is of course the Srinagar lay Highway the old Srinagar and the second one in the green here uh is the uh atal tunnel of the rothang pass darsha baralashlaw and then finally going to lay via this is the old road which is used by the Indian army and the ladakis to connect to rest of India now this road is prone to landslides it is a very tough terrain and there are more than three uh big uh passes there these law in Tibetan or in that area's language is a pass and these passes are about 15 000 feet each of them these three big passes and there are several small passes what happens is from November onwards or December onwards every year the snow is so heavy in these passes that the road closed down closes down for traffic which means India is then left with only the Srinagar kargil nimuli Highway and which makes it vulnerable because even there there is a zozila pass uh between Srinagar and kargil which also closes down for at least three months and that creates a problem so therefore uh the Border roads organization and the government came up with this third axis called highway road which was in the planning stage for a number of years before it was opened to traffic in 2020 single Lane traffic of course small vehicles and this is the road on which I happen to travel to lay in October 2020 from Manali so I first crossed the rohtang pass then got on to darcha and then we came to a place called zincunla where you can see this footage from October 2020. uh this is where the tunnel the proposed tunnel which was approved early this week was approved by the Cabinet Government security is going to come out now what is the importance of this tunnel the importance of this tunnel is that once it comes up once it is open to traffic the rest of the road is easy to Traverse compared to the old Manali lay highway or the Srinagar lay Highway during winter and therefore the Indian army which is now heavily deployed in ladakh along Eastern ladakh line of actual control with China and which requires much more supplies and needs rotation of troops more frequently than ever before can use this road all year round now that is a huge strategic boost to India's deployment and India's security because so far because of lack of Road access for nearly three months on the Srinagar lay Highway and for six months between the Old manalilei Highway the Indian army had to Airlift a lot of troops are rotating the troops through the air Bridge which the strategic and medium airlift capabilities of the Indian Air Forces allowed them to do but there is no substitute for a surface transport movement of large number of troops and therefore this is becomes important uh there's a history to this of course the simkula area also gets snowbound and once this tunnel comes up with a 4.1 kilometer tunnel then the road remains operational throughout the year this had to be planned at the highest level the northern command had been pushing for it for some time but it took intervention at the level of the National Security advisor who was then uh sort of given a presentation or given the idea of the importance of tunnel and it has still taken three years for the government to come up with the feasibility report and then finally approve uh the budget tunnel is going to be something that is going to be a game changer it will be watched by India's adversary China and apart from all the other tunnels that are coming up along the northern borders and the roads that we have been speaking about repeatedly on statins Global in fact a month ago you'll remember I spoke about how a new frontier Highway in arunachal Pradesh has also been sanctioned from east to west between tawang and walang that is coming up this is the seller pass which is between tejpur and tawang which is under construction and should be operational sometime this year again giving all weather connectivity to the modern areas of arunachal Pradesh Western arunachal Pradesh and again giving Indian army the option to induct more troops or rotate more troops as and when it requires in that sector so clearly the emphasis by the government is now to improve the connectivity improve roads build more roads build more strategic roads and later in the next stage also start building strategic railway lines which we can do a separate program I'm sure in coming weeks or months but I wanted to emphasize on this because if you look at the old uh problems that India faced in inducting troops into ladakh or getting supplies to ladakh not just to the Indian army or the Indian Air Force but also to the itbp which is now become the the first line of defense on the line of actual control uh with the government's actioning eight more battalions the idbp is also going to play a major role in being the Border guarding force not an offensive Force like the Army but a border guarding force and also the civilians living in the union territory of ladakh will benefit once the road between lay and rothang or gray and Manali remains operational throughout the year it will change their lifestyle it will change the economy of ladakh and that is why they say when you build roads you build an entire economy around these roads as it happened in the 20th century America it is now slowly happening in Border areas of the northern borders of northern states in India apart from the roads and infrastructure the government has also come up with vibrant Villages program uh which focuses on ensuring that population sparse population along the border with China on the Indian side does not leave these Villages they remain there they get their livelihoods there this is the Kaho Village in eastern arunachal Pradesh in the wrong sector where I happen to have a visit which I happen to have visited in again October 2020. this is the first couple of that village where 73 people live and this is across just behind them is the uh is the Tibetan side the indoor Tibet border uh sort of touches this Village and this Village is now this is one of the several Villages that are now going to get attention from the government along with that cincolla pass approval this Wednesday the government has approved a plan for nearly 4 000 crore Rupees to develop these what they call vibrant Villages program which will be spread over several Villages across four states starting from arunachal Pradesh in the east then Sikkim Himachal Pradesh and uttarakhand all Villages along the border and of course this is one urine territory so four states and one Union territory Villages along the northern border along with the Tibet or indoor Tibet border will get priority in getting many new facilities Health Centers uh you know the drinking water facilities dedicated electricity schools skill development programs you'll get uh self-help groups will be created in these Villages so that people earn their livelihood within the village or near the village and not migrate out to bigger towns and bigger cities which will then empty out these Villages which will create problems of its own uh in the Border area so the government is now concentrating on making sure that the villagers are not forced out of their Villages because of lack of connectivity or lack of facilities and out of this 4 000 crore rupees which have been allocated to the vibrant Villages program 2500 crore rupees would be spent on building internal Roads connecting the main arterial highways which the Border roads organization is already building in all these four states in one Union territory uh making sure that roads will give what uh boosts that they require so these bridges that you see in the remote areas this is the this is the footage which is taken from the helicopter uh in different valleys of arunachal Pradesh when we had gone there in October 2020 and uh you can see many uh roads being constructed in these remote and difficult terrain uh in arachal Pradesh in ladakh where the working season is less than six months and in rajal Pradesh of course the rainy season takes away uh any window of opportunity for building roads they get washed away they get buried under the landslides but now with new techniques and new equipment that has come in new modern equipment mechanized process for building roads and tunnels this is becoming more and more easier and as you can see the Border roads is working day and night in very tough conditions these are the front line workers they are as much as important as important soldiers as the combat soldiers because they work in remote areas with very little facility but make sure that these roads come up these tunnels come up the connectivity improves and then it sort of helps everyone from civilian population to the administration to the military and to the uh Central armed police forces like the itbp and in some cases BSF in the rest of the country where these roads and bridges and tunnels and infrastructure uh is being built so clearly over the past 10 years and especially in the last seven eight years there is intense focus on infrastructure building you've heard me doing programs on specific sectors like arunachal Pradesh where I spoke about the frontier Highway one month ago how connecting west to east arunachal Pradesh along the McMahon line is going to be a game changer for the villagers for the sparse population uh staying in arunachal Pradesh different districts and also how it will act as a deterrent against China whose uh the bla whose Army the people's Liberation Army is trying to be aggressive it's trying to be belligerent along different pressure points the magma online or the line of actual control across the border that India demand border which has remained contentious which has remained disputed which has remained unresolved and because now India realizes more and more because of Chinese actions that this is the area where India needs to concentrate on the Continental challenge that is coming from China apart from whatever is happening in the Indian Ocean and along the maritime domain where China is trying to come increasingly into into the Indian Ocean which we can talk about in a different program but what I wanted to draw your attention to was basically uh when these projects are sanctioned they are done with a purpose they are not just for making up numbers or spending money yes the money is now being spent on focused programs focused projects which give benefits Beyond uh and above uh whatever is being spent because uh this kind of uh infrastructure projects are long lasting there this is near the rothan tunnel which you know is now being renamed as which came up after 20 years of work and most of it in the past five or six years so clearly the government has risen to the challenge and this will only help uh strengthening India's defenses along the um the India Tibet border and of course then give a base for India to launch any kind of offensive operation when required if required that is something that we have to keep in mind now of anybody who's interested in visiting ladakh or anything anybody who is interested in visiting arunachal Pradesh must try and go by these roads use these roads it's not only an adventure but is also an education to understand how people in these areas live how difficult their lives have been for such a long time but because of focused attention that they are getting now from the government they will be in a better position to enjoy their life and in fact develop in their uh their own livelihoods and enjoy the benefit of being citizens of in India that is on the March that's all I have this week I wanted to flag this uh do visit Strat News global social media handles subscribe to them if you haven't already done and if you have done do keep spreading the word to your friends families and acquaintances and of course send us feedback and some ideas which you can take up every week in this program which I do either live once in a while or a recorded program called simply anything which tries to bring you tries to focus uh attention on issues that matter issues that are important for the nation's security also making sure that more and more people understand how there is a focused uh attempt to make sure that the Indian military the Indian population along the border areas get the uh the facilities that they deserve that's all I have as I said for the time being it's goodbye and good night foreign foreign
L8suzjPlvYk,Gilgit-Baltistan to join India this year? Pak gets a deadline from PoJK activists | IN FOCUS,"POJK activist Amjaz Ayub Mirza has revealed that the pro-freedom groups in Gilgit-Baltistan have issued a deadline to Pakistan to withdraw its troops from the occupied region of erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir by the end of this year. He claimed that the people of the region want to join India and adopt the Indian constitution. Mirza is living in exile in London and spoke to Hindustan Times Digital Videos Editor, Aditi Prasad. Watch. 

#pakistan #pakistanoccupiedkashmir #gilgitbaltistan #pojk #india #narendramodi #pakistan #shehbazsharif #pakarmy 

Hindustan Times Videos bring you news, views and explainers about current issues in India and across the globe. We’re always excited to report the news as quickly as possible, use new technological tools to reach you better and tell stories with a 360 degree view to give you a better understanding of the world around you.",1,let's talk about gilgit Pakistan because very very close to your heart you also come from that region how is the situation there because this economic crisis what we hear is that the annual Financial development grant for gilgit baltistan from the federal government even that has not been released yes uh the development funds uh for the past two years have not been released and uh for last year the last physical year and this physical year the development budget for Pakistani occupied Jammu Kashmir has not been released either now the situation current situation in Pakistani occupied is that according to their own local government sources they have the chief minister of Pakistan has said that we have only got five days of flower left five days of supply of flower left uh that was issued yesterday so today it means that only four days of supplies are left Pakistan is Pakistan is forcing uh the government of Pakistan to increase the prices of a bag of flour from 1300 rupees a bag suddenly to 3 000 rupees a bag and that has been that has been a major uh cause for conflict between the federal government and the gilgit Pakistan government because the gilgal Pakistan government has refused they said that if we increase the bank price of a back straight from 1300 Rupees to three thousand rupees people are going to die of starvation we can't just can't do that that this is uh only one aspect of it so the capital of the whole region is gilgit but the capital of baltistan uh sub Capital you can call it is and I was reporting that uh 22 20 hours load shedding every day was taking place in Chicago alone which is a trade hub for about this car it increased to 23 22 hours a day day before yesterday the Traders told me that now the load shedding has increased to more than 23 hours a day out of 24 hours a day 20 more than 23 hours a day there's no shedding there are no customers on in the bazaars and people cannot buy the because they don't have enough money and the Traders uh many many like hundreds of businesses have gone bankrupt shutdown closes and unemployment has raised because there is no electricity so the small workshops have shut down which means that the daily wages in thousands are unemployed people are committing suicides people are you know in a very dire situation right now so tell me uh you know I want to talk about uh China because China the cpec corridor you know Pakistan had invited China there the CPAC Corridor cuts through gilgit Pakistan uh the Hope from both sides uh I mean of course China came because it was to strengthen its presence in the in the entire region especially the indo-pacific but for Pakistan it was a way for it to tighten its grip over Pakistan over which is which is Shia dominated now tell me uh when this project was initiated there was a lot of Hope now given the present crisis what is the status of that project and I mean is it is because there is a lot of local Uprising against this project and that has been going on for quite some time but I want to talk about the situation now after this economic crisis has gripped this region are the Chinese still there the Chinese are still there but in fewer numbers and lesser numbers and I give you a small example of how CPAP is affecting us on an ecological level you know we have this since Rivera sin we call it and now the government has diverted the river sin through a diversional tunnel to provide for uh the dasu dam which is a hydropower electric project of China and Pakistan main shareholders obviously China in it because they are investing the money there and this diversion of river is not something new to us they are diverted the rivers Neelam and Jailer which is kashin ganga and jelum in Pakistani occupy Jammu Kashmir to supply water for the hydropower projects now these hydropower projects are uh to facilitate the electricity consumption of Punjab in Pakistan not for us in gilgen Balto pojk so there there's a resentment there the other trick that they have done is the dam is uh like in uh but the power generating system they have fit in kpk which is adjusting it's a border so so that all the revenue goes into the Pakistani coffers now this kind of mean and low lowly you know uh manipulation of our natural resources is more than obvious has been destroyed because of the Neelam and jelum rivers diversion and now is going to suffer the same fate and CPAC projects are have come to basically have come to a hall because if you remember many months ago there were nine Chinese the engineers who were killed in a road accident that allegedly was a terrorist incident against the Chinese and the Chinese not only but even in Balochistan it has come to a hall since 2017. it has gradually come to a standstill now you know given the situation especially in balochist especially in Pakistan occupied Kashmir um you know is there any role that you think India can play because you we know I mean Pakistan has obviously refused any help from India as well as its its crisis is concerned what is your message or what would be your suggestion to Prime Minister Modi well my suggestion to Prime Minister Modi would be number one to make sure that in the next elections the seats from Pakistani occupy that are in the Jammu Kashmir assembly or the loks about the Raja Sabha at least they should be if you can't fill them at least have some representation in them of the local people of these occupied territories number one number two to help us and facilitate us to launch a global campaign uh against the fast Narrative of Pakistan because many countries especially the 56 Muslim countries they still believe that India as we offer Bayern and Pakistan is a liberator whereas it's all upside down is that fact of the matter is that Pakistan is an occupied Pakistan attacked the previously state of Jammu Kashmir on 22nd of October 1947 and the Maharaja Hari Singh the king of Jammu Kashmir he signed an instrument of accession similar to the other instruments of accession that was signed by 500 and odd previously States it's the same document so we and what is happening in our states uh like occupied region pojk pogb we should be able to uh you know explain that to The Wider World Community because the gross human rights violations economic right violations political right violations are taking place there and the world doesn't know because there's a media blackout even the pakistanis don't know in Pakistan uh what is going on over there because there are check posts and you have to have a reason to to visit Jammu Kashmir and in the occupied territories number three uh and finally number three I think that it is time for the Indian people that in every single state and union territory of India uh the journal public human rights activists political rights activists I'm not talking about political parties I'm talking about those campaign groups they should form a PO JK GB solidarity campaign groups so that on local level they can bring awareness to the Indian people who most of them don't know what's going on in pojp so this will prepare a ground for us because we are given a deadline of 22nd of October 2023 for Pakistan to withdraw our troops right so we are heading very close now this deadline was given three years ago now this is the year so we want the public opinion Indian public opinion to back us to support us you know to be to stand not behind us but with us on this issue yeah how and and and I'm sure I'm sure uh your your uh uh voices will reach the right uh uh you know authorities and uh that will happen but um what do you hope to gain out of it at the end of it all out of what out of once Pakistan which suppose you've given a deadline for 2023 you say Pakistan withdraws its forces from there then what what next word what what next for pojk for uh well the next immediate step would be that we are going to form a government over there and from day one we are going to uh uh we are going to adopt the Indian constitution and we are going to enter into negotiations with the Indian government for the reunification of the uh of Jammu Kashmir

9ni0rI7wN18,SNG Explains: What Is South China Sea Dispute?,"The South China Sea is the epicenter of the dispute between China and its neighbouring countries like Taiwan, Vietnam,  The Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. This 1.4 million square miles long stretch has disputed islands such as Paracel, the Spratly, the Pratas, Scarborough Shoal, and Macclesfield Bank. This contention in the South China Sea dates back to the 20th century when China came out with its own 11-line map. Naturally rich and one of the busiest sea routes, the South China Sea holds a significant position in global politics.

7du9cNhSFgc,"UK, Italy and South Korea to work together for CVX future aircraft carrier for South Korean Navy","A new design for CVX, South Korea’s light aircraft carrier program, was revealed by Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) at MADEX 2021. The new design is significantly different from both HHI’s own previous design and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME)’s current design.

The new HHI proposal also has a ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp over the bow for STOVL operations.

The ship features twin islands and two aircraft elevators on either side of the flight deck. The first island will be in charge of overall operations, while the second island will carry out flight control duties. Moreover, the X-shaped design of the new islands provide unique advantages according to the representative.

The ship bears a striking resemblance to the Royal Navy’s new carriers, built half a world away, but there are some major distinctions between the two ships.

The arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth in South Korea later this year could be considered a marketing opportunity for British companies to wedge their feet in the door of this programme.

HHI says its carrier design would be 850 feet long, have a 200-foot-wide beam, and have a fully loaded displacement of around 45,000 tons. By comparison, the Queen Elizabeth class is 920 feet long, has a beam of 240 feet, and a displacement of 65,000 tons.

jump takeoff ramp over the bow for stovl operations the company has also been pitching a bow ramp on its carrier for some years now but this new model clearly represents a significantly evolved design the ship features twin islands and two aircraft elevators on either side of the flight deck the first island will be in charge of overall operations while the second island will carry out flight control duties moreover the x-shaped design of the new islands provide unique advantages according to the representative the ship bears a striking resemblance to the royal navy's new carriers built

comparison the queen elizabeth class is 920 feet long has a beam of 240 feet and a displacement of 65 000 tons the hyundai model is displayed with f-35bs ah-1z cobra attack helicopters of which a potential transfer to korea has been approved plus h-60 series helicopters arranged on deck as well as what looks like a leonardo merlin helicopter a type not currently used by south korea hyundai says that it will be able to operate up to around 20 f-35bs [Music] there's also an auxiliary deck area at the very rear of the ship for operating small rotary wing drones and an adapted weld deck from which to deploy unmanned surface vehicles usbs and unmanned underwater vehicles [Music] uuvs the hyundai carrier design has two elevators one on each side including one between the islands to move aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar however the hyundai design is not the only south korean carrier proposal on show it made x the south korean navy formerly known as the republic of korea navy itself displayed a model at maydex with much in common with the dsme proposal meanwhile a rival design from deus shipbuilding and marine engineering dsme is on display that also utilizes a twin island arrangement but lacks that ski jump instead having a flight deck that has more in common with u.s navy amphibious assault ships the vessel would be 860 feet long 150 feet wide and would have a displacement of around 45 000 tons according to that company dsme also says its carrier would be able to embark 16 f-35bs and six medium helicopters simultaneously with hangar space for 12 of the jet fighters it has two elevators on the starboard side to move those aircraft between decks in the course of maydex dsme signed a memorandum of understanding with italian shipbuilder fincantieri which would provide the korean firm with technological expertise derived from its own trieste class design a landing helicopter dock with f35b capability that's now being built for the italian navy and which also features twin islands the dsme vessel is closer in concept to the kinds of evolved amphibious assault ship designs that had been expected including older lpx 2 concept art nevertheless it still represents a considerably larger and more capable ship than the south korean navy's current doctor class landing platform helicopter lph which is 652 feet long 101 feet wide and has a displacement of only 19 500 tons in the past it's been reported that the cvx whichever design is chosen will be equipped with an active electronically scanned array aesa radar of the same type that will be used in the new kddx destroyer it is expected to be protected by haging ksam surface to air missiles and close in weapon systems ciws the latter is expected to be an indigenous design developed under the ciws2 program there's also evidence that soul is mulling another possible carrier design at the other end of the scale which would provide the option to move from stovl operations to short takeoff but arrested recovery s-t-o-b-a-r combining an angled deck ski jump take-off ramp and arrester gear this is the same configuration currently used by china india and russia on their in-service carriers this would permit non-stovl aircraft to be embarked perhaps including a carrier version of the indigenous kf-21 new generation fighter for some years now south korea has been planning to introduce an aircraft carrier capability to the rokn and last year the service formally confirmed that it would introduce a vessel capable of embarking fixed-wing jets earlier this year the project received the name cvx in past there has even been discussion of small or medium carriers equipped for catapult launch although this equipment seemed to be absent from the proposals it made x suggesting that that rokn has settled on a carrier that is stovl capable larger than the dokdo class lph but not as ambitious as the kinds of catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery c-a-t-o-b-a-r warships currently on in service with france and the united states and under development in china nevertheless the korean cvx proposals are still smaller than the two that china already operates while beijing's third carrier is set to be bigger still with considerable naval development in the last two decades a true aircraft carrier as opposed to an aviation capable amphibious assault ship would be the next logical step and would be a significant symbol of seoul's maritime power helping it keep pace to some degree with regional rivals china and japan a carrier would also provide the centerpiece of a naval battle group also including destroyers frigates and submarines all of which are produced domestically however the utility of a stovl carrier depends on seoul's acquisition of f-35bs in addition to the conventional take-off and landing f-35ers 40 of which are on order for the republic of korea air force rokaf the air force had hoped to secure funds for 20 more f-35ers but it's possible that these could be swapped for f-35bs or a follow-on order could comprise both variants so far however no order has been placed the adoption of the f-35b would also provide the opportunity for closer cooperation with the u.s marine corps which has already deployed its own examples of the jet to the asia-pacific region aboard amphibious assault ships and has f-35bs permanently stationed at marine corps air station iwakuni in japan potentially marine corps jets could be used to increase the numbers of deployed jets aboard the cvx in the same way that they have been embedded within the carrier strike group for hms queen elizabeth meanwhile aircraft and units from the rokaf already frequently exercise with their counterparts from the u.s marine corps and other u.s services [Music] [Music] you
58FB3orQz8E,Nothing Can Kill the Arleigh Burke-class Destroyer,"The Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyers (DDGs) is a United States Navy class of destroyer built around the Aegis Combat System and the AN/SPY radar. The class is named for Admiral Arleigh Burke, an American destroyer officer in World War II, and later Chief of Naval Operations. The lead ship, USS Arleigh Burke, was commissioned during Admiral Burke's lifetime. 

These warships were designed as multimission destroyers, able to fulfill the strategic land strike role with Tomahawk missiles; antiaircraft warfare  role with powerful Aegis radar and surface-to-air missiles; antisubmarine warfare with towed sonar array, anti-submarine rockets, and ASW helicopter; and antisurface warfare with Harpoon missile launcher.

Thank You",1,the arleigh burke class ddg 51 guided missile destroyer is the most capable surface ship in the u.s navy and is the workhorse of the fleet today 62 of them roam the oceans giving meaning to american command of the seas and to the multi-decade pax americana that operates so seamlessly we mostly take it for granted these ships are the go-to capability when it comes to showing the flag and asserting u.s rights under international law just last month the uss russell ddg 59 and arleigh burke destroyer conducted a freedom of navigation operation in the south china sea the united states has conducted similar operations with arleigh burks in the black sea using the opportunity to signal american commitment to the north atlantic treaty organization alliance with its powerful suite of offensive and defensive weapons systems the arleigh burke is a true multi-mission ship capable of performing anti-submarine air defense missile defense and land sea attack missions the arleigh burke is the best air and missile defense ship in the world its powerful a-n-spy radar allows it to track both air and missile targets the aegis combat system allows these ships to engage multiple targets simultaneously the newest arleigh burke variants have the excellent spy 6 anti-air and anti-missile radar on board the aegis combat system will then choose the right weapon from its inventory of standard missiles this inventory includes the new sm-6 capable of engaging fixed-wing aircraft helicopters cruise missiles and some ballistic missiles and the sm-3 which is designed to engage longer-range ballistic missiles the next defensive system to be deployed on the ddg-51 will be a laser offensively the arleigh burke also packs a powerful punch it carries the tomahawk long-range land attack cruise missile including the newest block 5. this version has extended range enhanced navigation and communication systems and an improved data link the block 5 will be deployed in both a maritime strike version able to target moving ships and a hard target kill variant that can destroy land structures such as hardened command posts along with the tomahawk many ddg-51s carry a mix of harpoon missiles torpedoes and anti-submarine rockets the more modern variants also operate two mh-60r helicopters that can handle both submarines and surface targets u.s policy and strategy has adopted an enhanced focus on military competition with china in the west pacific region a large fleet of surface combatants is required to implement this strategy along with aircraft carriers and submarines meanwhile navy force planning in the american political system are converging on accelerating acquisition of a new class of frigate the constellation and quickly designing a new larger ship called the large surface combatant this is anticipated to be a replacement for the arleigh burke and possibly also the ticonderoga-class cruisers the navy is also looking at producing new smaller amphibious ships for the marines and possibly a light carrier because of the desire to move to a large new surface combatant construction of burke's destroyers is expected to taper off but a new ship program is an expensive effort it will take at least a decade to design an entirely new combatant and begin construction all defense acquisitions are difficult but getting a new class of warship into production is especially challenging the u.s navy has had significant challenges with new surface combatant designs in the last 20 years the ddg-1000 zumwalt-class destroyer a truly magnificent and revolutionary warship was so whiplashed by mission uncertainty new technology integration and design change orders but a planned acquisition of 32 ships ultimately produced three the littoral combat ship has been judged as not up to the needs of the blue water navy as its original mission is a counter-terror coastal platform has receded recently engine problems caused the navy to refuse to accept any additional freedom-class rhetorical combat ships it's worth remembering that the navy terminated the rla burke program to devote those resources to production of the ddg-1000 from 2006 to 2009 it did not acquire any ddg-51s when the decision was made to truncate the zumwalt class the navy had to restart the arleigh burke production line the additional costs associated with the production restart were significant it might make sense to keep building the ddg 51 and upgrade and modernize her successful holes for specific and additional missions the u.s shipbuilding industrial base knows how to build the arleigh burke there are two hot production lines one in maine one in mississippi keeping this building program going will maintain and even grow the fleet size quickly and at a known cost the navy should proceed carefully with its two new surface warships the new frigate and large surface combatant it is important to make sure the navy does not inadvertently shrink the fleet size if either the larger vessel or the new frigate or both get into design mission technical or political trouble the arleigh burke destroyer is still on the water today and has solid congressional support a multi-year budget plan that saves money and a proven combat record the next planned ddg 51 multi-year contract in fiscal year 2023 could extend or even increase this block by this will give the navy time to perfect new surface combatant planning without risking the combat power of the current fleet so [Music] so uh [Applause] [Music] you
y_PrH1bUaBs,Another Pohang Class Corvette is coming to the Philippines! Three to give?,"The Philippine Navy (PN) is reportedly planning to procure two additional Pohang-class corvettes from the Republic of Korea Navy.

The proposed acquisition of the vessels will add to the recent procurement of an ex-Korean Navy Pohang-class corvette.

PN acting spokesperson Captain Henry Quinto was quoted by the Philippine News Agency (PNA) as saying: “Yes, the PN is looking and hoping for two more Pohang vessels to ensure that we have at least three ships in its class and it was clear in a message delivered by flag-officer-in-command vice-admiral Robert Empedrad and the secretary of national defense Delfin Lorenzana himself.”",1,[Applause] foreign [Music] will be the second ship that the Philippines Navy possesses after the first acquisition of another retired pohang class Corvette Rox chungju which was renamed as BRP conrado Yap by Filipinos a total of 24 ships of this class were built and commissioned by the Republic of Korea Navy broken in four batches between 1984 and 1993. of these 10 are still in service with the rokin while several others have been transferred to countries including Egypt Peru Vietnam and Colombia the Philippine Navy PN appears to be moving ahead with plans to acquire another retired South Korean pohang class Corvette The Vessel under consideration as X rocks and Dom xpcc 771 which was withdrawn from broken service in December 2020. after two years of operation at Sea the Philippines Navy evaluated that the Korean Patrol Corvette is apt to be able to defend 7107 islands and has the best conditions for Coastal Patrol and defense The Rock Navy has transferred 40 ships to 10 friendly countries so far have been used as a means of facilitating defense cooperation and exports abroad with countries that received Korean vessels it was designed to patrol coastal areas equipped with 76 millimeters and 40 meters guns Mistral Harpoon lightweight Torpedoes and anti-submarine bombs its full displacement is 1 200 tons with 100 Crews the length of 88.3 meters width of 10 meters maximum speed of 32 knots rocks andong proved its operational performance by being chosen as the best Gunnery ship in 2016 2018 and even in 2020 the year of its decommissioning from The Rock Navy Fleet

Japan's flight of F-15 fighter jets to the Philippines is apparently aimed at strengthening military cooperation between the two countries so that Japan can expand its military presence in the South China Sea but Japan is gradually handing over its retired F-15 fighter jets to the Philippines song jongping a Chinese military expert and TV commentator told the global times on Wednesday if the defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines involves infrastructure such as technological transformation and Improvement of air bases and airfields then the deployment of Japanese military forces can be seen more clearly but in any case Japan's efforts will add more insecurity and instability in the South China Sea way noted way explained that the U.S plays a big role in the defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines and hopes to bring together its allies in the asia-pacific region including Japan and Australia for joint military operations the U.S also hopes that Japan can find a foothold around the South China Sea to rest and resupply so as to better assist the U.S military to carry out various military operations [Music]
2XYZpCqJf3A,Upgraded Philippine Navy: The Jose Rizal-class Corvettes and Their Role in Maritime Defens,"The Philippine Navy has two new corvettes that are currently being built. These ships, known as the Jose Rizal-class frigates, are being constructed by South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries. They are designed to have a maximum speed of 25 knots and a range of 4,500 nautical miles. The ships will be equipped with anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, and a 76mm main gun. These new corvettes will significantly enhance the Navy's capabilities and improve their ability to defend the country's territorial waters. However, the final strength of the corvette will depend on the effectiveness of the equipment, crew and the operational capabilities of the navy.

so like you know what why not let's check it out so anyways let's get into the video man let's go [Music] all right let's see this [Music] [Music] Hi Honda [Music] [Music] heavy industries of South Korea as a strong prisons here at Euro Naval 2022 to find out more I am with KS who senior vice president in charge of marketing for the export of special ships KS good morning thanks for welcoming us so can you please briefly introduce the systems on display on your boat yeah yeah first of all I'd like to thank you so much for giving me the time to introduce our company here you know we are Honda heavy industry yeah number one shipbuilder in the world delivering the commercials and the neighbors so they're a different brand from the Cars very happy in the Euro 2022 to promote our companies and ourselves to the to to the variety of the of the client here so we have built more than 80 neighborships for the Korean Navy but recently we had set up the new marketing plan to deliver to export the neighborship to to not only for the for the Korean Navy but also for the foreign navies as well we our management are very much in you're very much serious and interested to expand our business area outside of Korea so we'll do our best to take the order from the from the foreign navies yeah all right KS you introduced briefly the hhi booth at your enable but can you please tell us more about the programs ongoing uh for the Philippine Navy yeah yeah so this is the OPB for the Philippine navies this is the 95 meters long and the 40 meters wide basically this has the yeah main guns and the two delayed and the ciws and the hangar yeah under the under the Harley deck there's a there is a space for the mission module so if the Philippine neighbors wants to to operate other other missions then they they can they can put their mission modules in there that's cool when are you expecting to deliver the first opv to the Philippines yeah the delivery for the first opv is going to be the 2025 restaurant oh that's pretty soon just two years but by six months and at the on the on the other hand we got all the uh two Corvette that this vessel has a lot of capability as well like you see this vessel has a manual 60 76 millimeters they are amazing that's a big gun three the lasers and the anti air missiles and the ciws and the vertical launching system this is the first year a vertical launching system Philippine naves have got when will you deliver the first vessel we are the design state ment okay 20 25. okay and the second one is going to be the change that's pretty early still we do hope that we can deliver this to covet on time and make make our client Philippine navies we are satisfied so they're pretty much ready to build in it it's coming together ready cutting for the two brand new Corvettes which is expected to augment the Philippine Navy's PN 2 Jose Rizal class missile frigates now in service is expected to take place in May and November this year the steel cutting officially marks the start of the construction of any ship the steel cutting is expected to proceed in these months as South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai heavy Industries hhi is now in the process of finalizing the critical design review CDR for the two Corvettes last year the hhi completed its preliminary design review which was first subjected to a technical inspection and acceptance committee tiac before it proceeded with the CDR the same will be done with the CDR once it is completed the steel cutting will begin once the CDR is reviewed and approved by the tiac the Philippine Navy is expecting the delivery of two new Corvettes acquired under its Corvette acquisition project under the revised AFP modernization program's Horizon 2 phase covering years 2018-2022 the Philippines Department of National Defense DND signed a contract with South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai heavy Industries on the 28th of December 2021 with the shipbuilder delivering a variant of their hdc3100 hdf-3100 Corvette frigate design the ships are not yet named and construction is expected to start by 2022 already started Industries HDC 3100 Corvette design also known as the hdf-3100 frigate design will become The Benchmark designed for the Philippine Navy's future frigate it is an improved design of the hdf 2600 which was used on the Jose Rizal class frigate with a longer Hull to accommodate increased subsystem requirements of the Philippine Navy The Benchmark hdc3100 has a length of 116 meters a breadth of 14.8 meters how much is this car still 100 tons and will be have a combined Diesel and Diesel codad propulsion configuration allowing a maximum speed in excess of 25 knots and a range of up to four I kind of wonder sometimes what only ever make these like nuclear Powers because I know they have nuclear power Subs why not make a nuclear powered ship is there dangerous to that or something like that because I would think like nuclear power would be longer it can go longer it wouldn't use as much fuel why not to make a nuclear powered instead of these diesel ones 4 500 nautical miles it has space for a 76 millimeters primary Naval gun in a position a 16 cell VLS with space for 16 more behind the primary Naval gun torpedo Launches on both port and starboard sides and a gun-based close-in weapon system above the helicopter hanger aside from the ciws there is no more small caliber secondary gun as previously expected the space for the vertical launching system has been lengthened to accommodate a 16 cell system and helicopter landing deck also appears to have been lengthened to allow longer helicopter designs that must be intense to try to land on one of these but this is looking really good actually I wonder how fast it is that's why I know I don't know I really know how fast this thing is is this bad boy a speedy or is this baby going to be slow let me know in the comments down below

South Korea and Poland have agreed on strengthening their defense ties, pledging further military exchanges and industry cooperation.
That's according to Seoul's defense minister Lee Jong-sup after his high-level meeting with his Polish counterpart Mariusz Blaszczak (마리우스 부와슈차크).
The two officials held talks on Thursday during Lee's trip to Warsaw, agreeing to conduct joint military exercises and strengthen technological cooperation in order to bolster their defense capabilities.
Warsaw says it has ordered FA-50 fighter jets from Seoul, with Polish pilots already undergoing training in South Korea.
The ministers also expressed their mutual support for Ukraine, and Poland said it would actively back Seoul's efforts for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

2023-02-24, 09:30 (KST)",1,[Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] we're here to make a new type of news new insights new Styles and new topics every day we are news generation making news just for you it's February 24th here in Seoul I'm Xin Yoon and this is news generation where we make the news at anirang's very own Open studio every morning we'll discuss the top issues and latest current affairs affecting people in their 20s and 30s joining me in the studio is that it's Friday it's Friday now both are here to speak on behalf of those in their 20s and 30s now every day we do make news feed for the new generation and we're looking at the top trending hashtags on social media over the past 24 hours here they are the first hashtag is one year mark exactly a year ago today on February 24th Russian troops invaded Ukraine since then the two countries have been at War causing tens of thousands of debts and the largest Refugee crisis in Europe since World War II marking this somber anniversary the U.N Secretary General denounced moscale's Invasion as a violation of international law he also called out Russian threats and their potential use of nuclear weapons the second hashtag is 4.83 million statistics Korea on Thursday found out that the average monthly household income came to 4.83 million won or around 3 700 US dollars in the fourth quarter of last year though this was an increase of around four percent in just a year Authority cited inflation for the rise in other words real income has actually dropped for two consecutive quarters the third hashtag is developer according to a HR tech company 8 out of 10 people said they wanted to change their occupation as a whole the company surveyed roughly 900 people in January and most of these surveyed said if they chose to go back in time they would choose to become a software developer the second most popular occupation was a YouTuber survey participants said they wanted to change their current job title because of their low salary and pay raise opportunities now let's delve a bit deeper into the last hashtag developer as much as a lot of people aren't too happy with where they are in their career path many frequently look at other job offers and recruitment posts and there's a specific job post that went viral among youngsters here it was from a medium-sized company looking for a designer the offered salary was at fifteen hundred dollars for nine to six job and here's what threw people off so the requirement said the job post office for someone who could work till they puke it adamantly rejected anyone who would slack off or had no passion and people who saw this post were frustrated some left comments criticizing how the offered salary couldn't even reach the minimum wage and currently the minimum wage is at 9621 or around seven dollars forty cents per hour now you just saw this post right what did you think about this now um if the purpose of this job post was to make people laugh they succeeded but looking at this kind of job post reminded me of the term pay yeah that went around a long time ago amongst Millennials where employers didn't pay the workers enough money they were underpaid or even unpaid saying that hey we're giving you the opportunity to have your work experience that you want or need and giving you money on top of that is more than enough so a lot of employees were brainwashed and I was thinking about that I was thinking you know what money is a great source of passion and hard work exactly Money Talks source of motivation but there were a lot of people not like you Cube that left but they were frustrated they were actually quite angry with this then chihi could you define what the new generation thinks is actually an appealing and attractive job post sure well before that I think this particular job opening was completely outdated and it didn't understand what the Millennials want what they're seeking in a job well in my opinion the duties that I have to engage in are very important and also a high salary is also a very important factor and so I would apply for a job if they made me do things that I wanted to do and also if they paid me a lot of course I totally agree with kihoon that money is a great source of motivation for hard work but if the salary doesn't meet your expectations then I think the companies should at least list some other welfare benefits that can actually compensate for the lower salary and I think that's what a lot of the news Jen is looking for and that was our news feed for this Friday moving on we've been speaking of job recruitment posts so have you ever looked for a part-time job it's quite common among the new generation which is why we've chosen this as our discussion topic of the day part-time jobs are quite common in Korea especially among Millennials and gen Z who are still studying or have some free time workplaces range from convenience stores cafes and restaurants to homes where people tutor or babysit or on the roads where people deliver food or Parcels in recent years there has been growing concern about working conditions that's why the government has been raising the minimum wage currently it's 9620 Korean Won roughly seven US Dollars and 40 cents which is up by five percent from last year today news gen looks at three questions [Music] one what part-time jobs are trending among younger people in Korea these days two what type of work environment are Millennial gen Z part-timers looking for three wire a growing number of employers saying it's difficult to find young devoted part-time workers foreign as we just saw we're going to talk about the different part-time jobs than you Jen are taking these days and let's first find out if any of our panelists have ever tried part-time jobs starting with kihoon me I've tried many different types of part-time jobs growing up starting from painting houses working at a car wash cleaning big supermarkets before opening hours just to list a few but the most recent one I did uh was a one-off part-time job setting up an event hall for a one day special yoga class Wow have you tried one of those yoga classes oh well I'm a yogi myself but I haven't gone to an offline one recently because I do it online but how was it like uh it was quite okay because it was a high paying job compared to the number of hours I work but the only flip side would be having to look at so many females in yoga outfits in just one place and I didn't know where to look at so great I had to step outside until it finished overall I think I have a lot of work experience in terms of part-time jobs a few days ago we actually talked about whether it's okay to wear yoga pants at the office right but I guess inappropriate really well he was working but the rest of the yogis were just doing their job if men are allowed to wear yogis yoga pants as well yeah why not okay would you be okay looking at me wearing yoga pants I would like that [Laughter] skip what I have yeah it's diverse most of them were related to English I taught English in a little library for little younger students and I also taught English over the phone and I also helped interpret for these artists who came to perform in Korea in festivals that was pretty interesting yeah it was really fun and I also I used to be in a band back in college and My Band We performed behind this music video of a famous woman artist Salman tag really wow yes we were the background band we pretended to be playing all the instruments wait what instrument do you play I played the drum you're a drummer we have a drummer here at newsgen oh wow I want to see it one day exactly all the viewers want to see it yeah I'm a flutist I'm a flute she's a flutist yeah it's a little different vibe but moving on what do Millennials and gen Z aim to achieve through this various part-time jobs right so there was this recent survey done by arubamon I'm sure if you're a youngster living in Korea you've heard of of this site before it's a part-time job seeking site and 8 out of 10 young people have a goal they would like to achieve through the part-time experience they engage in so if we take a look at the screen for now there are four main goals that youngsters would like to achieve by engaging in part-time jobs so this survey was conducted on over 2 900 Millennials and Jen's ears engaging in part-time jobs and the respondents were able to choose multiple answers so it turned out that like I said 80 percent have something they'd like to accomplish through their experience and number one on the list was to save up money with 60 percent right and second was to earn money to flex I'm not surprised not surprised that's one of my reasons as well back when I was in university and that took up 33 percent and third on the list was to provide money to spend on their parents taking up 18 percent and last but not least fourth on the list was to gain work experience that was that accounted for 16 percent right right so other than these goals uh this the survey also found out that more than 75 percent of the young people who engage in part-time jobs want to live a better life we've talked about this before covering right so it's about living a fruitful productive life and making each day count through these part-time job expenses like God exactly and I agree when I did my part-time job I really like saved up at least 80 percent of them wow yeah because I wanted to go on a trip oh really yeah where I wanted to buy you buy your Chanel bag no I didn't I didn't earn too much money but cute what are some distinctive traits connected to Young part-timers these days I think many young part-timers look for practicality and convenience the most so for example they would look for jobs that are close to home oh and like almost like a walkable distance to save time and money and also they would uh prefer working on weekdays compared to weekends because it's less busy and of course they want to spend their weekends going out or just resting at home so the level of commitment and how long they work at a particular place one particular place has gone down with time especially with the advancement of Technology where e-commerce has become more prominent I think many youngsters prefer to work from home instead of being physically present workplace and doing physical labor I think that's the case especially with covid-19 everyone was using zoom in Skype so there's a lot of part-time jobs these days that require people to use these platforms right and cute a lot of employers though are saying because of the younger Generations traits it's hard to find a young devoted worker and according to another job recruitment site called 80 of employers have been ghosted really yeah by their part-time employees and for viewers who don't know what ghosted means it means when you don't show up for the interview or you suddenly don't show up to work or leave the workplace before their shift ends so that's why a lot of employers are saying it's just so hard to hire young part-timers what are your thoughts on this I have to agree but I think in my opinion it's the generation gap and the change in working behavior and environment like nowadays there's so much diverse different types of part-time jobs that pay you different hourly rates so I guess a lot more opportunities can arise now I'm not saying I'm supporting ghosting I'm really against it and it shouldn't really happen but I think it comes more from how youngsters have the attitude of not taking little things for example part-time jobs as seriously as the older generation used to and I was thinking it's also because they don't get penalized for ghosting maybe their friends have done it and they were they got away with it and I was thinking as well perhaps if it was an interview for Samsung would they have ghosted that interview I don't think so but keep on are you sure these are your friends you're talking about exactly you seem to know a lot I don't have any friends I'm my only friend is it you have you experienced have you ever experienced this now that you put me on the spot I think it's confession time okay confess up okay this happened a long time ago when I was young naive I ghosted just once I called in saying I was sick when I wasn't so I did apologize but the owner was very upset yeah so I disrupted his business for that day so I want to make this time an opportunity if you're watching this I'm pretty sure you know who you are I'm so sorry I hope your business is doing well and good luck for the future I'm very sorry and kiwul has been repenting Tiki would you like to use this opportunity to test anything I hope he's forgiven but it's not my thing oh really you shouldn't lie on live television not lying I'm not lying I've never missed a single day of work well I'm the bad guy yeah at least you confessed okay and you ask for forgiveness all right now why don't we include another Global Millennial who's also tried various part-time jobs and let's find out which part-time jobs are trending there and what type of work environment Millennials and gen Z are looking for around the world foreign [Music] we're now going to be speaking with a millennial from France who's currently working as a content manager it's maluli Cafe from France great to have you with us Maui hello hello I heard that you've tried a lot of part-time jobs before and what are some popular jobs among younger people in France and what type of workplace do the younger gen in France hope for well actually in France like the part-time job or a pretty classic you know it's like working in the small shops maybe like clothes shops and things like that or maybe as a waiter in restaurants or probably like maybe babysitting stuff like that but I think like what the younger people try to find out is like something like not too demanding in work so it's like too much stuff to do you know like and being like maybe have like some kind of flexible options like maybe like not like crazy hours of course and like something that worth their time so they even if the money is not really high at least it's like kind of worth the time they're spending during the the work and maybe also they can like try to find like some kind of nice environment like I would think I would think about like something nice spot a nice view or like some Advantage like you know discount or free food item or something like that maybe probably like that I see and do you two in the studio have any questions you'd like to ask my will we right I also have one uh why did this type of trend form though Maui well I think it's because like there is like always like some kind of demand like there is like always like some shops like during like maybe some season like you know the summer season stuff like that when like the demon is high so like they actually always try to find like some young people to work so it's like kind of accessible so it's not too difficult to find and it seems also the pay and the responsibilities and they're too high they will also like you know like kind of it's easier to find for like some people who doesn't have like merch experience or like you know like so it's easier to find like some I mean if you really want it you'll find like some work somewhere right yeah all right uh last question like similar to Korea is it harder for employers to find young people who want a part-time job I think the most difficult thing is not actually to find but maybe to keep them as you may be like you're also kind of already mentioned like maybe it's difficult to manage the people to manage the younger people so because they have like a different Vision maybe they're also more unstable they would like if they're not happy with the world they might think about changing and they would not be afraid of like quitting and trying something else so I think it's like something like really like um you really like uh that actually represent the younger generation like maybe the attention span is shorter something like that so if you like lose the focus if they're like losing the interest you know and like so they will like also I guess have minimum implication in the work so like you'll be like you have to be really careful if you want to keep them in your all right is this based on your experience probably yeah it sounds very personal I mean no I'm just like observing you know I'm not I'm not like that but when I was younger I kept most of my my work that I was not really there I was more like as a secure type of person so I was a little bit afraid of losing my stuff so like for me like I worked as a like teacher and stuff like that so it was I was really into it I wanted to keep it I was like I feel it was interesting so I guess maybe that's why I didn't left I see all right thank you so much Molly it was a pleasure to have you here and hear about what the younger gen in France was like thank you for having me thank you thank you now if we break the discussion back to the studio any points that Molly made that fascinating you well I think it's quite Universal that uh the Millennials the Gen Z's they would like not to demanding work uh and it's and make easy money really but I think that's also why many people are refraining from engaging in the 3D kind of work the difficult dangerous and dirty sort of work right the 3D work what about that I totally agree with you um the younger youngsters these days they it's hard to really manage them and keep them at a workplace for a long time so I think there needs to be kind of like a better understanding between the employee and the employer so it's something that we need we all need to work on right and what I found fascinating was last comment made by ramuli it's not hard to find young people who are ready to work it's hard to keep them there and that's something that's been happening here in Korea as well and all right given that we are a live morning program we always ask our viewers questions related to our discussion topic in advance we use this time to share with what they had to say on our topic today so we asked our viewers what part-time jobs that had that they've done or what type of jobs were common in their home countries Tiffany X tomorrow said in San Antonio Texas the most popular part-time jobs are theme parks stores and restaurants I've held many jobs at Six Flags Fiesta Texas since the age of 16. pmgw said in his home country Poland to which I've not been in 10 years some popular part-time jobs were a support associate student coordinator Salon and Spa front desk restaurant host and delivery driver wow those are a lot and Ms said when I was in college I was a host at a restaurant my duties included greeting and seating the desks scheduling reservations and busing tables now what do you guys think about our viewers comments well I have something to say about Tiffany's comment I wonder how the theme park part-time job was like because back in college I saw this posting on working for a theme park work but I wasn't confident with doing all the like hello you know welcome it's like I couldn't do that yeah but it was a good paint job paint job exactly and they have such a melodical tune oh they do and what about you cute I'm just commenting on pmgw and ms's comment um working at a restaurant I've worked at many different restaurants as well it's a very common part-time job for many youngsters as well it's fun but daunting at the same time because especially if you work at a busy restaurant it becomes crazy yeah yeah because like you don't you have to know which tables to serve people will be you know pressing the bells yelling at you wanting their food and if you don't calculate the right table with the right right amount you'll get in trouble by the boss oh really yeah so it sounds but what I thought is because back in college I mostly did a lot of part-time jobs related to English and I really wanted to try what Tiffany mentioned as well the theme park right and just you know scheduling reservations at a restaurant I thought it's never too late you guys might find me somewhere at a restaurant yeah is available exactly now all right we do upload questions related to our discussion topic for our viewers to answer and if you want to participate please search adiram news on YouTube look into our community tab the link is right below now we've already come to the final part of our discussion for today and how do you guys think part-time jobs will evolve and do you think companies and business owners will change their work Styles according to the traits of Millennials and gen Z well I think ayobamon of the part-time job seeking site put it in a very good manner summarize it really well so companies and business owners they said must rep respect part-timers as professional workers and at the same time the young part-timers they should respect their work more and show more professional attitude so this way uh part-time jobs will be respected more and they will find they'll be more acknowledged for these sort of work as well and I also think companies and part-time jobs it won't be just for the younger generation teacher right older Generations are more and more engaging in these jobs as well so that will be a new trend in the future I guess and what are your thoughts like I mentioned before it's finding it's more about finding a common ground and finding ways to constructively coexist and to work together between owners and part-timers because owners need to realize that they do need part-timers for the business to run more smoothly effectively and efficiently and and of course like what gee said you know part-timers should be a little more professional and responsible for what they're doing because they are getting paid at the end of the day so I think these ways could be you know good measures to mitigate the difference in working Styles between Generations definitely and even though it may be a part-time job it's still a job you should get it done all right and today we talked about part-time jobs and which type of jobs young people in Korea like the most and will be here every day from 9 30 a.m to 10 a.m Korea time bringing you the topics that young people are talking about special thanks to titihi thank you thank you for having me and thank you everyone for watching we'll see you next week we are news generation [Music] come on [Music]
qrKWxCVe2rE,"BOK keeps base rate at 3.5%, ending longest-running series of rate hikes","한국은행, 기준금리 연 3.5%로 동결

Today, South Korea's central bank announced a key rate freeze at three and a half percent, pausing rate hikes that continued for more than a year.
And amid economic concerns, the bank has slightly cut this year's growth forecast.
Our finance correspondent Kim Yeon-seung with more.

The Bank of Korea has reined in its longest-running series of rate hikes for now.
The central bank governor announced after Thursday's monetary policy committee meeting that it will keep its base interest rate at 3-point-five percent.

""With so many economic uncertainties, we've decided that it would be appropriate right now to keep rates where they are and asses all the current risks.""

This plateau in rates comes after ten hikes in the last 18 months, 
including seven consecutive raises before this latest decision.
The non-stop rate hikes were aimed at countering inflation, driven up in part by Russia's war on Ukraine, now about to enter its second year. 
But now, there's a new economic risk --China's reopening. 
With its impact on the South Korean economy yet unclear, the central bank has decided that it's time to tread lightly. 
There's also the slowing economy.
The bank expects economic growth this year to come in at one-point-six percent, revised down from its original forecast of 1-point-7 percent.
The central bank also shaved a tenth of a percentage point off its previous projection for this year's inflation --from 3-point-6 percent to 3-point-5 percent.

""If prices are going where we expect, then we don't see a need to raise rates and tighten further. But as we keep rates steady, we do need to look at the effects of our policies so far. ""

However, South Korea is not yet out of the woods when it comes to inflation. 
There are also concerns about the weakening of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar, expected to be aggravated when the Federal Reserve moves forward with more rate hikes, while South Korea stays put. 

""Thursday's decision does not signal an end to monetary tightening.
All but one committee member on Thursday saw another raise of 25 basis points in the future as an optimal place to stop.
So there may be more rate hikes coming up.

s0MyuUbZy6c,The US-Europe-China Triangle: A Great Decoupling? (BFPF 2020 – English),"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the process of decoupling between
Washington and Beijing. The deterioration in US-Chinese relations puts Europe in a difficult position as it increases the threat of coercion from both sides. How can cooperation between the US and China be maintained? Should Germany act as a mediator or position itself on one side or another? And which measure must the EU undertake to secure economic sovereignty for its member states?

#Europa #USelections #China",1,[Music] [Music] ladies and gentlemen welcome back to our afternoon discussion on the u.s europe-china triangle a great decoupling since the beginning of the pandemic china's central place in many global supply chains came to haunt the us and europe but the trend towards decoupling has started long before with the new u.s president biden will the u.s chinese trade war continue which actions should the eu take to protect itself against economic coercion and how should germany position itself we have a stellar lineup to discuss these questions today let me introduce our speakers we have with us today from berlin dr stormy anika mildner she's the head of the department for external economic policy at the federation of german industries and she will be from january on the executive director of aspen institute germany she argued in a policy paper from last year that decoupling is not a sensible strategy for the u.s gold alone is bound to fail we also have with us from cambridge massachusetts professor joseph nye he's university distinguished service professor emeritus and the former dean of the harvard's kennedy school of government he argued in an article in foreign policy china will not benefit from the covet 19 pandemic and the united states will remain preeminent we also have with us from beijing dr caiu jin she's associate professor of economics at the lse and she made the case that the corona virus crisis could be the opportunity of the century for china to cement its place as a global power and then we also have with us from singapore professor kishore marbubani distinguished fellow at the national university of singapore he argued in his latest book has china one that the united states has lost its way and china has found its way in the past decades thank you all for joining us today dear livestream viewers you can contribute your questions and comments to this discussion via our platform or via twitter using the hashtag belinforum and dear participants and speakers thank you for joining us despite and coming together despite very different time zones for this discussion let's start right away with the tough questions and my first one would go to you dr milner president-elect biden reportedly wants to work closer together with europeans on china in a bid for collective leverage against beijing so if a phone call comes from the new white house asking germany to take collective action against china what should bulin's answer be should it be yes for the sake of transatlantic relations well first of all thanks for having me and uh thanks for organizing this wonderful and very timely event so you said it's going to be a tricky question and i would say um it is not an easy question to to answer um maybe um let me start with a couple of preliminary remarks before i then get to the center of the question and the first one is the assumption that um indeed we will continue to have geopolitical tensions despite the outcome of the elections in the united states it's not going to go away it's not going to be rosy because the conflict is so much more than just about individual actors persons it is also more than an economic in a conflict of economic interests it is really a conflict about values and a competition of systems and also a competition of spheres of influence and um this is important to to to keep in mind when we talk about also reactions um to this but that's my first preliminary um observation so so to say oh my assumption it's not gonna go away my second assumption is that the eu and also germany have been in the past been a lot of times in the middle between this great power conflict of these big superpowers um and i'm not saying that the eu is not an actor in itself and also um pretty pretty influential but um if the u.s and the eu are so to say heavyweights in the boxing ring we are i would say more medium weight i wouldn't say lightweight but medium weight and um while those two have been exchanging punches sometimes we got into the middle of these uh of this fight um because our decision making is sometimes slower we also have diverging views within the eu and our instruments are maybe not as sharp and and well targeted as they probably should be to make us a heavyweight in this in this power game so that's my second second preliminary assumption so to say so coming coming to your question what does it mean for germany um and i would say the first thing is we um in economic terms are pretty small and our power comes from the eu so we have to go the way via the eu so the answer needs to be this is in a policy field if we talk about trade where um we need to take into consideration that it's um uh something which where we have given our competence to the eu level i'm not saying that we are not very influential um but nonetheless i mean it is of eu competence and that makes us actually so much stronger than if we were going going along and the eu needs to formulate um and germany should take a leading role in this should formally formulate its interests and work together with the united states on issues like subsidies forced technology transfer but also human rights violations um and join up together with the united states to ensure a better level playing field with china let me take a path for you yeah um and then i ended here i'm sorry i get carried away it's good that you interrupted me um but yes so the way is via the via the eu let me let me take this a bit further push you perhaps a little bit more on this um economic minister altmeier he warned a few weeks ago that german companies should reduce dependencies on china and seek alternatives in asia does germany's economic dependence on china limit its leverage when it comes to politically difficult decisions i'm thinking of huawei 5g the fate of the uyghurs and hong kong no i don't think so i mean first of all about 60 of our of our trade takes place within the european union the united states is our most important export market that already underlines how important other strategic or other partners are in this i'm not saying that the chinese market isn't important it is very important and that's why i think the coupling isn't isn't isn't the answer and it's also not a possibility um but let me say for a long time also german german industry german business had the hope that china would eventually open up democracize itself player play a better more constructive role in international relations and this hope has been very disappointed and that led us at bdi to a recalibration of our position in the last three years we put out a pretty pretty substantial policy paper which also made some headwinds in brussels and also in washington where we did very clearly um formulate that we need to have a tougher stance towards china to make it more play play by the rules um so the answer is is no no decoupling but at the same same time we need definitely a tougher stance towards towards china and sharpen our instruments um in the trade sphere thank you let me take this to professor nai um anthony blinken the u.s new state secretary u.s state secretary to be he also argued that it is unrealistic and a mistake to fully decouple from china but at the same time president biden will be under pressure and a lot of pressure not to appear soft on china since at least it seems that in washington at the moment a hard line on beijing is one of the few issues where republicans and democrats can agree how much room for maneuver will a president biden have to adjust policies towards china but also towards europe well i think there's actually more consensus here than than uci there has been a debate in washington recently about decoupling from china and the so-called new cold war this really is uh exaggerated political rhetoric and not very useful as a way to think about the problem and fortunately uh tony lincoln and joe biden don't participate in that type of rhetoric there is a problem which is there's some areas where there will have to be decoupling uh which touched security the pandemic reaffirmed this in people's minds that supply chains have to think of just in case as well as just in time but i think the uh important thing to realize is that complete decoupling economically would be foolish and that um in the ecological area of areas like climate and health and so forth decoupling is impossible as i argue in the new book i publish due morals matter we have to realize that there is a power over others for example american competition with china over the law of the sea in the south china sea there's also power with others in which you can't get what you want if you try to get it alone and if you look at areas like climate which is a top priority for biden and you look at areas like pandemic which is a top priority for our country you can't do this without cooperating with china so the idea of decoupling that makes no sense when you refer to these ecological interdependencies so there is a middle ground here and if we can stay away from these uh hawkish statements and these exaggerated metaphors about a new cold war and ask how do we find a way to compete with china and cooperate with china simultaneously i think that's very much the approach that the biden administration will be taking thank you professor nai if we look a little bit deeper into into domestic politics it seems that there are deep divisions on the issue of trade within the democratic party so we have moderates that see trade agreements as a key to american prosperity and peace and then we have rather left-wing democrats who blame trade agreements as being responsible for hurting american workers so how can biden balance progressives and moderates within his own party well uh that's a problem actually in both political parties under trump you've seen that um the suspicion of trade agreements uh it has now changed the position of the republicans remember it was trump who withdrew from the trans-pacific partnership which the obama administration had negotiated whether biden will be able to rejoin the tpp or not or it's now called cptpp uh is very much questioned in domestic politics but the idea of trying to play a larger role in trade is i think something that's shared in the administration but the domestic politics of how you get this done you're correct it's going to be difficult thank you um dr jin you argued in a recent article that beijing's worst nightmare would be a visionary u.s president with convening power is president-elect biden this visionary president and has beijing's nightmare come too uh well i think there's uh much to be seen uh in that regard and i don't think beijing really knows uh what it will be facing in the coming months but what is clear uh is that the u.s china relationship is an absolute priority for the chinese leadership and maintaining as best as possible a relationship and of course improving upon it would also be its main priority and uh working uh on uh expanding the scope of collaboration will be a key theme with a new administration in the us not only just with the us but also with europe i think the best way or the way that i would you know we would characterize this the nature of the u.s chinese relationship in china is a tripart system which is politically oppositional competitive and global public goods collaborative as professor and i have mentioned in all these areas and i think it is possible to have coexistence and acceptance of differences uh having all these three things at the same time and that i think is really pretty much an accommodation to reality rather than some overarching goal i think that in terms of economic scope uh it's important to realize that beijing is ready to talk i think in the last few years both sides went straight to the fighting without the dialogue and the new administration can hold a dialogue and that is actually what the beijing in beijing wants to see and can can hope for i don't agree with the fact that china is going to maintain its economic approach and will have no chance of changing some of the things that was mentioned that was kind of yesterday's playbook we have to understand that china has a new playbook and the world is a little bit slow to catch up there is a lot of indigenous technological efforts striving for independence this is pushed by the u.s china trade war but even more so with a greater alienation of china from the other countries uh and there is also the brave you know kind of the um the preparation for greater independence uh on the supply chains and on trade what meanwhile china still wants to emphasize that it wants to be an integrated part of the global economy hence the dual circulation policy that has put forth to embrace globalization but also to be kind of more prepared uh for independence but also lastly i would add that china is going through the kind of the most profound most expansive financial liberalization that's opening up that it has ever seen in the last 30 40 years and that creates a lot of opportunities and a level playing field for many of these foreign institutions so i think it's fundamentally impossible to change china's economic model which is a strong presence of the state but it's definitely very feasible to have china change many of the approaches to have china open up and to create this open competition with foreign institutions thank you stormy anika milner just argued that germany should take a tougher stance on china so what if a future biden administration succeeds to convince partners and allies to adopt a tougher approach towards shine china what would be beijing's reaction what would we have to expect i think that beijing's already prepared um or it's preparing itself for this this scenario and uh uh other than uh trying to i think china beijing is very welcome to using the multilateral approach to have these negotiations and to um have dialogues and many of these contested areas but as i mentioned the reaction or the long-term preparation for this kind of scenario is for greater independence economically in terms of supply chain and most importantly in terms of technology so i absolutely agree that in the sphere of certain kind of technologies um there we could see greater uh if not complete severance greater uh greater independence thank you um professor mahbubbani last week we saw that 50 nations across the asia pacific signed the regional comprehensive economic partnership which brings together 2.2 billion people and around 30 percent of the world's economic output would you argue that this is a sign of china's rising and u.s declining power or is this rather more symbolic action than substance well let me see firsthand it's a real pleasure to be on this panel with my old friends young friends uh joseph nye kyujin and to be with all of you and my simple answer to your question is that the regional comprehensive economic partnership is a real game changer and i think it's going to confirm in an accelerated fashion that the 21st century will be the asian century and the reason why will be the asian century is that the economic growth of most of the economic growth of the world is going to come from asia and let me just give you one statistic that illustrates how fast things are changing over here so that you understand how fast things are happening in asia in the year 2009 the size of the retail goods market in china was 1.8 trillion dollars and united states was four trillion dollars more than double that of china fast forward 10 years later in 2019 the size regional goods market in china is six trillion dollars united states is 5.5 trillion dollars and now with the dual circulation uh uh sort of a method of development that is being used by china china is going to grow enormously but at the same time what i talk about china's important role i also want to emphasize that the story of asia is not about china alone and i think that for example the regional comprehensive economic partnership with the western media has been declaring is a chinese proposal chinese effort is rubbish if china had proposed it it wouldn't have happened it would have died the reason why it happened is because the 10 asean countries proposed it and the 10 asean countries had already signed free trade agreements with australia new zealand with south korea with japan and with china and that's why it happened so you when you focus on china alone you don't understand the asian story at all and more importantly asean very quietly managed to pull off a miracle because the three largest economies in northeast asia are china japan and south korea and guess what the three of them couldn't sign a free trade agreement with each other because of all the suspicions with each other so guess who did this who delivered the trade agreement that got china japan and south korea to push aside their suspicions and come together that was asean and the reason i'm telling all this is that many americans and many europeans just don't get it asia is a very different place and you have to understand the complexities of asia and then you can deal with asia and at the same time all of east asia wants to work with the united states all of east asia wants to work with europe so when everyone sees these zero-sum games this sort of zero-sum competition you get it all wrong and yeah i must say i'm greatly encouraged by what my friend joseph and i said he says at the end of the day there is a sort of a consensus in in the united states you got to compete but you also have to cooperate and i would say the message to u.s message to eu is that asia is ready to cooperate let's start now thank you for this passionate plea professor mabubani i'm sure that our other speakers on this panel would like to comment on on this too but let me follow up with one question since we're here at the berlin foreign policy forum um in in in germany um germany and france have recently placed a bigger emphasis on the indo-pacific and have adopted strategy strategies on the indo-pacific there were calls for the eu to speak out more strongly on tensions in the regions what do you think how much leverage the you and eu member states really have in the region is this just talk or do you expect the eu really to have a serious role in the indo-pacific in the future well for a start uh two two points uh number one indo-pacific concert and by the way incidentally just just to illustrate the complexity there are many different indo-pacific complex uh concepts floating around there's one floated by washington dc and is by the trump administration it's an effort to bring together india as a counterbalance uh to china but there's another one promoted by indonesia uh which is a much more inclusive uh concept indo-pacific that does not is not the rest ganging up against china just to illustrate the example of complexities but we would love to see india play a bigger role in the region and which is why i can tell you all of east asia felt very sad when india which had been negotiating for 10 years to join the regional comprehensive economic partnership decided not to do so but as you know the rcep has kept the window open for india to join and we hope you'll do so but in terms of what germany and france can do you know if you don't mind i'll be very candid with you please we would love to see europe play a bigger role in east asia but please be realistic okay i mean this is not the 19th century where decisions made in paris london berlin influenced the course of world history i mean that's the 19th century we are in the 21st century and so and and i can tell you this all of asia would like to see europe play a bigger leadership role and especially a bigger leadership blow in promoting global multilateralism in the way that macron does so passionately with his speeches we love multilateralism asia loves multilateralism and frankly at the end of the day if you want to constrain china guess what the best way to constrain china is through multilateralism right so what europe should do is give up any pretensions that it is some kind of great power still it is not but it can still play a positive role but a realistic role which understands its limitations and say okay let's take the multilateral rule and guess what asia would welcome european multilateralism we would love it and we will support it passionately thank you professor mabubani let me take this back to dr milner about the eu's role in the region and as always the problem with the eu is how to speak with one voice in a region or in a policy area it was germany stated aim during the eu council presidency to bring member states closer together at least when it comes to china to counter format such as the 17 plus one from the chinese side but the eu leaders meeting in leipzig was postponed and negotiations over an investment agreement are still dragging on so has germany failed its aim to bring the european union closer together in china uh first of all i think we need to see it also a little bit in the context of the corona crisis right um yeah so some of the big ambitions for the eu council presidency could also just not been fulfilled because there was a lot of management to do with regard to stimulus packages and rallying the eu member states together to manage the corona crisis and that is still a big big challenge on trade policy issues i could not agree more that the eu member states are a lot of times not unified not just on on the matter of china but on trade policy um as as a whole um and this is this weakens the european union for sure um and we need to um and and you could also say that um that there is not not a not a drift or rift but um it it it's become even more difficult um to negotiate uh to sign and to ratify trade agreements um in the last years and that definitely weakens the eu um also also in the region i just looked up some numbers again the us has four trade agreements um and in in the region the us six is negotiating for others um china has seven but if you count the countries with which china has trade agreements it's um more than 14 um and um that that creates a sphere of influence and the eu is um not lagging behind majorly but but a little bit and we do have to make i think some some tough decisions with regard to how how many things do we want to put into trade agreements and how high our ambitions are supposed to be if i look at rcep for example it's not that ambitious with regard to market access or with regard to rules with regard to sustainability and so on there are some countries in there which are our strategic partners and which are high standard countries japan new zealand and australia we have an agreement with japan with very high standards really high standards also on sustainability we negotiate we are currently negotiating an agreement with new zealand and australia also with really high standards but we are not part of other initiatives because the standards are too low so i think we have to be a little careful that in the end we won't be too much too alone with following our high standards i'm not saying we should give up high standard but it's a price to pay um something we definitely need into consideration and that is currently a debate that you has to um has to find an answer to and that is something which is ongoing so i'm not surprised that this isn't something which is solved um in a couple of weeks or in a couple of months under the eu german eu presidency that takes a little longer we just have to be careful that the world doesn't move on too much without us um in the meantime that's a very good point um dr jin um it was interesting that during the first wave of the pandemic there was a lot of concern about the slowdown of the chinese economy and the consequences for the world economy but it seems now that china's economy was the first into the covet crisis but also the first out and that relates to what you just said about the new independence model of the chinese economy now china is leading the way in the economic recovery from corona so what can we what lessons can we learn from china in this regard is this model to become more independent less dependent on experts a model that in the end others should also follow to protect themselves i think that greater independence which is um it is something that countries should prepare themselves to to be ready for uh mostly because the pandemic has shown that there is a certain fragility in the system um and uh but still if we look at the data um it's very clear and this relates to uh the previous topic about trade um it's very regionalized right there are three big countries uh that are at the center of the global supply chain or production chain uh china in asia germany in europe and the united states and most of the relationship is kind of most of linkages are regional so i think that will remain uh what is true is that there will be greater need for critical independence on you know let's say ppe uh and critical supplies and that will change some of the economic strategies but i don't think this is the right way forward i don't think that all countries should just prepare for greater independence and have it i think we should just still emphasize on glo global crop cooperation and collaboration but as you know professor knight said from just in time perfect optimization efficiency to also just in case and there's a lot to be done there's greater transparency and information in supply chains greater communication more diversification of suppliers lots of things could be done to create more resilience in the system and i just might want to add that even though china's economic numbers look like it's on the path to recovery uh two points here one is the exports figures didn't look that bad in china much much better than expected uh because from for the simple reason that china was the last factory open for a long period of time now we might not expect that these export numbers will be so great uh the year after when the world starts to recover so i wouldn't read that so um so so uh you know on the surface the second thing is that there's a big difference between rebound and recovery recovery the path to recovery could be a very long time maybe even 10 years a decade if we look at the recent crises in the last 20 30 years in the west in particular in the us employment recovered slower and slower so it's very important to distinguish rebound and recovery and in china we're seeing an enormous rebound but again to go back to the pre-crisis trend trend growth and development i think there will need to be a lot of work and one of the most one of the more important things is to prevent this real economy issues to percolate into the financial system and cause a financial crisis especially when we're seeing unprecedented levels of debt around the world thank you dr jin one more question to you there was also this narrative especially at the beginning of the pandemic that we are past peak globalization that this level of economic integration that we have has gone too far and perhaps brings more pain and less gain the idea that we are heading towards deglobalization perhaps even does the data back up this narrative or wouldn't you agree subscribe to this idea i don't personally subscribe to this idea and i don't think the data confirms that globalization is the biggest uh cause of this growing inequality i think the divergence between the elites and the general public the elites and the grassroots especially industrialized countries is more of a domestic issue within these domestic countries than a globalization issue if we look at what globalization has brought us there has been more convergence less global inequality than there is more inequality but within country inequality especially rich countries have grown and this is not mostly due to globalization this is primarily due to technology so if we think about what are the main challenges for the world today and for each of the countries these are not these are transnational challenges right this is artificial intelligence and automation displacing jobs how do we have a new infrastructure to think about technology to think about financial technology how to regulate these technology companies these are transnational issues but yet we are focused on us versus them we're focused on competition we're focused on a zero-sum game but we should be working together to solve some of the most fundamental uh problems of the near future thank you um professor and i would like to give back something to you that professor mabubani just said it's going to be the asian century you argued that the u.s will remain preeminent and the conflict between the us and china as dr milner said is not only about economics it's also about two different political systems and who will design the world order of the future why are you so optimistic that the us will remain preeminent and what can a president biden do to revive the so-called liberal international order well first let me say that i agree with my friend kishore about asia and the world economy i i wrote this in a book the future of power 10 years ago that we should see the 21st century as not the rise of asia but the return of asia after all if you go back to 1800 or 1700 asia was by far the largest part of the world economy as well as the world's population so what we're seeing is a natural return of asia this century but as kishore properly said don't confuse the return of asia or the rise of asia with the rise of china china has risen but notice that china is only part of asia and asia has its own internal balance of power which means that countries like japan are the third largest national economy in the world india the world's about to become the world's most populous country and australia as well as countries like vietnam and others don't want to be dominated by china they want to have a situation where they can benefit from china the price of china but they would welcome an american participation in the region because it helps to balance chinese power in that sense the americans have a tremendous advantage in asset which is we're not directly threatening any of these countries where several of the countries in the region feel threatened by chinese power and chinese growth so that's why i think the americans will continue to play an important role in addition to that if we look at power in a global sense if the united states and japan and europe hold together and they certainly as as ms mildner said have commonality of values if these countries hold together their combined economic and political weight is much greater than any place that china will be in the next 20 30 years if you just ask will china chinese economy grow larger than the u.s economy in gross domestic product probably sometime in the 2030s yes that's not the same as econo as military power or the u.s has a much larger global advantage and it's not the same as soft power where the americans again are shown by most polls to be well in advance but the key point is if we act together with europe and with japan we can perform a balancing role in which you can shape the environment so that china can rise responsibly and that means the prospects of a rule-based international order uh are not so bad after all so i i go back to what uh kishore said don't confuse the the fact that a asian century exists with the fact that a chinese century exists it's not necessarily a chinese century many asians welcome the united states participation and as we heard welcome european participation you just said we should stay together and european should stay together next year we will have elections in germany so the german chancellor merkel who was dubbed as the leader of the free world a couple of years ago will be gone are you concerned about this prospect well i i'm an admirer of chancellor merkel i think she's done a remarkable job as a political leader uh but i'm also quite reassured by the structure of democracy in germany i'm sure there will be another german leader of uh of impressive qualities and also remember that we as we as ms milner said earlier uh think of germany not just as germany but as europe and uh when you put europe together with its democratic traditions internally and with its multilateral attitudes externally um i'm not worried about the fact that germany will have elections next year thank you um professor mahpubani um i would like to quote some survey results from our berlin pulse survey that we conduct every year and we've asked the germans in germany and we've asked the germans in this survey whether they think it is somewhat or very likely that the u.s chinese confrontation will turn into a new cold war a term that was already mentioned in our discussion the result was that 49 percent of germans said they think it is somewhat of very likely and 47 percent said it's somewhat or very unlikely so germans are divided on this question we asked the same question in cooperation with the pew research center in the u.s and there the result was that 59 percent of u.s americans think it is somewhat of very likely that we will see a new cold war between the us and china what should be done to avert this fate a topic very central in your book very simple answer to your question to avoid the worst case scenario read my book has china one but you know i think it's a big mistake uh to use the term cold war i mean as you know in europe so well during the cold war how much trade did germany do with the soviet union like almost zero okay now today tell me one in three volkswagen cars are sold in china one in four mercedes-benz cars are sold in china one in four bmw cars are sold in china and and guess what where is the big new market for german products it's in china and and by the way i agree with i i emphasize china but i completely agree with joe nice point that asia is much larger than china and frankly if you look at the market for volkswagen bmw's mercedes it's also in asia so this is not a cold war yes there will be a major geopolitical contest between united states and china and in my view is driven by structural forces by the fact that number one power always pushes down the number two power is driven by the fear the yellow peril is driven by the disappointment that china hasn't become a democracy the structural forces driving this but this doesn't mean that this contest is irreversible i must say i felt greatly encouraged in this discussion listening to joseph nye because i think if washington dc listens to joseph nye and also acknowledges that this is not the old cold war the past and indeed you have many many common interests between united states and china the first common interest is kovit 19. and you know frankly if kovite 19 is an enemy of china and kovite 19 is an enemy of america the enemy of my enemy is my friend that's why mr churchill fell in love with starving to fight hitler but therefore us and china should work together first to kill kovite 19 it's in a common interest to do so secondly global warming and as i say in my book if u.s and china keep fighting while global warming is happening future historians will see them as two tribes of eggs fighting each other while the forest around them was burning it's absolutely crazy thing to do that's what apes do but not human beings so if you are really smart intelligent thoughtful we should understand that the common interest between united states and china in dealing with many global challenges are far more important than the differences and this is where frankly i hope europe will come in the most useful contribution that europe can make is to say hey there are more pressing global challenges in the world and that's what all of asia is saying by the way privately whenever american diplomats come to southeast asia there was only one message they hear from some musicians don't make us choose we don't get involved in this conflict we have more important things to do and that's what europe should also say so if europe and the rest of asia can work together to persuade us and china that there are far more important things for the world to do than getting stuck in this headlong conflict then we would have made a very positive constructive contribution and frankly that that's the main goal of my book as china one to try and persuade them stop this stop this they're more important things to do and i hope europe will speak out more loudly in that dimension professor mafubani we already have some questions coming in from our live stream so let me take one question from there and put it directly to you it concerns the belt and road initiative china's belt and vote initiative which was criticized for creating debt traps to countries that have subscribed to this belt and vote initiative the question is is this really a purely economic project or to what extent does it imply a form of soft power ideology and international influence that could rival the united states well uh two or three quick points point number one there is no dead threat diplomacy there is a peer-reviewed academic article by the way i think the author's name is deborah brottingham google and find it you will find that it is not true absolutely not true that there's debt threat diplomacy the data shows this and by the way countries choose whether or not to do this at the end of the day not and three common examples sri lanka and malaysia that are given malaysians are still participating in the belt and road forum and the second point i'll make about the belt and road initiative is that at the end of the day countries can uh are capably free to decide the 193 member states of the u.n they're absolutely free to decide do they want to join the belt and road initiative or not join this free complete freedom of choice so united states is not joining japan is not joining india is not joining australia is not joining that's okay perfectly reasonable you are free to join not join but out of 193 countries in the world 127 countries have decided to join the belt and road initiative 127 countries in the world so stupid really i mean they don't know what what is good for them and you know i give you an example singapore's biggest neighbor indonesia what is indonesia's biggest priority infrastructure who's going to build the infrastructure in indonesia who's going to give them prices that are reasonable and guess what infrastructure lifts people from poverty so there's perfectly good reasons why so many countries all the countries in southeast asia orton have joined the belt and road initiative and they all want to build the infrastructure so you please i would strongly encourage those who hear the anglo-saxon narrative on belt and road initiative to counter-balance it by looking at the data and looking at the facts and i am very confident that the belt and road initiative will become stronger and stronger and if you meet at the same time next year more countries would have joined it thank you professor mafubani dr miller did you want to come in if i may um on the keyword of counter balancing um and i would take it to to a different aspect of counter balancing because i do believe that the road and belt initiative is more than um it could an economic project but it is also a project of um in well spheres of influence and also of spreading a certain governance model um and i think we need to counter balancing balance this with an initiative and one which comes to mind is the dot initiative and that would allow us in infrastructure projects government procurement to implement and ensure some of the standards which are dear not only to the european heart but also to the american part and when we talk about possible cooperation projects i think that would be one in the transatlantic relationship thank you um there's one question coming in from the audience from kai brinkman and i would give this to you dr jin professor barney already commented on the rcep and kai brinkmann's question is how can china be hatched and kept from ultimately dominating rcep not only in economic but in political terms i don't think there's any uh intention for china to export its development model it has no moral universalism like the u.s in the post-war i think that china presents an interesting case of study for some developing countries but it by no means wants to export any kind of development economic political or governance uh models for that and uh uh you know china wants to stress on a regional uh cooperation as as uh the discussion has revolved around uh you know asia is much bigger than china uh that's uh that's definitely you know in line with its own strategic objectives as well thank you professor and i would you agree that china does not want to project any governance model there's also this narrative that the idea to bring china in into the global system into the wto to make it a more responsible stakeholder has failed well i agree with professor jin that xi jinping's china is very different from mao china uh indeed in the 1960s uh people were marching through the streets or organizing in south american jungles uh in support of maoism you don't find anybody marching through the streets in support of xi jinping thought with chinese characteristics as it's put in the communist party uh constitution uh so in that sense i don't think china is trying to do an export model what they are and also not many countries can accomplish what china's accomplished they don't have the domestic structure and population for uh emulating the chinese on the other hand china is very concerned about protecting its authoritarian system so it's quite prepared to use its economic power to punish countries overseas who might do things or say things that might seem threatening to chinese communist party control just look what they did recently to australia with their 14 complaints about australia's raising the question of whether there should be an independent panel to look at the questions of the early transmission of the coven-19 virus china has behaved very badly that way you can find a whole number of cases where they punish countries or groups overseas basically protect against what they see as ideas that threaten them in china so in that sense is a soft power threat china is not a sole power threat to us uh we are for better or worse just by our example a soft power threat to them and that means there will be some ideological conflict but we ought to try to minimize it rather than maximize it thank you and if i may add one more question to you in this regard how do you expect tensions around taiwan then to develop in in the coming years well the taiwan question is a is a very potentially very dangerous point of friction the u.s policy has been to greatly simplify it no unilateral declaration of independence no use of force and within the boundaries of that box let the two sides of the taiwan's trait negotiate their relationships if uh as china becomes stronger and presses harder to get the uh pressure on taiwan this could create a friction because the u.s under the time on relations act of the 1970s says it has an interest and commitment to the security of taiwan so i think the important thing we're going to see in going to have to see is ways to uh maintain the status quo and let evolution take its time uh it's not impossible but it is a dangerous point of potential friction thank you there's one more question to stormy anika mildner from barbara ponquatz in our live stream she asks do you see any advantages for the eu and its companies if the us and china continue with the decoupling ambitions especially in the tech field so could there perhaps be advantages instead of only disadvantages for german and european economies well an advantage it would be if we advance our strategic also digital autonomy but if we remain open and also sharpen our our instruments to counter unfair trade policies i mean that would really be an advantage it would not be an advantage if the decoupling continues or if we get kind of in the middle of this great power game i don't think that if two are fighting then the third one is going to be the winner i mean the european union strives from being integrated into global markets our prosperity well-being stability but also i would say even peace depends on our integration into the world economy um and it would certainly not not be of our advantage um if the decoupling continues but at the same time we do have to work on our own competitiveness we do have to work on on infrastructure on education and research and development we should do that independent of what's going on in china and the united states because it's in our vital interest to be competitive and to invest resources um in these in in in these fields and you said at the beginning that germany is not a heavyweight but also not a low weight can germany mediate between the united states and china in the the coming weeks and months ahead that's something that minister economic minister admire suggested no because we have our own interests and remediator shouldn't shouldn't pursue its own interest it's a different it's i would say it's a different role so our role is to be um to be a strong partner of those two players within the eu um and uh make sure that the eu defines and then projects its its interests in a creative um and not only conflictual way thank you professor mathubani one question for you from the audience um vera phillips would argue that not every country feels free in their decision to join the belt and road initiative and that the signature often comes with a credit treaty offering very favorable conditions we've touched upon this before the question is could the u.s support the eu and other partners pushing forward their own connectivity strategy thereby also promoting their own standards which is one of the crucial aspects of the game i would like to give this question to you and then also to professor nai to answer the question whether the yes and the eu should support and promote their own standards and their own connectivity strategy in the region well i think uh i think we'll be very delighted if the united states and european union came with concrete proposals to build infrastructure to fund it and even to set high standards if they want to do so that would be very very welcome but as you know when the trump administration proposes i forget what it's called clean something being initiative there was no money on the table i mean nothing virtually nothing i mean compared to how much china is prepared to contribute and if you want to be really fair to china let me say something okay if you look at the governance standards of the two big development banks that are in china one is the asian infrastructure investment bank run by jindi chun and then the other one is a new development bank run by brazilian marcus troyo the governance standards of these two development banks are as high as abb world bank and to be honest with you if you want to be very objective they are higher actually better performing banks than the world bank and i and so see this idea that asians can develop higher standards than europeans or americans is inconceivable too many in the west but that's what the asian century is about the asians have actually learned the best practices from europe and from america and are implementing them very well so and if and believe me asia wants to see more of constructive american participation asia wants to see more of european constructive participation but don't lecture please don't come to the asians and say we've you know we'll teach you how to do things we'll tell you what are the highest standards we'll tell you one of the higher ethical standards we'll tell you one of the higher values those days are gone peace you know this is the 21st century you know this is the 21st yeah yeah and you got to get used to a new texture in international relations which is very different yeah where asians may have higher standards than europeans and as demonstrated how by how we took care of profit 19 why scorpio 19 better managing east asia why professor nai do you want to answer this question but i would also like to ask you about the connectivity offer that could be made by the us and europe two countries in the belgian world industry please there are some areas where we in china and other countries can agree on standards there's some areas where we have to be careful about the standards that china's promoting for example at the itu united international telecommunications union china's promoting standards for what you might call the sixth generation which will definitely be not very good for freedom of speech they have a very different view of the internet than europe and america do so in those cases it's important that europe and america do cooperate to make sure that their standards would protect privacy and freedom of speech and there are also some areas where the issue is not standards at all for example uh on the issue of decoupling by not allowing huawei to build the infrastructure for our fifth generation of telecommunications it's a matter of matter of standards it's a matter of security if china controls the 5g telecommunications infrastructure it's a threat to our security and you say well how can we take that view when china doesn't wait a minute 10 years ago china stopped google from participating in the chinese market because of the art of speech approaches of the internet that google represented as a threat to chinese security so in some areas narrowly defined by security there will be and should be decoupling in other areas we're going to have to make sure that the standards that are promoted are standards that protect our values including privacy and freedom of speech so some areas will be cooperation no decoupling other areas they'll have to be decoupling because of security and still other areas we're going to have to negotiate standards we protect our values thank you professor and i there are actually many more questions to answer but our time is unfortunately up and i know since we're in different time zones it's already late in beijing and singapore so i will close this discussion now those of you who still have questions to professor nai can join now a deep dive q and a session with professor nye on our platform you have to be a registered participant on our platform for all the others and for now i would like to thank our panel for this excellent discussion of this topic thank you so much for joining us today and our participants and our live stream viewers for these great questions thank you all very much thank you with this goodbye and we will be back here at the berlin foreign policy forum in 30 minutes for a conversation on the u.s role in the world with samantha power in cooperation with the german marshall fund moderated by karen dunford see you back at 4 p.m at the berlin foreign policy forum thank you and goodbye [Music] you

morning everyone thank you to our witnesses for being here today and i would like everyone to know that this meeting was scheduled before what happened in cuba it's not that i was prophetic it's just that it so happens that is very appropriate to have this hearing today this year entitled historic protests in cuba and the crackdown on free expression will come to order without objection the chair is authorized to declare recess off the committee at any point and all members will have five days to submit statements strenuous materials and questions for the record subject to the length limitations limitation in the rules to insert something into the record please have your staff email previously mentioned address and contact subcommittee staff as a reminder to members joining

after you finish speaking consistent with hr rest eight and the accompany regulations staff are only new members and witnesses witnesses as appropriate when they're not under recognition to eliminate background noise i see that we have a quorum and i now recognize myself for opening remarks what we have witnessed over the last week in cuba is nothing short of historic cubans have taken to the streets by the thousands to call for freedom and democracy they have been clear in demanding an end to the dictatorship it is important to remember that public gatherings are totally prohibited in cuba so every individual who has joined these demonstrations has put their lives on the line they have decided that it is worth it is worth it to risk jail time beatings torture and even death if it means the cuban people might finally have the chance to be free we must not lose sight of just how powerful that is the cuban people are fed up they have had enough of a repressive dictatorship we might stand with them in their quest for freedom i appreciate the statements of strong support we have seen so far from president biden and speaker pelosi i am ready to work with the blind administration to translate those statements into actions we can take actions we can take to provide immediate support to the cuban people we need to work urgently to restore and expand internet access on the island unfortunately there is no silver bullet to solve this problem the regime is effective at confiscating equipment needed for satellite connections and it is adapting and improving its censorship tools with the technical support from the chinese government however i believe we can still do much more to address this issue by working with private companies and civil society to expand internet access to help cubans use the vpn and other circumvention tools another immediate step we should take is to identify and sanction perpetrators of human rights abuses under the maznitsky act doing the con the current crackdown on protesters the cuban state has carried out dozens of documented beatings on journalists and protesters and hundreds of arbitrary arrests we also know of at least one killing at the hands of the estate security and we support their and we and we suspect there are others i believe we should immediately sanction every single official who has committed this severe human rights violation we should also expand our support for those protesting for cuban civil rights society more broadly i have long advocated for u.s assistance to cuba broad democracy organizations we should deepen that support at this critical moment we must remember that there was a human rights crisis in cuba before july 11th there are already 150 political prisoners there were already one 150 political prisoners at the beginning of this month and regime has increasingly targeted artists from the san ysidro movement i call on our allies in europe and latin america to step up and work with us to promote human rights in cuba now is also the time to finally put an end of the cuban doctors program this is a state-sponsored form of human trafficking whereby 50 000 cubans have their passports confiscated their movements restricted and their wages garnish the regime retaliates against their family members if they try to leave the program we saw in venezuela how the cuban doctors were ordered not to provide life-saving medical treatment to people who were not loyal to the manure government this is shameful i am glad secretary blinken highlighted this horrific the terrific program when we launched the state department's trafficking in persons report the united nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery and trafficking in in persons have also denounced these forced labor programs we need countries throughout the world to stand together in saying they will not work with the cuban regime to exploit these doctors anymore i will soon be introducing my legislation to address this important issue and i urge my colleagues to support it i will end on a personal note i fled cuba with my family when i was 11 years old and i remember how the military came to my house and searched my house because they accused my father of hoarding merchandise luckily somebody tipped off the family we came from a very small town and my father was able to take the merchandise and bury it in the backyard so as the military pulled away we're very fortunate somebody tipped us off i also remember the military camera into my house as soon as we filed papers to leave and take inventory of every single item that we owned from the house to the pitcher on the wall and when we receive our exit visa they can back and checked off that every single item in that house was left behind to the cuban government two months later they turned the house to a communist member a party member in the town that my father built it was not a big house it was a very modest house but still you had to turn every single thing that you own to the government before you could leave i have not forgotten that it is because of this repressive regime that i have never i was never able to return to cuba to see my grandmother before she died i have spent every day since i left cuba hoping it would one day become a democracy i hope that this is the beginning of the end of the castro and ds canal dictatorship but what i know for sure is that the cuban people have provided an inspiring example of courage and they deserve our full support thank you and i will now turn to the ranking member mark green for his opening statement thank you chairman uh cirrus and thank you for sharing your personal story as well thanks for holding this hearing and thank you to our witnesses for being here today i especially want to thank miss rosa maria paya rosa maria we applaud your courage in the face of tyranny the the testimony we're about to hear from her is from a courageous individual whose family has been permanently scarred on july 22nd it will be nine years since her father oswaldo paya and his colleague harold sapiro were extrajudicially killed by the cuban regime he was a brave man and regretfully joins the ranks of many others who've died at the hands of the regime and under suspicious circumstances last sunday was a momentous and an inspirational day tens of thousands of cubans all throughout the country took to the streets demanding freedom from the communist dictatorship some even waved the american flag as they demanded libertad since 1959 cuban people have been trapped by the iron grip of fidel castro his brother and its hand-picked successor despite brutal and violent crackdowns from the regime many courageous cubans continue demanding their god-given right to liberty and democracy something three generations and millions of cubans have been deprived of let's be clear this is not about kovid 19 this is not about the embargo what are the cuban people shouting in the streets libertad cubans are sick and tired of being oppressed and they are in the streets openly and bravely demanding an end to communism even prior to these recent protests anti-regime sentiment has steadily increased in the country in november the communist regime broke up a hunger strike led by the san ysidro movement a collective of artists musicians writers and scholars this led to a large protest by hundreds of artists and activists in front of the regime's ministry of culture these protests have been dubbed by some observers as an awakening of civil society in cuba and it sure looks that way a new generation is rising up and they want to live in freedom i am in awe of the courage of the cuban people and the many risks they take protesting the violent and brutal dictatorship we must not ignore the dangers they face an untold number of peaceful protesters and activists remain imprisoned demonstrators risk jail degrading treatment torture even death all for liberty additionally the communist regime uses chinese technology to block and censor internet service and disrupt communications across the island these violations of basic human rights are absolutely unacceptable we must demand action this is a crisis that requires a bipartisan response and chairman serious i know this issue hits home for you and i know you hear as no one else can the cuban people's cries for liberty and dignity holding the communist regime accountable for its repressive policies while supporting the people's quest for freedom and democracy is crucial i hope we can prioritize this issue for the good of all cubans and for the good of the western hemisphere at large the cuban people have never experienced the kind of self-government and freedom that many americans take for granted as the freest and most prosperous nation in the world the united states must unequivocally stand with the cuban people against the communist regime there's a light at the end of the tunnel and cuba has never been closer when will the cuban people finally be free when people of faith are no longer afraid of arbitrary detentions threats and harassment from communist officials that is liberty when artists musicians and writers can freely express express their political opinions in song without fear of retaliation that is liberty when parents don't have to wait hours in line for basic staples like rice and beans just to feed their starving children that is liberty when the dying communist regime breathes its last breath when a sovereign republic takes its place and when separated families are reunited in a free cuba that is liberty mr chairman the people of cuba are looking to the united states for help and guidance i look forward to working with you to answer their cries thank you and i yield thank you very much ranking member green i will now yield to ranking member mccall for his opening statement thank you chairman sierras and ranking member green for your passionate remarks this morning and for holding this important hearing on historic protests that we are seeing in cuba i think this is a pivotal point in history it's a moment in time and we need to take advantage of it since last sunday tens of thousands of brave cubans from all around the country have protested the communist dictatorship that has repressed them for over 60 years and despite being met with brutal violence and censorship they continue risking their lives to fight for freedom and as freedom loving americans we stand with them the people of cuba were promised communism would work they were told to sacrifice their freedoms and ambitions in exchange for a utopia of equality and world-class health care instead the three generations over 60 years have been doomed to misery and shortages as a result of this failed ideology brave cubans have woken up to the lies and propaganda fed to them by fidel castro and his cronies and the world must bear witness and recognize the significance of this historic time and they are protesting the dictatorship waving the greatest symbol of liberty libertad known to man the american flag because they know and the regime knows that america stands for everything that cubans are fighting for freedom liberty and democracy regime thugs are snatching innocent cubans from their homes simply for calling for freedom and we know the venezuelans are in there too with their military as they crack down they knock doors down and take people out of their homes and throw them in prison the idea that a protester will be sentenced to 20 years in prison for simply exercising what we what is sacred in this country it's a right to free speech and they are violently cracking down and violating the religious freedoms and liberties of the cuban people they're also using chinese technology to block and censor internet access from the island and this committee will be working with technologies within the state department to open up those lines of communication we cannot let our adversaries take advantage of the situation and infiltrate our hemisphere in the world is watching and they're watching very closely what we do at this moment in time these human rights violations cannot and will not go unpunished cubans deserve liberty and all that it entails and we must do everything in our power to fight with them for their freedom and that work begins in congress and it begins at the white house i was proud to co-sponsor a bipartisan resolution with my colleagues stating our solidarity with the brave cuban people we must also make sure the administration is doing everything it can to provide uncensored internet access around the country we need to work with the biden administration to lead the international effort for cuban freedom and freedom fighters supporting the democracy leaders and activists on the island simply put we have a moral obligation and a duty to support their aspirations we need our democratic and freedom-loving allies around the world and peace-loving people around the world to stand with the people of cuba to support them against this oppressive regime i want to take this moment to commend our witness rosa marie paya for strength for advocacy almost nine years ago her father was murdered by the cuban regime and we are so sorry miss paya and many others were too and many sit in prison rotting in jails because of this monster and his successors he was internationally known cuban dissident your father and to this day his death has never been properly investigated your family like many others of who dare to speak to the truth to power has paid the ultimate price in your struggle for freedom and i have to say miss pie i admire your bravery i want to thank you for being here today what is happening in cuba is all the proof we need that communism and socialism are bankrupted ideologies that can only lead to utter failure in human misery so in closing as cubans continue to stand up and reject communism and the dictatorship that is doomed three generations of cubans we just say we will stand with them as they bravely fight for freedom cuba libre i yield back thank you ranking member mccall i will now introduce mr jose meyer bivanco who is a leading expert on human rights issues throughout latin america and the caribbean he is an executive director of the americas division at human rights watch mr vivanco previously worked as an attorney for the inter-american commission on

vivanco you are recognized for your testimony thank you mr chair members of the subcommittee thank you for inviting me to testify today on on this very very important matter for human rights in the western hemisphere this hearing couldn't be more timely since july 11th thousands of cubans have taken to the streets across the country in landmark demonstrations protesting long-standing restrictions on rights freedoms scarcity of food and medicines and the government's response to the covet 19 pandemic the cuban government has reacted with brutal repression and censorship since the protest began several organizations have reported country-wide internet bloc and restrictions on social media and messaging platforms human rights groups report that around 500 people have been detained human rights watch has conducted thousands of interviews to con to document the government's response to the protest we have received credible reports of police beatings undocumented multiple cases of arbitrary detention of protesters activists and journalists including many who have been held in comunicado and some whose whereabouts remain unknown people detained include members of the san ysidro and 27 nf movements two coalitions of artists and journalists who have been facing a government crackdown in recent months human rights watch has been continuously documenting abuses against them including arbitrary detention and restrictions of movement and communications victims include people who have performed in or even simply played or promoted motherland and life a song by cuban artists that challenge the cuban government's old slogan motherland or death patria or muerte and criticize the repression in the country we found consistent and repeated patterns in the abuses which strongly suggest a plan by the cuban authorities to systematically repress this independent artist and journalist mr chair and members of the subcommittee even as the cuban government insists on its decades-old repression cuba is changing thousands of cubans are overcoming their fear of the government and despite the government's attempts to restrict communications increase increase access to the internet has enabled many of uh to organize protests and reports on abuses in ways that were virtually impossible only a few years ago at this critical juncture we urge the united states congress and the biden administration to take the necessary steps to dismantle the embargo and abandon the ongoing policy of isolation which has been which have produced no improvements on human rights in the island for too long the u.s embargo has provided the cuban government with an excuse for its problems a pretext for its abuses and a way of to garner sympathy abroad with governments that might otherwise have been willing to condemn the country's repressive practices more vocally rather than isolating cuba the policy has isolated the united states impeding the multilateral and coordinated approach that is needed to press the cuban government to end its repressive policies and practice i urge the u.s congress and the by the administration to take steps towards a new approach in cuba including one progressively dismantling the policy of isolation towards cuba two collaborating with governments in latin america and the european union to ensure a multilateral and coordinated approach three working with these governments to monitor and denounce restrictions on access to internet in cuba cuba is changing and it's past time the u.s policy changes too thank you very much mr chair thank you miss miss payat i now turn to you for your testimony thank you so much mr cher and thank you so much to all the members of of the congress for this opportunity and for your kind words my name is rosa maria paya from the citizen initiative kuala luma to promote human rights our network on the ground have seen explosive growth over the last 16 months my father oswaldo was killing cuba under the orders of the castro brothers on july 22nd 2012. the cuban peoples are in the streets fighting for freedom in at least 45 cities massive protests took place this regime has responded with brutal repression causing countless arrests injuries and death on national tv miguel diaz-canel has called for a war in the streets and to fight using any means in the eastern provinces the police shot on a one protester in the head it is on video the name of the victim is still unknown daniel cardenas was shot inside his home in the city of cardenas his wife was present in some video divis laurencio was shot in the back and killed in lavana it's on video he was 36 years old and his family is now denouncing that official press falsely called him a delinquent videos show people arriving at hospitals badly hurt by police beatings and bullets one shot in the arm another in the leg another in the stomach the victims are workers and students not only members of the organizer position fdp has documented at least 532 detained and missing persons but we estimate that the actual number to be on the thousands the regime has its days numbered and the world is washing in this context to lift the sanctions against the cuban regime is to fund the cuban police and military who oppress the people in the streets obeying top government officials like general raul castro miguel diaz canel general rodriguez lopez general alvarez casas minister of interior general lopez miera minister of the armed force it is a moral imperative to stop the regime abuses after 62 years of crimes against humanity perpetrated by a military dictatorship that has never been held accountable despite the lack of food and medicines the protesters are demanding freedom human rights and democracy they were shouting no more fear change is possible and down with the dictatorship none of them mentioned the u.s embargo but instead homeland and life patrivida the alternative to the castro's slogan of homeland and death to accept the black male of the migratory crisis by the cuban regime is to fail the cuban people we urge the u.s government not to make unilateral concessions to the regime but rather demand the release of all political prisoners and end for the repression and respect for our fundamental freedoms including the legalization of all political parties i would like to share five policy recommendations from the majority of the given civil society on and off the island we humbly ask to the u.s please the u.s should apply individual sanctions making full use of the global waniski act targeting top officials and individuals involved in human rights abuses the us should replicate its approach to the south african appetite and require all companies in relation with cuba to mandatorily embrace the suleiman principles the u.s should take action to break the regime's communication monopoly by enabling independent access to internet to cubans bypassing the censorship of the regime the u.s should invite the european union and the organization of the american states all the members of the organization of the american states to take similar steps and use all available tools including the inter-american treaty of reciprocal assistance to address the threat posed by the cuban regime the regime is illegitimate and should continue to be excluded from the summit of the americas until it complies with the inter-american democratic charter the u.s has the ability to stop the impunity of the regime and protect persons from its brutal repression all options within the international law must be on the table to protect civilians lives in cuba my father said that the american and the cuban people queremos el liberamius we want to be free and we want to be friends thank you for this opportunity and thank you to the american people thank you very much before i begin questions i ask unanimous consent that representatives debbie wasserman schultz val demings nicole milliotakis and scott perry participate at today's hearing after all subcommittee members have had the opportunity to participate and question the witnesses i will now begin questions by recognizing myself for five minutes the state department in 2021 trafficking in persons report reports for cuba maintained the cuba as a tier 3 country in his remarks at the launch of the report secretary of state anthony blinken said that the regime has profited from its exploitive overseas medical missions what are some of the conditions that cuban doctors are subjected to as part of this medical mission and what does the international community need to do to put an end to this exploitation mr vivanco mr chair the cuban doctors deployed in different parts of the world provide a valuable service to many communities in latin america in africa in asia but at the expense of their most basic freedoms that is the price to the point that we believe that the use of these doctors amount to the practice of forced labor the the cuban doctors are subject of draconian rules that violate the right to privacy freedom of expression an association liberty and movement among several other freedoms that are restricted during their missions when you know they are deployed in different communities and the cuban government profit substantively with their service do you have an estimation of how much they profit how much it makes for the island is is quite difficult to get a number for lack of transparency so there are different type of figures out there however we are looking into a very very significant income for the government of cuba and when these doctors are sent to these countries they're sent by themselves families are left behind the families are left behind and they they even uh restrict access to the money that they are supposed to be making until the conclusion of the mission in other words uh the their promise uh payment which is ten times or more what they will be able to earn in their practice as doctors in cuba that is the attraction of course but the way that the cuban government pay them and their family is conditioned to their performance in their communities and to the conclusion of the full program usually after one or two years and if they ask for asylum in the country that they're serving what happens they lose their the the the um uh money that they are supposed to earn um that's why they pay at the end they keep paying some small portions for them to be able to survive in the local in the lo in the community in the local country as well as for the family to to get some you know uh estimate but uh but they might lose all the benefits and their family are not going to be able to leave the country the cuban doctor if if is lucky might get some political asylum in that country but but isolated for who knows how long from their families because he's never going to be able to bring the family to where he has for asylum it will be very very difficult thank you you know during the protest the cuban government shut down internet access in entire areas of the island i know you made some recommendations of what this country can do what can you expand on that yes of course thank you so much um we have known that the united states and and for united states also including private enterprises are able or could have the capacity to provide internet access satellite internet access by passing the censorship of the regime in this moment we ask the united states to move quickly and to enable the cuban citizens with a way of communication that in this moment has the capacity of safe lives now they the reports are there over 50 cities the people turned out were the was the internet shut off in all those cities almost in the in all the islands almost in all the other islands almost in the entire island people started communicating using wi-fi spots through vpns but it was very very difficult to get any access to communication do you know the reaction of the eu to the shutting down of the internet and the people demonstrating on the island well there have been there have been reactions from the european parliament and from the european parliamentarians that have been very very solidarious with the cuban people but i don't know of any response from the european external action service actually in the direction of supporting the cuban people actually they insist in a maintaining a cooperation agreement that includes a political dialogue that has been already violated by the cuban regime which human right clouds have been already violated my time is up thank you very much congressman green thank you mr chairman mr rosa-marie um we often hear that the united states embargo is the primary end is the primary cause of the lack of prosperity and democracy on the island we hear that cuban entrepreneurs would succeed only if they could trade and engage with their american counterparts in previous testimony you informed congress and i quote there cannot be free markets where there are no free persons could you elaborate on that yeah that's actually a phrase of my father and thank you so much for your words about about him and i think that the best answer to your question is coming from the cuban people in the streets they were not asking for the end of the embargo they were asking for the end of the dictatorship at the end of the dictatorship is a demand of the cuban people that's the demand alone and that's the demand that we need solidarity too so just to to make sure i heard you correctly the people that are in the streets protesting they're not protesting and embargo they're protesting the communist regime that's in charge and a dictatorship over there over their country they have been shouting changes possible down with the dictators with the dictatorship no more fear freedom freedom freedom i think that's eloquent enough it is thank you um it's interesting that small french elements uh of the left here are trying to say that it's the embargo but truth be known um it really has nothing to do with the embargo if you look at 90 percent of the companies in cuba they're held by military holding companies meaning the cuban military runs 90 percent of the economy in cuba well there's a law in the united states that says an american company cannot do business with the cuban military so if we lift the embargo we can't even do business with them and where does the money go if 90 percent of the companies are held by the cuban military well it just empowers the dictatorship this insane notion that lifting the embargo is going to somehow provide freedom for the cuban people is crazy it's absurd and the only reason you would say that is unless you're trying to hide behind socialism and communism as an effective model but everywhere else it's been in the world it's been disproved let's look at north korea they can't get rice they're starving remember the ussr in berlin people they built a wall to keep their people in and socialism look at venezuela is not the embargo mr chairman that is causing the people of cuba to suffer under this totalitarian dictatorship and lifting it will only empower them cuba's egregious religious freedom violations are well documented and they are widespread the u.s commission on international religious freedom has called for global magnitsky act sanctions on the head of cuba's office of religious affairs cardio diega for her direct role in leading campaigns of repression against cuba's religious communities can you both share examples of how the regime restricts and penalizes religion in policy and practice sir if we can start with you the exercise of fundamental freedoms in cuba depends on the degree of uh tolerance of of the cuban government there is no rule of law in cuba there is a total concentration of power no independence judiciary the judiciary is under the subordination of the executive branch if the government believe that is uh if i could if i could interrupt you just a second you i think i understood you to say there's no rule of law it's just total power concentrated in the hands of the dictatorship how then i'm going to flip back to my previous question because you supported lifting this embargo how then if the total power is all in the hands of one individual just lifting the embargo free the people i don't understand congressman green in foreign policy you have multiple options if you want to influence if you want to have impact on the record of any given country the option that you have chosen for over or close to 60 years is the isolation that policy has bring no change in cuba i believe i would submit to you right now there's change happening there are thousands of cubans in the streets there's a spotlight on the cuban government the the world is crying for the internet to be open so we can see and see with transparency what's going on we're at a point right now that may just be a great opportunity for two reasons one to show exactly what's going on in cuba under this totalitarian dictatorship happened because of the embargo and two to once again put another head of a communist dictator on the wall and i mean that proverbially for all the uh people who are going to go out there and and say green is espousing some kind of violence i am not i am saying but here's another failed communist regime that's what i think two great opportunities that system doesn't work and we can free the cuban people and unfortunately mr chairman i'm out of time thank you thank you congressman green congressman castro uh thank you chairman and thank you ranking member for organizing this hearing today and before i address my questions to our witnesses i want to reiterate my support most of all for the cuban people i continue to be moved by their plight for their freedoms and their fight for their freedoms their covenant 19 assistance and an end to hunger in their nation and i expressed my solidarity with them especially with those brave cubans who remain disappeared or been imprisoned for standing up for their human rights and for their families and i joined un high commissioner for human rights michelle bachelet in her call to the cuban government to immediately release those arrested during the protests i also think it's necessary for the united states to as president obama said during his visit to havana bury the last remnant of the cold war in the americas and pursue a cuba policy that improves the lives of the cuban people and so i wanted to ask a few questions of our witnesses or actually before i do that i know there's a debate about the embargo and how much that's responsible versus the cuban government and so forth and most of all we support the freedom of the cuban people and their right to choose the leadership of their nation as americans we want to be as helpful to that as possible but in this debate about communism and socialism and so forth our biggest trading partner the united states is a communist country china we have no embargo against china that's our biggest trading partner so i have a question um to miss vivanco thank you for your testimony today and a question that remains after the mass protests across cuba is what the united states government can do to best improve the lives of the people of cuba in this historic speech and diplomatic trip in his historic speech and diplomatic trip to havana president obama discussed at length how the united states embargo and policy of isolation towards cuba was not working saying quote the embargo is outdated and should be lifted so mr vivanco what is the current purpose of the u.s embargo in cuba and how does it help or hurt the cuban people uh congressman castro thank you very much for your question the in my view following human rights conditions in cuba for over 30 years my conclusion is that it's time for the u.s to take a different approach it's the only country in the world that enforce a policy of isolation that policy is rejected unanimously for the rest of the world even conservative governments from europe and latin america has never agreed with the policy of the embargo because imposed indiscriminate sanctions against the people of cuba and is shown to be absolutely ineffective if you want to bring change to cuba and transition from dictatorship to democracy you need to create a multilateral approach a new type of approach to create the right kind of incentives and and and and pressure um uh for the cuban to take those steps cuba is not is not isolated for the rest of from the rest of the world uh tourists from europe canada or any country in latin america uh could spend time money their money they could invest in extractive industries in cuba the only one that is isolated from cuba is the us the only one that is isolated in this debate a global level on the cuban affairs is the u.s why because the policy of isolation uh made the the position of the u.s actually um kind of impotent with regard to the debate on cuba i also wanted to ask you about remittances the ability for folks to send money to cuba you know remittances remittances are vital lifeline to millions of cubans especially the most vulnerable like the elderly and are used to purchase basic necessities like sanitary items and food and even obtaining for obtaining access cards to have access to the internet the trump administration imposed restrictions on remittance remittances and pushed the largest receiver of family remittances in cuba western union to abandon operations on the island unfortunately these harmful policies continue today so i wanted to ask you can you describe how remittances help the most vulnerable of cubans to survive and obtain daily necessities it is absolutely essential to facilitate the um the uh use of remittances the the scent of uh the the the ability of cuban families and friends to send uh money for their their relatives to be able to survive in the country to be able to buy the minutes to use wi-fi and internet which is available in cuba and is one of the vehicles that explain this mobilization in cuba i think is is the right approach to reestablished the ability of q1 families to send money to the relatives in cuba thank you are you back jim thank you congressman castro representative fluger thank you mr chairman and thank you to both of you for your your testimony ms paya thank you for your personal story uh for over 60 years the cuban people have been oppressed by the worst impulses of a brutal regime and failed promises of communist propaganda and what we're seeing today is those people saying enough is enough we must stand with them and finally rid the western hemisphere of this hegemon of oppression and unfortunately the biden administration is sending very dangerous and mixed signals through both policy and rhetoric to those that wish to flee this brutal regime that if you're fleeing a communist regime where defectors are silenced or shot and everyday citizens are starving to death you're not welcome in america this is the message that secretary mayorkas who himself was born in havana gave last week when he remarked that cuban refugees attempting to flee by the sea will not be permitted in the united states this message is echoed again by acting assistant secretary at state department when he remarked that the protests were peaceful and rooted only in concerns about rising covet cases and medicine shortages this is false the cuban people as you've mentioned are shouting libertad they're waving the american flag they're standing for freedom they're not shouting down with an embargo and while our administration downplays the severity of the crisis in cuba and pledges to turn away cuban refugees president biden is simultaneously thrown open the southern borders to cartels coyotes and others meanwhile the administration advocating for socialist policies right here in the united states when we see massive government control over society simply does not work cuba is showing us in real time and the world how quickly communism collapses and and leads to a spiral of deadly conditions of poverty starvation and hopelessness causing enough desperation that right now cubans are staring down the oppressors in the streets and risking their lives to cross treacherous waters on homemade rafts to reach the shores of liberty the symbol of freedom the united states of america the united states remains the beacon of freedom and democracy around the world and we must do everything within our power to support those who are valiantly standing for liberty and we must do it right here at home there have been a chorus of this very body right here in congress supporting the cuban people in their efforts and i certainly support that effort as well and instead of throwing our doors open to human traffickers on our southern border president biden must take decisive action to bolster the pro-democracy movement and support the brave cubans who are fighting in their own streets for liberty ms paya how important is it to have freedom of speech what does it mean to have freedom of speech thank you so much it is it is fundamental and is is the is the root of what of what is going on in cuba the the people of cuba often haven't waited for the cuban regime to authorize them to speak they are shouting freedom in the streets and if i if i make a a call and request for all of you is to please to listen to what the cuban people is demanding on the street at the highest possible risk which is alive they are demanding freedom they aren't demanding the end of the dictatorship please do not politicize that it's not about politics it's not it's not about right and left it's about the main and contradiction that the cubans have experienced which is not the embargo or any other contradiction between the military dictatorship and any other country is the main contradiction the root of the suffering of the cuban people is the conflict between a group of militaries that have health power in a legitimate way for more than 62 years and a whole population that needs demanding exchange that is demanding a transition process that is demanding democracy and that now the united states and the rest of the world have the opportunity and the challenge to take sides with the cuban people to help accountable help the cuban people to hell accountable that regime and to bring about freedom in cuba that also means democratic stability and also means getting rid of one of the threats that the national security of this country has in this hemisphere thank you for that and i just want to go back to one of the remarks that you made that you said that lifting sanctions is basically funding terrorism it's funding the dictatorship to do what they want through military action and i appreciate your comments on that mr chairman i know i'm out of time thank you again for holding this hearing i yield back thank you very much congressman andy levin you're on thanks so much to the chairman and ranking member for holding this uh really important hearing this morning uh you know one of the subjects of the protests has been access to covet vaccines in my view this is an area where the u.s might be able to actually heed the cuban people's call but it's my understanding that sending vaccines to cuba would require a special license at least from the department of commerce and perhaps also treasury last week ricardo guerrero executive director of the cuba study group tweeted everyone trying right now to coordinate aid to the cuban people is running into a morass of ofac and commerce shipping and banking restrictions this is how current u.s policy doesn't help mr ivanko do you believe that current sanctions uh and the current sanctions regime makes the delivery of humanitarian aid to the cuban people more difficult indeed indeed i believe that um the the measures that the uh biden administration and this congress could take to facilitate access to um medicine and um and and vaccine even to alleviate these painful times of the cuban people who have no access to vaccine i believe also that the cuban government has been reluctant to accept accept vaccines from russia and china for dogmatic reasons uh they are they were hoping to develop their own vaccine right and um and and if uh if the u.s government could uh help and provide some um relief for the cuban people with access to vaccine i think will be terrific and it would really have a big impact on our relationship directly with the people right exactly yes and you know given the crackdowns that we've seen on the protesters horrible crackdowns it seems that the kind of sanctions that we're talking about here that kinds that are not targeted have not prompted the government to improve its human rights record would you agree i agree 100 percent so what tell us in your view what do you think the best approach would be for the for us to influence the cuban government on its human rights record something you've devoted your career to including the crackdowns on protesters if we want to get away from ideology and talking points and actually help improve the human rights record there what should we do actually congressman levin i do believe that the best way to support the dictatorship is keep the status cool in other words change nothing insist on a policy that has failed the policy of isolation the policy of sanctions has bring no improvement on human rights in in cuba my sense is that the u.s foreign policy toward cuba is not inspired on the need to improve human rights and democracy in cuba it's just a policy that reflects the preferences of the electorate in florida and has nothing to do with the goal to improve human rights in in cuba so but do you think there are things we can do and what are they because i'm with you i agree with you but what should we do what you should you know try to do especially now that you have the majority in the house is to take the necessary steps to at least open up a debate about the lack of effectiveness of a policy of isolation toward cuba and to empirically empirically how established whether there is any other democracy in the world that is has been willing to join forces with the u.s in the policy of isolation you will conclude that the rest of the world every year systematically condemn that policy and only israel and the us support the policy of isolation on cuba so if you could take internal steps to at least open up a debate about the lack of effectiveness the impotence of the us government in affecting or cuban human rights conditions in cuba i think that would be very very helpful well thanks you know obviously there's strong policy disagreements on this subject but i think we all agree on our commitment to the cuban people and their well-being and i hope that in the interest of that commitment we're able to have a nuanced and honest conversation about what policies are helpful and which are harmful and you're making a very strong case that we've been beating our heads against the wall for 60 years not helping the human rights situation in cuba so we've we really have to find a more effective way and with that mr chairman i yield back thank you congressman congresswoman salisa thank you mr chairman and thank you jose miguel ivanko for being here rosa maria and your family paid the highest sacrifice your father oswald stood up for a free cuba that is something that the castro regime fears they killed him and they covered it up saying that it was a car crash so that we will never know the truth i met him twice when i was a news reporter and he was the epitome of decency i can say that and i'm glad that you're here today because of your bravery and your commitment to his memory after a week of silence now the biden administration is saying they're going to reveal the effect of their remittances that is very embarrassing it's a slap in the face to you to your father to all the cuban people and to us the elected officials who were not informed or consulted the people of cuba as we have said they are not shouting embargo no more we want more remittances they're shouting libertad the bare minimum the biden administration could do is to connect the inter the internet because that way the world will be able to know and see the truth and they can communicate among themselves they will also know that they are not alone and that the united states is with them the biden administration could hence could enhance the wi-fi from havana embassy or from guantanamo and this can be done in minutes also the private sector has developed these balloons that can carry y5 directly to the island i'm going to uh say this message in spanish directamente pueblo cubanova series of now my question is i'm going to if i have more time i'm going to ask you questions but i would like to talk to mr vivanco and ask you a simple question i was a news reporter and i saw when obama lifted all restrictions for two and a half years he gave the opportunity to the cuban government to really join the international community and they spit on obama two years dozens of american companies wanted to do business in cuba and the casters did not allow them madonna went to celebrate her birthday and the while the damas de blancos were being beaten on the streets mick jagger went to do a big concert i interviewed dozens of american companies who wanted to do business with the cuban government and during the obama years the cubans said no no i don't know let me see because they are in the business of power so when you are telling me mr ivanko and you have a fantastic organization that you represent looking out for human rights when you tell me the embargo is the is the solution obama proved it and they spit on him which was lamentable so why do we have to live the embargo please i never say that the embargo is a solution i say that the embargo is the problem it's not the solution and uh if you want to do you mean by that well because you know and and and secondly um uh congressman uh congresswoman salazar um the part of the problem is the perception the notion that uh that there is some sort of quick pro-quo relationship with the cuban government the cuban government i don't think is interested in lifting the embargo i think the embargo helped the cuban government to keep that notion that narrative that they are victims of the us government but they if the united states wants to do business and the american companies want to do business in cuba if the if the cheering doesn't let them it doesn't matter if there is an embargo or not they just simply cannot go home depot or sheraton what you need is to create the conditions for the international community for the rest of democracies in the world obama created it sir or didn't he right no but but what you you need is to create the conditions for democracies in latin america and europe to join support for human rights in cuba they are not crossing that line because the policy of isolation that they obama lifted the policy of isolation for two and a half years and the castro regime did not respond i don't think they gave everything in exchange of nothing let's look at the empirical evidence obama allowed for any american company to go and invest in cuba whether it was construction hotel hospitality and they and the cubans did not sign the contract there was a ferry i remember i was there i was a news reporter a ferry that wanted to go from key west to havana the cubans never allowed it so what are you i just would like to understand your position so maybe i can support it but i don't see it because history proved it already with president obama so now if you lift the embargo what's going to happen is the chinese model and the chinese model is the worst thing that could happen to the cuban thank you congresswoman in the second round you'll be able to continue your questioning thank you sorry david wasserman schultz was recognized thank you mr chairman and i thank the gentleman for his indulgence in waiving on uh allowing us to wave on to the committee i had a chance to watch the subcommittee proceedings remotely as a couple of things i think it's important to point out first is that president biden has proposed additional sanctions and left the sanctions from the previous administration in place he's declared himself in his own voice cuba as a failed state he gave voice to the cuban protesters issuing a clarion call for freedom and he has stood solidly since the protests broke out and before that in support of a free cuba i also think and ms ms pava i i really want to um agree with you about how important it is that this issue be nonpartisan not bipartisan but nonpartisan so you'll forgive me if i defend a few things prior to going back to what should be a nonpartisan issue i really think the the audacity of those in the republican party who widely across this country support voter suppression and have supported the suppression and the and thrown obstacles in the path of people across this country who simply want to cast their lawful and constitutional right to vote and who have denied that january 6th was an insurrection have a lot of nerves suggesting that they are the the champions of freedom in another country when they are engaging in suppression of the people's right to vote and freedom here okay so setting aside that partisan that that partisan uh moment for a second i want to ask ms paya if you could talk with me about afro-cuban the afro-cuban environment which i think is so under-reported and so few people are aware of according to the university of pennsylvania's professor amalia dashe almost 70 percent of the cuban population is of african descent let that sink in for a moment the state department's 2020 human rights report suggests that cubans of african descent suffer significant racial discrimination including subjection to racial slurs and beatings by security agents in response to the political activity many have also reported employment discrimination particularly for positions of prominence within the tourism industry media and government despite this afro-cubans have historically been at the forefront of the fight for cuba's democracy and freedom even though there has been a significant erasure of afro-cubans from history can you share with us the specific challenges or threats that afro-cubans cuban activists face on the island and how is the economic crisis in cuba and the covet-19 pandemic disproportionately affected afro-cubans yeah thank you thank you so much for that question because actually afrocubans are also the largest population in jail are also the largest population with access with with a with families that comes from a situation of vulnerability and also uh within the given opposition the given civil society we have seen it with uh with uh with all the actions that a momentous anger has made have been also one of the most affected and targeted by by the cuban regime it was already a challenge one week ago to be a of african descent and walk by the streets of havana without actually being asked for the id to just to to to check if actually he was a havanen or he needed to be deported to the eastern provinces that's what cubans of african descent actually endure you know in in our in our in our country and and and i i think it's a very important and relevant point because this is widely ignored or not commenting on about the race systems of the character of this communist regime that have been that have been using its propaganda as a machinery actually to get to um human rights defenders around the world when they are actually trying to suppress tribes may i just interrupt you for a moment and just ask you to confirm you know while the cuban cuba regime has declared uh racism ended you know after the the revolution isn't it true that they have completely banned and prohibit prohibited any african or black activism organization from existing and functioning on the island they have prohibited any independent organization asking for a for rights of cubans of african descent yes that's absolutely true thank you thank you of course of course of course they have entitled themselves of the defenders of those rights right the irony um mr chairman thank you for your indulgence and i just also want to point out that i myself have been a long time opponent of lifting the embargo i yield back the balance of my time which i no longer have thank you congresswoman congressman perry you're recognized for five minutes mr chairman with all due respect i'm you seed in here as far as i know and i appreciate it but i think my the good representative from new york should be next and it goes by seniority i'm happy to defer you're older no i can go i can go you want to defer to her yeah i think it'd be appropriate yeah but before how i had demings why don't you just go and we'll take care of this no congressman perry all right all right thanks mr chairman well i appreciate the opportunity to speak before this uh subcommittee regarding what i think is the evil dictatorial regime of the cuban communist party and i'll be clear about that before i continue i want to pay tribute to one of our witnesses here today rosa maria paya and thank you for all the work that you've done to give the cuban people a democratic voice i know i speak for everyone on this committee in condemning the despicable murder of your father oswaldo at the hands of the castro regime nearly nine years ago on july 22nd it is long past time for an independent investigation to be commissioned into mr pius death you have our word and our commitment that we will do everything we can to bring this grotesque regime to account for its numerous crimes against humanity those who have lived through the evils of the cuban regime could tell us with little regard the castros have for the dignity and the worth of every human life and we know that they sadistically tore apart families imprisoned and killed thousands of political dissidents supported groups like the farc and uh sendero luminisso who we who decapitated people live on television and destroyed cuba's economy i recall november 2016 when the far-left apologists like canadian prime minister justin trudeau insisted that cuba under castro was actually a progressive egalitarian utopia i could only shake my head at the stomach churning ignorance of a prominent head of state this is this is unacceptable at any level at every level what most folks don't know is that compared with the average monthly income of approximately twenty dollars for a cuban citizen fidel castro boasted a 900 million dollar net worth of worth in 2006 900 million dollars egalitarian is certainly not a word i would use to describe cuba under castro castro also sent doctors abroad on so-called humanitarian missions to bolster bolster his own finances all while the hospitals in cuba remain chronically under-supplied and even lacked such basic products as aspirin and blanket blankets the castros are both self-serving tyrants and their puppet successor mr diaz canel is cut from the same oppressor's communist cloth you'll hear from apologists that exact that excessively long wait times at cuban hospitals food and medicine shortages and lack of economic opportunity is entirely the fault of the american embargo couldn't be further from the truth the embargo is the only reason cuba isn't thriving economically they'll say what these apologists won't tell you is that cuba trades extensively with almost every country in the rest of the world the u.s embargo doesn't prevent cuba from trading with other countries or non-american companies indeed cuba trades extensively with china spain venezuela and russia gross mismanagement and dictatorial policies are to blame for cuba's current state not the embargo and in true fashion it is the little people in cuba it is the average citizen that suffers under socialism under communism under this dictatorship and is the people at the top that thrive and and just as an aside that's what some of the people in this government in the united states of america want to bring to america today we are thankfully able to bear witness to the tenacity and character of the cuban people as they rise up to tell their evil government that they've had enough freedom has been subverted for generations in cuba but not for one day longer if the cuban people have anything to say about it i wish to iterate a word of caution to my colleagues we must not undermine the efforts of cuba's pro-democracy anti-socialist movement while the cuban people languished under the progressive castro regime former president obama re-engaged the wetfoot dry foot policy for the cuban people in retaliation for cuban-americans voting overwhelmingly republican in the 2016 election we can only hope that president biden has choose such atrocious and blatantly obvious political retribution and instead commits the full resources of the united states government to benefit those yearning to be freed from tyranny 90 miles away from our shores now miss paya can you tell us how internet access would bolster the pro-democracy movement in cuba right now and what americans can do right now to make sure that happens thank you so much actually it has already done that they very censor it and and scars internet access existing in cuba has already give an empowerment to it to the cuban people and now there are more cubans that actually know in three hours that last sunday just in three hours the protests replicated around the whole island three hours after there was no internet at all in the island or or it was uh it was almost a cutted completely so yes to give internet access uh in satellite internet access with the capacity of bypassing the censorship or just been out of control of the of the kievan regime has the possibility now also to save lives because we are going to be able to for instance verify all the atrocities that we haven't been able actually to put in numbers and a and to put in the reports to the inter-american commission of human rights or to the um of or to the u.n because we have no communication we have no connections and and that connection and that freedom of speech speech that we were just talking um previously is the only tool that the cuban people have right now that and their own bodies and they are putting those bodies on the streets and they are demanding freedom and the end of the dictatorship if i may i want to mention that last year we collect 45 tons of food and medicine as humanitarian aid and we sent it to the island without any obstacle from the american government or institution the only obstacle was the cuban regime that confiscated all that humanitarian aid and actually they just stole it thank you i thank the chair and the ranking member total committee's indulgence congressman demings congresswoman apologies thank you so much mr chairman and thank you to you and the ranking member for allowing me to participate in today's very important hearing of the testimony and responses to our questions have been powerful and i believe they are so necessary to our understanding of the dictatorial communist and social socialist regime in cuba on july 11 and since cubans have bravely told us what they want for their future and that's freedom let's be clear about that we as a nation know or we should know that people are willing to sacrifice everything to be beaten to be in prison to even die for the sweet taste of freedom and we as a nation have another opportunity yet another opportunity to get this right and i am hoping that we will stay focused on freedom and not the destructive politics of the day i too am specifically interested first of all on the unique challenges that afro-cubans face my colleague did ask about that but mr vivanco i'd love to hear your thoughts on the unique and specific challenges that afro-cubans face um yes the afro afro-cuban community is is large in cuba and has been historically discriminated in spite of the official line that cuba is not uh i mean it's a racial democracy it's not we know that it's not a democracy we know that it's a dictatorship and uh and we know that they discriminate uh against those ones uh who comes from the afro uh cuban community and um and and and you see that one as uh rosa maria paya said on the streets uh in in control police control and as well as um in the um in the prisons in the cuban prisons um cuban's access to uh afric afro afro-cuban access to education and as well as the top positions within the dictatorship thank you so much and i'd also like to ask about cuban lgbtq right activists who were arrested and beaten by plainclothes security officers in may of 2019 for organizing an unauthorized demonstration after government officials had cancelled a plane a planned annual march against homophobia how would you evaluate current legal protections for lgbtq individuals in cuba and the level of societal discrimination against them as well as my colleague rosa maria paya said everything depends on cuba and whether you are independent or you are part of the official machinery so an lgbtq organization that that try to develop their own approach their own policies and they're trying to make an effort to for instance to monitor human rights conditions for their own community are not allowed are prohibited and are subject of all sort of you know sanctions and persecution in cuba unless you are part of the official structure it's paya anything you'd like to add there yes i think it was very very well established and unaccurate and uh if i if i just ask there are many members of the lgbt community and many cubans of african descent within the opposition movement and and and they and the cuban civil society we give as we understand that that all of us we need the fundamental human rights but i need to say that those that are members of the lgbt community or the archives of african descent have an extra challenge when they have to face the repression of the of the of the given estate security and just briefly mention the case of hector louis descossio actually he he's a cuban of african descent and he's a member of lgtv community and he was almost raped during arbitrary detention a few days ago thank you both so very much for your testimony uh mr chairman i do yield back thank you for participating congresswoman nicole malintoshakis thank you thank you chairman despite my greek last name many of you may not know that i'm of cuban descent my mom is a cuban refugee my grandfather had his gas stations and small business home taken away from him by this regime i still have family that are living there and i could just say that this because i've heard one of my colleagues earlier talk about covet vaccinations that is the least of their problems okay nobody needs covavec they need them perhaps but it's not it's not the issue and that is not what they're fighting for they want freedom they are starving they need access to medicine they don't have any of these things because the regime takes it all and with regards to the embargo you know i i i very much disagree with you mr vanco because cuba does business with nearly every other country in the world hundreds 100 at least 100 billion dollars in trade annually for that small island the regime takes everything the regime takes everything anything that comes into this island whether it's money whether it's food whether it's medicine the regime takes it and lifting the embargo will do nothing except prop this communist regime this murderous brutal communist regime which you understand as someone who is an advocate for human rights further up it will do nothing to actually help the people and so my question is first to someone who truly understands as a dissident herself miss paya can you please explain to my colleagues how this regime weaponizes anything that comes into this island against their own people yes thank you thank you so much for that question because one of the things that the regime weaponized are actually human beings cubans and i think that everybody here already understand that the cuban regime can be thinking on blackmailing united states with a migratory with a migratory crisis to be a to to to get into that trap in this moment is is to fail the cuban people the root of the problem the root of the problem is that dictatorship and the given people understand that and that's why they are they are demanding the um the end of the dictatorship regarding all the sins that are sent to the island i have to say we want to send everything to the island but under the condition of no interference of the given regime and that condition is just because when the regime interferes that sense a hard currency or humanitarian assistance or whatever it is doesn't end in the hands of the cuban people but in the hands of the repressors so it's very important it's very important that this country help us not to give money to the repressors but to help but to help the cuban but to help the cuban people uh i if i if i may uh to make this discussion about the embargo is to take the old approach the cuban people is in the streets something's changed in july and in july 11 a week ago the people is in the whole island demanding freedom demanding the end the end of the dictatorship and there are many sins many new scenes many fresh scenes that this administration that the members of the ois that the european union could do and should do to help that people and i will repeat please target individual sanctions rise the cost of the repression targeted the targeting the individuals the generals that are commanding those those those killings and those detentions replicate the south african experience when we say please put consequences to the enterprises that actually enrich the the regime we're not asking for any extraordinary we're asking for the suleiman principles the same experience that actually work to end the upper tide why we cannot have that in cuba now when the cuban people is demanding that thank you very much so uh yes the communist regime if you are one of them one of the communists if you join their cube their communist revolution then you will be taken care of somewhat by despite what's coming into this island if you are someone who is a dissident or just an average cuban you get absolutely nothing that is that is the false promise of communism that everything would be equal right that's what socialism claims we want equality yet it couldn't be further from the truth the dictators the ruling class live like kings and everyone else lives in squalor and that is what we're trying to the end um and by pushing for freedom on this island and allowing them to determine their own future uh mr vivenka i will though ask you a question because someone who is involved in human rights watch i would love to know your opinion about cuba along with china and russia and venezuela the most egregious human rights violators being members of the united nates united nations human rights council um i do i have a second to answer your question sure look um a couple of points i'm not in disagreement with you on the first point that when you mentioned that cuba is not isolated i fully agree with you that is precisely the problem you have failed to persuade the rest of the international community that you have to isolate cuba cuba is not isolated is trading with you know with any other country including brazil brazil is the the most important source of food for for cuba and um so the trouble is that you are insisting on a policy that create fundamental disagreement for the rest of the international community and the challenge for me is to create conditions to bring in those democracies to exercise pressure on the cuban government but the line of the of the uh isolation and the embargo is not supported for the by the rest of the world that is essentially the problem that you have here it's a pragmatic problem you need to look at this one with different eyes to see what could be what would be the most effective policy from the us to improve human rights conditions to force that dictatorship to transit from dictatorship to democracy and certainly the approach that you know that the u.s has taken for 60 years is not working that is my point and we're doing business with everybody in the world and it's not working but if you're going through my human rights we're going to have second second round thank you very much i'm going to ask a second round a question if you don't mind and i'll start by saying this i am so happy that you congresswoman congresswoman demings raised the afro-cuban situation in cuba because for many years the propaganda machine in cuba has told the world how in cuba there is no racism that the afro-cuban is equal to the white cubans i mean this propaganda machine it's incredible throughout the world because i have traveled extensively and people tell me i said that's nothing that's not accurate you know just you know just like they have five vaccines in cuba well why don't they use them just like when they say they discovered oil off the island of cuba well how many barrels have they extracted you know it made the whole east coast of of this country in a panic thinking that they were going to have drilling 90 miles from so the propaganda machine in cuba it's the best in the world so i'm so happy that you touched upon that point that it's a lie about how equal the society in cuba is and as far as the vaccine i am all for sending vaccines to cuba my problem is that what you're going to have is the same situation you had in venezuela we sent vaccines to venezuela and the government takes it so it doesn't get to the people it just gets to the people who support this dictatorship so how do you get around that uh mr vivanco how do you get around the government taking everything you send to the island to to help ease the situation on the island when the government is is just a taker mr chair the best vehicle to address that challenge is to do it through united nations united nations when they when they come into humanitarian uh crisis like the one facing in uh in venezuela one of the fundamental preconditions is that the distribution access um and and administration of all the food or medicine is done uh under the u.n flag not the local one because it's obviously the the um the temptation for the dictatorship in venezuela as well as in cuba is to take advantage of that one and to uh you know to take advantage to do some more propaganda by using that that type of uh support so i don't see a way that the uh u.s government even divided administration could provide access to uh or support for vaccine vaccination of the cuban people without doing through some sort of vehicle like the un uh who has the capacity and the know-how to make those distributions according to u.n principles which are which are you know by definition non-political in terms of the five vaccines that the cuban claims they have the abdallah and the other ones vaccines why don't they use it the the part of the problem is that the the way that they have handled the covet uh epidemic in in in cuba has been a disaster as i said before our information revealed that they have rejected vaccines coming from china and russia just because they want to prove and to demonstrate to their own people and the rest of the world that they have the capacity to produce their own vaccine and then distribute that one to the rest of the world well all of that you know plan has failed and it's part of another piece of propaganda would you like to add something to that yeah i just asked that that actually the given regime also rejected the kova's er help kovacs is an initiative of um or in relation with um and they also rejected the covert flaxseed in a very criminal decision not to immunize the cuban the cuban population and and provoke and an even deeper crisis that the one that we were already that we were already facing uh whether it is a united nations or the european union or any other multilateral organization the key scene is the non-intervention of the cuban regime as soon as they participate in the process they they are going to um they are going to solve this the the hope or they are going to weaponize that help against the given people thank you congressman green thank you mr chairman and thank you for the witnesses for willing to do a second round one of my colleagues earlier commented that china was a good example where the u.s has no embargo and inferred that because of that uh it's proof a reason why we should lift the embargo with uh with cuba i'd encourage those who are supporting lifting the embargo and citing china as proof to go and watch the video of the protesters in hong kong go ask the uyghurs what it's like to live in china under the communist party of china i'd like to ask you to go and talk to the churches in china where they're forcing them to take the cross down and replace it with pictures of xi jinping the only other place in the world i can recall in my limited travels as a military officer and and in running a not-for-profit is that where the president's picture is so ubiquitous as saddam hussein in iraq go ask the fulangong folks what it's like to have your organs forcibly removed and sold i don't see the lifting of the embargo making a huge change there in china ask the student or the researcher how easy is it to search the internet in china they don't call it the great firewall of china for nothing so this notion that i mean lifting the embargo is going to make totalitarian dictatorships change overnight is just it it pales um i'm an er physician not a brain surgeon so perhaps maybe there's something i don't know but i've looked i'm sitting here thinking uh totalitarian dictators in the past how many of them with opened economic have actually stepped down from power and allowed for a republic to develop i can't think of one in history question from miss paya there's strong international consensus for restoring venezuela's democracy and people are working together uh countries are supporting us and our you know actions there yet in cuba as mr vivian vavanco yep has said they are doing in cuba i mean we haven't gotten others to join us there what what is the difference and this is just a genuine question what is the difference and why are why are they not uh helping with cuba but they seem to be very helpful with venezuela and the socialist dictator down there well i i think that's a question for for the rest of the world because what what it is a a reality is that tolerating 62 years of a communist dictatorship in the island of cuba hasn't all only affected several generations in in my country but has greatly and seriously affected the democratic stability of the whole continent actually we wouldn't be talking about the collapse of the democracy in venezuela without the support the coordination and the interference of the cuban regime same thing with the with the repression in nicaragua and uh and and you know history you know about the interference uh programs of the cuban g2 well trained by the estacion and the kgb in in in latin america so this in in this in this pivotal moment that we are living as a nation a nation that lives inside but also outside the island because of that dictatorship our call for the international community is please see directly to the cuban people to the suffering of the given people and to the demand of the cuban people and that demand is freedom and that demand is the end of the dictatorship and that demand is not only going to help cuba but it's going to help peace and national security of our host hemisphere throughout the region absolutely it seems to boggle the mind that we'll we'll be we'll the world will join us to jump on venezuela but the folks that are actually the i mean the cuban military is in venezuela the the cuban military is helping nicaragua yes i mean it just makes no sense to me that the rest of the world is uh has joined us in this fight and yet that seems to be the reason why it's failed because we haven't gotten all the rest of the world involved so let's just lift the sanctions makes no sense to me thank you thank you congressman green congressman vargas thank you for coming mr chairman thank you very much and thank you for allowing me to be here i apologize i had a committee running at the same time as this one um the only thing i would correct for the record may be that dr green said i'm not sure that a er physician would yield to a brain surgeon in every instance maybe in this case but point taken but that being said that great concern for what's going on obviously in cuba i'd like to see the dictatorship gone the authoritarian rule and obviously have democracy and have people have the opportunity to vote and to choose whomever they want that they haven't had that opportunity i'd like to see the cuban people be able to lift their standard of living obviously cuban americans when they come to the united states they do very very well and i'm sure that that country would be able to lift up its standard of living if it had freedom if it had democracy um but a lot of people ask in a practical sense what can we do to really help i mean are they short of sending the marines i mean how in a practical sense can we help cuba in this moment um why don't i begin with you uh mr ivanko what we need is the support of the internet the rest of the international community bringing change on cuba and uh improving uh the record of cuba and human rights and democracy without the support of western democracies european democracies canada latin american democracies is going to be difficult has been very very difficult and um normally when you raise questions about cuba to to a head of a state in any western democracy they will ask you what about the embargo that is the problem it becomes a distraction and they say you know we are not going to join forces this has been told to me many times because i care about cuba and i travel the world raising questions about cuba or venezuela so when you say you know what about those uh you know free speech in cuba freedom of religion in cuba freedom association you know that uh we have never heard about a strike in cuba why there are no strikes in cuba because they're not independent unions in cuba are not allowed so when you try to create a debate outside the u.s in mexico for instance which is has a lot of influence in cuba the natural reaction of those ones who should be supporting human rights in cuba is what about the embargo we don't support the embargo and then you try to divide the conversation and say you know let's discuss the embargo later let's focus on cuba now you know and and and the rest of the world is not willing to make that let me interrupt you just for one second thank you for that answer i mean a lot of people believed including myself maybe there was going to be an opening when the soviet union imploded when the soviet union plotted a lot of us thought well this is a satellite state really of the soviet union and there's going to be change in cuba but it didn't really happen because they continue to have support from other countries around the globe and they continue to have it so in a practical sense when you say that western democracy should kick in i think they should but if they do how will that really make a difference if they're getting support from these other countries if cuba is getting support from other countries of course they don't like us very much it still seems like they will carry on i mean that that's what people want to know how in a practical sense can we make a difference with the reality on the ground there in the international reality as it is how can we make a difference the only look i i sound like a broken wrecker but the best way to contribute constructively to the cuban debate is by looking into your own policy and make a very objective empirical assessment of the whether that policy has been effective or has failed my conclusion is has failed because you know you have a very strong dictatorship in place so it's time to introduce some adjustments former president obama didn't lift the policy of isolation what he did was to reestablish diplomatic relations with cuba but the heavy lifting the work needs to be done here in congress if this if this policy is not subject of a real and serious objective non-partisan you know evaluation we will keep this tattoo cool and i bet you that nothing will change in cuba thank you i have more questions about my time's up so i will yield thank you thank you congressman congresswoman salisa thank you very much mr chairman i have a couple of questions for both of you let me start with you rosa maria um basically yes or no if the white house gives green light to connect internet either through guantanamo or raven company or the us embassy in the middle of el manacon will the cubans go back into the streets the givens are already in the streets but more and more of course of course i mean that that connection allows communication and allows and allows coordination do you think that that more cubans will feel emboldened because they know that the world is watching them because of the wi-fi that's very important that's key i i do think that and i do think that everybody needs to send the message to the cuban people that they are not alone but if the biden administration is not saying clearly that that they are with that the biden administration of the united states government is with the cuban people are they receiving that information uh the the best way to be with the given people is with real actions and internet is one of them right now um what else can we do besides forcing the biden administration to give the green light so we can turn on the internet right now which is the most effective manner through the embassy or in guantanamo with a tower yf tower we're not talking about netflix quality video we're talking about just the ability to lift the vid the videos that show how they're being beaten on the streets what else could we do besides that you could please help us to to put these recommendations on the rather of the of the of the president and and please uh also do it as not just personal recommendations but actually these are the suggestions the recommendations of the majority of the cuban civil society on a position that took part of a platform called a pasos de cambio and unfortunately the biden administration is not paying attention to us or to the cuban people which is the most important part so then i go to mr ivanko where are you saying you're saying i've been hearing you repeat once once and uh and many times that um that we need the international community to join the united states in order to create change in cuba but then my question is now putting the embargo aside putting politics aside where is the international community now when they see that the people are shouting on the streets that has nothing to do with the americans or with the embargo where is that international community unfortunately the reaction of the international community is not um you know um up to the the level and why is that it's required why is that what do you think that is because um um unfortunately uh let me give you let me excite you an example the president the current president of argentina okay yes he says i have no idea what is going on in cuba but i am against the embargo so that is very unfortunate reaction and he is the leader of a democratic country it's not a dictatorship this is not uh you know we are not looking into russia or china is a one of the biggest democracies in latin america and uh and he you know he he seems to be uh you know somebody who should be uh aware about what is going on everything is the embargo but then if you're telling me that he doesn't even know what's happening in cuba uh so that means that they don't care what's happening and like repeat what's happening cuba has nothing to do with the embargo but then and i want you to tell me where i'm wrong in this statement you lift the embargo as you are advocating the united states to do then the castro brothers will have access to loans specifically from the world bank and from the imf and everybody will be doing business with cuba because there is no more american embargo on it right and then um then what happens then accordingly for i go back to obama then what happens next we will then have given oxygen to a repressive apparatus to continue repressing the cubans and then where is the democracy in this whole picture let me let me answer your question and i think it's also relevant for uh the comment that made by congressman greene he said and i believe and i agree with you congressman green he's you said uh i don't believe that lifting the embargo will bring change and democracy overnight in cuba so then we have to wait what 50 years i agree 100 i agree 100 so in other words this is not a trickle-downs economic it's not like uh you lift the embargo then bingo you have democracy in cuba the following day what you need is a multilateral pressure and you need to build that one and that will take time to build up you know diplomacy with democracies in the world that depends on those democracies and i agree that depends on those democracies and you just pointed out the fact that those democracies are just not tuned in so we do not if they will at some point so one way or the other we do not know when democracy is going to get to cuba but in the meantime this the cubans are on the street and no one is paying attention including the biden administration that's right thank you congresswoman sorry congratulations thank you for the time thank you so much mr chairman um i'd like to uh to turn to the subject of cuban doctors and just reference a march 2019 report by the new york times that detailed how members of cuba's medical mission in venezuela said that they were told to provide oxygen tanks and other desperately needed medical assistants only to individuals who committed to voting for the maduro regime in multiple cases they described it being ordered to withhold life-saving treatment to individuals who hadn't proven their political loyalty to maduro are these medical missions still going on in venezuela and what has been their impact to either one of you yes they have they they have been taking place in venezuela and in many other and in many other countries and and it is it is very important that not only not only united states not only the united nations that actually issue a report elevating the the cuba medical brigades treatment to the treatment of forced labor and it's very important that rest of the world restrained for participating in in this kind of activities that are designed to give money to the to the to the cuban repressors passing over the life and the and the human rights of the of the cuban doctors but you made a very good point because it's not this this uh this um international missions that the cuban regime has around the world and not just for uh for um are not just for money and also for espionage and i have a and i have a very a specific um data from the cuban medical missions that took place in bolivia during the eva morales and during the evo morales presidency from 503 medical doctors or supposed medical doctors working on venezuela 497 were not medical graduates so that the inversion that the bolivian state was making in medicine or health was actually being made on espionage and cuban estate security and um senor vivanco you mentioned earlier that the exportation of of cuban doctors has been helpful in some countries uh but compare that with the uh the information coming out of cuba in terms of the reality of health care on the island where in even in havana pregnant women are required to bring their own sheets that they actually have to bring cleanser so that they can clean the feces off of the walls and the toilets so that they can have some semblance of sanitary conditions to give birth can you can either of you um describe the facade the uh the the the real lies uh fabrications of the wonderment that is portrayed of how excellent the cuban healthcare system is compared to the reality of it being rationed and individuals particularly of afro-cuban descent are actually discriminated against when it comes to access to health care just a couple of points i i i do believe that the cuban doctors those ones who are doctors i'm not talking about spies cuban doctors are heroes and should uh and deserve uh as much as respect as we could give them right because they go out of them say it again my criticism is not of that no no that's right they're being enslaved very important to make that distinction between the doctors who goes to you know remote and poor communities all over the world to to to service them from the uh machinery this the structure used by the cuban government where the doctors become actually victims and they have no rights no right to you know privacy free of speech association and so on so forth by the way uh uh the chair of the subcommittee asked me before what happened if those any of those doctors apply for political asylum for instance you could focus if you could focus specifically on the actual the reality of healthcare access and conditions on the island i don't have that data the current data of reliable data we i don't have data because we don't have statistics but we have seen videos and we are in total connection we say cuban in in the island and the and the and the reality seems to be of a total collapse of the healthcare system at least in in the provinces of matanzas the the people were even not anxious yes the people were even dying in the aisles and in the entrance and in the houses uh without proper medical without proper medical attention we are facing a very a very hard crisis of of the sanitary system of the healthcare system and a and it's clear that the authorities of the detectives are not are not capable of actually solving the problem they are not prepared or they are not willing to mr chairman the portrayal of the cuban health care system is is mythological that it is one that provides all kinds of free and wonderful access to health care to people on the island that is simply untrue uh and in addition to that the reason that we don't have the information that we need is because they deny access to the data unlike free countries which universally share data so that everyone can have access to it and see what's really going on in terms of the treatment and the health and well-being of their people i yield back thank you congresswoman congressman perry thank you mr chairman and thank the witnesses um i read a book one time entitled and the russian state talking about cuba now the folks that are for ending the embargo some sitting at the table some on the other side of the aisle here in this building and and most uh i think importantly and vociferously the chinese the russians and the cuban dictatorship i think that's an interesting coalition it's important to recognize it for what it is miss paya can you can you describe to us if you can because we've heard the reports but it's hard to get verification what are the venezuelans and the russians and the chinese doing in cuba right now to to stomp out this freedom movement yes and and and again we only we only know what is public we only know what what what the anecdotes of of the witness in in kuwait mentioned but just taking into consideration what is public russia issued a statement in the in the first days of last week encouraging miguel diaz canel the puppet of raul castro uh which hold the charge of president of of the dictatorship and encouraging encouraging diaz canel to use all the measurements available seen the cuban law to stop the protest and uh that were not the the exact words but that was the message and i have to say to use all the measurements we see in the given law includes the uh includes the violence includes the weapons against the the cubans uh the cubans that are actually trying to change the system because actually the given constitution that was imposed in 2019 in the article 4 that constitution allows anyone to fight even using the they call it lucia armada even using weapons to fight anyone that is trying to change the political and economical system that that constitution established which is the cuban communist party as the director of the society and the state so basically putin was given um his endorsement to the killing of the cubans in the streets if they were trying to change to change the system having said so cuba the cuban regime have been the the gateway to the uh today to the intelligent service of of chinese of russians and the the connections the coordination the kind of a relationship that the cuban regime has over the maduro dictatorship have been widely widely documented and they are in charge for instance of the contra intelligence specifically the military country intelligence so that that's scary enough so so everyone knows the the russians and the chinese have their most important listening stations located in cuba right and and so if people are saying well mr v ivanko the the embargo is not working and i agree with you to a certain extent that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insanity and for 60 years and before that with batista the same thing right dictatorship and uh and us with the embargo now and hoping it will work but i would submit to you that that while i agree with you that it's not working under its current form because other countries are happy to trade with cuba they're happy to trade because there's something in it for them there's money in it for them there's influence there's china there's russia and this is the time right now is the time when the united states with the embargo needs to step up and do even more as the cuban people put their lives on the line literally on the streets of cuba at the hands of the venezuelans at the hands of the chinese and the russians who will kill them in their homes and now is the time for the united states to up the ante to say we even go to these other countries and say you must stop trading with them you must stop helping now is the time not not to back off not to do exactly what the dictatorship wants miss pi certainly the cuban people can defend themselves against the venezuelan police the russians the chinese certainly they can defend themselves they're armed aren't they no they are the disarmed say it isn't so and peaceful people demanding demanding freedom in the streets and they are confronting an estate with all its resources and the resources of the or their of their other of the other enemies of freedom to the world ladies and gentlemen now is the time for the united states to lead not back off on the embargo but to step up and force other countries demand other countries to step up and stop the insanity happening 90 miles off our coast i yield the balance thank you congressman congressman progress thank you mr chair and i believe it was albert einstein who was credited with saying if you do the same thing over and over again and you expect a different result that's insanity and i think that that's right i mean if you continue to to do the same thing expect a different result that is insanity i i'd i'd argue i'm everybody's putting the blame seems like not everybody but some people seem to be putting the blame on this administration but i would say hey where was the reagan administration where was the george h.w administration where was the george w administration where was the trump administration if it's so easy to do why wasn't it done i mean the reality is i think it's very difficult to get changed there and again because it does have i think these other states that help it i gave the chance last time how would you do it differently because it does seem to me that nothing's going to come of all this you're going to have a lot of poor people suffering in cuba again you're going to have this you know the people in the streets they're going to get repressed they're going to get attacked a lot of them not but a number of them are going to get killed they're going to disappear all the terrible things that normally happen and nothing's going to change because we're going to continue to do the same thing congressman vargas i i do appreciate the analysis of the of the history because i do believe that we are in a pivotal moment that this moment is qualitatively different from anything that we have seen before in the in in the in this 62 years we have seen massive protests across the whole island tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of cubans maybe millions of humans in the streets demanding freedom and demanding the the end of the dictatorship demanding those things from a dictatorship that actually isn't a one it is in one of the most vulnerable moments in history too for many reasons but also because the access to resources have been a have been diminished uh during the last uh during the last years but especially because the cuban people have fundamentally changed in in its behavior and it's going out in the streets and is demanding freedom not just not just on sunday but only during this year till january till june 30 there have been more than one thousand and one hundred protests in in cuba so there are many fresh and important things that international community and united states can do can do to help us and one of this is rise the cost of the repression against the given people imposing targeted individual sanctions against the the ones that are giving the orders to kill the and to shut down young people in the streets internet access if i could interrupt but i have to say i mean i'm old enough to remember the the collapse of the soviet union and that was also a moment like this when everyone said oh here it comes here's the here's where it's going to be the big change there wasn't we saw what's inspired you're talking about the collapse of the of the of the soviet union and but remember cuba talking about i understand but the reason i say that is that history seems to repeat itself i remember that time i'm 60 years old i don't know how old you are but i'm 60. and so i remember that time very well that this is an opportunity everybody's saying now it's going to happen there's going to be change on the island you're going to see now a democracy the casters are going to fall they didn't and and now i i look at it again and i i don't i mean i i'm not i don't want to argue with you because i agree i'd like to see the change probably we both like to see i'd like to see a democracy where people can vote freely who for whomever they want and not have the dictatorship that they have today i just fear that we're going to do the same thing again and nothing is going to change well you can help us to change that and that's part of why we are we are doing this and uh just just to clarify what is fundamentally different from 1980s is that it's not the soviet union collapsing it's the cuban people protesting in the streets is the the protagonic role here doesn't rely on any other foreign country that relied on the cuban people we are the protagonists of our of our history we are already being that and what we are asking is solidarity with the solution and the demand my time's about over that's the problem the solution i mean i think that there's a lot of solidarity there was back when the soviet union collapsed too and nothing happened that's my point that the solidarity was there but it's the the policy that doesn't change then practical things to do rights that rise the cost of the repression impose target assumptions over those that are still commanding a repression and give internet access without the censorship of the of the cuban regime apply the sullivan principles and take a similar approach to the one that you took with south africa to end the appetite involve the international community the european union the oas not under the uh the premise of the cynicism of the of the world with the embargo but on the premise of the cuban people demanding freedom on the streets i think that's that would be a fresh approach thank you very much thank you my time's up thank you congressman vargas congresswoman melatakus uh thank you very much and i again want to thank both of you for being here today and and to discuss a topic that is uh very personal and important to me and um certainly we talked a lot about what the buying administration should be doing and i i echo what you say miss paya when you say we need to involve the international community we need to speak we need the president to lead as the freedom leader of the free world to push for freedom and democracy in cuba and certainly use whatever abilities we have to engage the international community the freedom-loving democracies from around the world to also join that effort to push this regime out what i want to ask though is what can the united nations because i've been very disappointed with their lack of interest in actually assisting in this situation right now what do you believe the united nations should be doing at this time uh to help this cause thank you so much for that question and i have to say that uh that the i have been shut down by the given uh by the dictatorship that the ambassador of the given dictatorship in the human rights councils in united nations and the fact that they have a sit there is already very telling to a to what the united nations uh have been doing for for the cuban people anyways they are a special reporters that have to make his work uh their work and they have been doing it and and those kind of technical approach as the one that reported on the on the forced labors of the cuban doctors should be taken into consideration my my my suggestion of course i i was i'm hoping that the the the high representative michelle bachelet asked for a visit to the island and actually confirmed with her own eyes what is taking place in cuba i i don't i don't there a lot of hope for the given regime uh accepting that but that should be the kind of the kind of bold involvement that we are hoping for an organization that should be protecting the right to democracy and the human rights in cuba you mentioned the human rights council and i'm glad you brought it up because one of the reasons why president trump withdrew the united states from the human rights council is because it's a farce it's an absolute sham particularly when you look at the members who sit on that council it's not just cuba who you know allows no freedom of speech no freedom of press no freedom to demonstrate as we're seeing people being beat in the streets by communist regime forces uh they're being abducted and jailed and shot at they're treated as slaves for what equates to 15 u.s dollars a month they have the dual currency system something is they're being paid in cuban pesos and yet they're being asked to purchase things and something that is equivalent of u.s dollars and when it's a 25 to 1 ratio how do you expect them to do that and they're slaves to the government they don't have the right to come and go from the island as they please so the fact that cuba is on the human rights council along with china venezuela russia the most egregious human rights violators mr pavivenko as somebody who is involved with the human rights watch i would love for you to comment on on that it is a shame it is a shame there is no other you know reaction that is the the probably the most honest um comment that i can give you how dictatorship are members of the um the human rights council but let me explain to you one little detail which is i think is is relevant um they get elected because every region every geographical region of the world has some chance to present for instance one or two candidates for one or two vacancies last time when when venezuela was you know competing for a position unfortunately latin america we are giving two posts and latin america as a as a region presented two candidates for two posts so there was i mean and one of the candies was venezuela the other one was brazil and brazil under the current government of president bolsonaro very close ally to president former president trump you know decided to avoid any further candidate from stepping in because they were afraid that if there were three candies for two posts at the human rights council brazil will be eliminated so what we did was to convince costa rica in the last minute to run to try to defeat venezuela and costa rica did it but you know it was late already you know and for unfortunately finally brazil was elected and venezuela was elected any any advice you have for the biden administration at this moment when they're looking to re-enter human rights council how we can use that as leverage to try to change the makeup of this council i think that if you look at the um the votes the positions of the human rights council not the membership the membership i agree with you i mean at least i don't know 40 percent of them are dictatorship who get selected at the human rights council to protect themselves you know to try to interfere in the business of of the top entity that is supposed to supervise human rights all over the world but there is still a slim majority that is committed to fundamental freedoms and rights so i welcome the the decision of the current administration the body administration to rejoin the human rights council because there are very important battles and debates that are happening precisely there thank you thank you well we come to the end i want to thank you for your patience i want to thank you for coming and testifying before our committee and we'll just have some closer remarks and we'll close the hearing thank you again for joining us today i have been inspired by the scenes of courage we are witnessing in cuba young people in particular have been stepping up and making clear excuse me that they refuse to become a lost generation their creativity bravery and advocacy are they reminded that the status quo in cuba is a tremendous waste of talent and potential i urge the vine administration and my colleagues in congress to rise to the occasion and seize the this opportunity to help the cuban people nothing is more important to me than seeing the cuban people finally become free with that i turned it over to my colleague congressman greene thank you uh mr chairman for allowing some closing comments and i want to thank the witnesses for being here i want to thank you for your intensity i think on both everybody here is is excited about the opportunity that we see at this moment in time we're frustrated and angry with the human rights abuses that have gone on for so many years and i agree that with the embargo not working i just i think it's time to double down i think it's time and and my criticisms aren't of the biden administration per se as as much about you know earlier when i was talking about socialism and communism and i was i was referring to sort of fringe members i i think we all know the senator i'm talking about who supports socialism and uh my own colleagues here in the house who support socialism and and some who've advocated for universal rent control which is right out of karl marx uh that's not i'm not saying that's the biden administration i'm saying when i my criticism there is let's act it's time and there's a chance there's an opportunity to bring freedom to another group of people um and that's why i i'm so passionate um but i i believe very deeply that there's a lot of i was listening to you know congresswoman wasserman schultz who i i don't agree with very often but as she was talking about this i'm like yes that's right those physicians are enslaved and if they're doing that they'll probably sell vaccine we give them anyway right so i mean let's let's let's do what we can to continue to agree where we can and chairman sears i just want to thank you for your friendship and your unbelievable leadership on this issue over the decades you are a champion for the people of cuba um be because you are one of them and um you have done an amazing job uh leading through the challenges of a divided government here in washington dc thanks for your time appreciate y'all thank you thank you congressman green for those remarks and thank you for your comments and with that this hearing is a journey you

(https://www.uctv.tv)",1,"[MUSIC] Good morning. On behalf of the Institute
of the Americas, it's a pleasure to
introduce you to this morning's presentation
of our paper entitled, China takes the claim in
Latin American Energy: What it Means for our Region, the United States, and Beijing. This study, that was
undertaken by the institute, was made possible by support from Olympia Innovations
Foundation and the generous backing of the institute's energy steering committee
member companies. This morning, you're going to hear from two of the principal co-authors of the report,
Cecilia Aguillon, who's our director of our
Energy Transitions program, and Jeremy Martin, who's
the vice president of our Energy and
Sustainability program. We also have a discussion
panel that will follow the initial presentation
with Matt Ferchen, who is the head of
Global China Research at the Mercator Institute
for China Studies. Also, we have Michael Davidson, a professor at the
University of California, San Diego's School of
Global Policy and Strategy. Finally, I want to thank UCTV, University of
California Television, for co-sponsoring
this program with us. At this time, it gives me
great pleasure to present our paper and share some of
our key findings. Jeremy. Good morning. Thank you
very much for joining us. Definitely I look forward to sharing some of the
report highlights, but, first, before we
dive into the material, I'd like to also offer my sincere appreciation
on part of the Institute's Energy and
Sustainability Program to Alumbra Innovations
Foundation for their support of our research and, of course, the
publication of this paper. Let me underscore the
amazing support and research efforts
by a whole host of people. But bear with me, I want to indicate, by name,
some of these folks which has highlighted the incredible
role that Cecilia Aguillon, the Energy Transition
Initiative Director at the Institute of the
Americas, played in managing the overall
research project and in the writing of a
lion's share of the report. My colleagues,
Jacqueline Sanchez, who did amount of research,
Carlos Fernandez, Rita Oliveira, Diana Rodriguez, they're all working on the Spanish and
Portuguese versions, and we'll have those
out probably next week. We have the English
version that's come out yesterday and we'll share
that link again later. Also I want to make
sure we underscore the support of our
research interns from UCSD and University of San Diego, Rolando Almada, Zoe Xu,
and Teagan McGinnis. Last, but certainly not least, Joseph Mann, Matt Ferchen,
and Mikkal Herberg, were three instrumental voices and wise counsel as we worked through various
versions of this report and indeed brought it to
publication yesterday. We'll hear more from Matt
here in a little bit. For those of you who've
been able to already look at the report and
hopefully read it, it's 40 pages, and we're not going to go through
all 40 pages this morning. Don't worry, everyone, we don't have that much band
with our time, but we want you to read the entire report
obviously. So, indeed, what we'll do this morning is a few highlights that we'll tease out, and we'll share with you what we think are
some of the messages that are consistent through the 40 pages of the paper
that we'll have you read. Four or five key messages and takeaways that we
want to share and foster in our discussion
this morning: traditional investment strategies, I think
what we would call the China's designs
on Latin America and the Caribbean's oil
patch and oil sector, then we'll turn to new investment strategies, and spend a little
bit more time on mergers and
acquisitions, and share some important developments
in that sphere. China dominates
energy transition, and within that, and
this is where Cecilia will share a lot of her
research and writing. Renewable energy, but
also critical minerals, and that's going to
be something we'll talk a lot about this morning. Then the most recent development, which of course, in the process
of finalizing this paper, we had an election and we had a new president sworn in on January 20th in
the United States, and we'll talk about the
Biden administration, Latin America, and China, but particularly the
climate change angle. [NOISE] Traditional investment in Latin America's oil patch. I think that this
element of China's reach into Latin America is
pretty well-known, I think for most folks
joining us today, a lot of the story over the
last couple of decades, the element of China's
going out strategy, the incredible amount
of loans to Venezuela, $62.2 billion according
to one estimate, that were secured by oil, it's been clear for
at least a decade, if not more, that China
and Beijing's designs on Latin America's oil
patch were aimed at energy supply security and diversification of
supplies to meet its surging domestic
demand for energy. Of course, around 2010, China became one of the world's, if not the most, important
energy consumer in the world, and so in the going out strategy, being able to secure access to important upstream
supplies and really lock in energy security guarantor through geographic focal
points such as Latin America. But what I really want
to talk a little bit about is moving beyond that traditional designs on
Latin America's oil patch and that loans for oil, which we definitely
talked a lot about in the last couple of decades, if not around that
amount of time, is this evolving strategy to channel more investment or to channel their activity
to continue to move into the energy space in Latin America through mergers and acquisitions. Here's where I really want
to emphasize what I think is unique in our report and
where we've really tried to focus some of our efforts
in terms of China and in staking is claim
in Latin American energy. In the last couple of years, I think you really
see an effort on the Chinese to generate profits and keen interest on developing new
markets for products, particularly, in
terms of transmission and distribution of electricity, solar power, wind, and of
course, electric vehicles. There was a number that
came out just recently, we're able to include that
in our report, that said, in 2020, Chinese mergers
and acquisitions in Latin America reached
just under $8 billion. That was about 25 percent of China's acquisitions
worldwide. Latin America figured in 2020 for about a
quarter of the mergers and acquisitions that Chinese really state-owned
enterprises transacted. Those transactions
we've seen in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, and I'll talk in a minute
about some of those. Indeed, we have an image on the screen here of State Grid, and just as much as
China's designs on Latin America's
oil patch is a bit of well-worn territory
and folks know, I think people have probably now, at least, heard of State Grid, and where State Grid is figured
in this what I'm calling new investment strategy of acquisitions in
gobbling up assets, particularly in the
electric sector. In Brazil, State Grid's
investments total $12.4 billion, and for the company, that represents 60 percent of State Grid's investments
outside of China. Again, these are
important numbers when we look at
this new strategy, moving beyond just the
Development Bank, and the BRI loans, and loans for oil. One of those acquisitions
to reach that total was CPFL Energia in 2017, that was Brazil's largest
private energy company. It's now in the
hands of State Grid. 2019, China's Southern
Power purchased 27.7 percent of Transelec, an important transmission
company in Chile. State Grid, for those of
us here in San Diego, remember State Grid
purchased Sempra Energy's Chilquinta Energy, 100
percent of that asset, which is the third largest
distributor in Chile. Another deal, one occurring last year, that received a lot of attention, and continues to
receive a lot of attention, is a roughly $3 billion effort
to acquire by State Grid, Compania General de Electricidad from Naturgy in Chile. Again this has triggered something we talked a little
bit out in the report, and that is how
countries are going to manage these investments and these acquisitions of
critical infrastructure in the power transmission
and distribution markets of countries like
Chile and Brazil. Also it bears mentioning
what happened in Mexico, and this is a deal that we
don't have the numbers for, but China's State Power
Investment Corporation acquired Zuma Energia
late last year. For those of you
who follow Mexico, you know that Zuma
has been one of the first movers in terms of private participation in the Mexican renewable
energy space. It owns important
wind and solar assets and, indeed, is one of Mexico's largest renewable energy firms. The same firm has
other operations and renewables in
Brazil and Chile. I think all of this is also the perfect way to segue
way to what I talked about as one of our key
issues in the report, and that is China dominating
energy transition. With that, I would like to
turn it over to my colleague, Cecilia Aguillon,
who like I said, who I want to again commend
for an amazing job of leading this report writing, and it is a great
colleague who manages our Energy Transition
Initiative. Cecilia? Thank you so much, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone. Yes, I will share
with you some of our thoughts or research
on this subject. As you know, no one is surprised
to know that or to hear that China is the dominant
power in renewable energy. They are pretty much anywhere in the world today,
especially in Latin America. You see, at least, 90
percent or more of the products of the
technologies in wind and solar are made in China. The China's Global Energy
Finance database at Boston University shows some figures
that were interesting. Out of the $58.4 billion invested in
energy in Latin America, this is during the period 2019, only 15 percent was
spent on renewables. But keep in mind that renewable energy markets
in the LAC region, they are still emerging, so there's a lot of room to grow. China has been able to, almost overnight, create a robust
manufacturing base. I remember this because
I used to be in the solar energy industry
for many years, and it used to be a handful of Japanese and European companies
doing business in China, studying modules, and all of
a sudden from 2005 to 2010, we saw all these companies coming in with prices 30 percent, 40 percent below the
current market price, and every six months, you saw prices going
down all the time, so much so that Europe and the United States
imposed import duties on China because the factories
accused them of dumping. So what happened
though, in that time from 2010-2014, the equipment, solar wind equipment,
became so affordable that markets, like
Mexico, was able to create a robust industry or market for wind, and also
even rooftop, solar. So it was a benefit
for Latin America to have this price war
waging internationally. After that, the auctions became very in vogue
in Latin America, starting with Mexico in 2015, where prices of the energy
that came from the auctions, prices of the PPAs, Power Purchase Agreements,
were so low that it blew the expectations, and everybody thought it was not possible. But the next auction that
happened the year after, the price was still coming down. It just feels that there
is no bottom really, that prices continue to decline, and that
has benefited also Argentina, Chile, Brazil,
and most recently, Colombia. So all this equipment is
coming in from China, but now the Chinese banks
are getting involved because when any normal
investors sees the prices, the contract prices and the
conditions, and they think, ""Oh, this is not possible. This is not financeable. So now we need financing."" So now here comes China banks financing
projects in the region. Something very interesting
happened in Colombia. When Colombia had the
first auction in 2019, and the prices of that
auction came in, even lower than the ones in
Mexico, below three cents, those prices were interesting. But what was even more so was that the contracts were
in their currency, in the local currency, not in US dollars. Everywhere you see
contracts for PPAs in US dollars to give
confidence to the investors. In this case, it was
a risky proposition, but paid off for one entity,
was the manufacturer of solar panels that won pretty much all the solar portion
of the auction. Of course, what they
gain in return, maybe the deal was not as good as a normal investor would envision, but they will be shipping panels, they will be shipping equipment, and in some cases, they bring Chinese workers and
Chinese engineers, and they engineer
the project, etc. So there are other benefits that a normal company
will not get. It's quite interesting that you have the national government, the provincial government, and the banks loaning you money. So you don't see anything
like that in the world, and you can see how easily they became the dominant
force in the space. Jeremy talked about the M&A deal in Mexico with Zuma energy. What's interesting
to note is that, that deal occurred just when renewable energies are having a hard time to
get deployed in Mexico. So why would a company buy a renewable energy
entity during this time? It's interesting. But we don't stop
there, of course, because now the new
emerging technologies for decarbonization are
embedded in the batteries. So electric mobility, stationary batteries for
homes and buildings, and China is already paving
its way into this market and is sticking a flag
there to be the leader. We see that because
they are shipping electric buses to
cities like Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and most
recently, in Colombia, and this is happening when the
EV charging infrastructure in developing countries
is not really there, and the EV cost is not really competitive with
the traditional vehicles. So it's good for the
countries, of course, because they will be able
to get new technologies, but we just have to scratch our heads as to how
this is happening. So the dominance is also felt in the
batteries, I mentioned. There is a report by the Benchmark Minerals
reporting agency in market intelligence for
lithium ion batteries, they showed that the
largest producer of lithium ion batteries that go into the cars and in the
batteries for buildings, China has 63 percent share
of the world production. The United States is not
even a close second, so a distant second
at 14 percent. Chinese companies are pretty
much active throughout the entire value chain with
the battery production. This is a chart that I
took from a report that the Institute of the Americas
and the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of
Mines published last year about battery production
and the role that Latin American countries with lithium deposits play
or aspire to play. I apologize for the
quality of this graph, I took it from the paper. Here it shows where this
production is being done, and then the steps. Number 1 is lithium
deposit to concentrate, the number 2 column is lithium refining to
battery chemical, number 3 is cathode
manufacturing, number 4 is battery
cell manufacturing, number 5 is battery pack
and EV manufacturing, number 6 is EV market. You can see the United
States has California, Nevada, and North Carolina. Three states pretty
much play in all of the value chain except
for the number 3, which is the cathode
manufacturing. But Latin America, you see where the oil deposits are mostly, Argentina,
Bolivia, and Chile. Chile and Argentina are pretty well positioned
in the value chain, except they don't have
a market, and they don't really use cathode either. But Bolivia, believed to have the largest deposits
of lithium in the world, has aspirational goals, but we haven't seen them
playing in that space. And you go to China, and China is actually
all over it. They are everywhere in the space. It's interesting too, because now, there are a lot of
billions of dollars from Chinese state
companies that go to acquire high stakes
in the minings, and they get, as a result, to secure production and supplies of the lithium that
then go to China. A lot of the countries
that have the deposits, they are concerned
because they want to play in this space,
but they can't. So what they do is,
all the extractions go back to China to be processed because the processing is capital-intensive, and it is
not really cost-effective, and China's game has
been all along to reduce cost, and ship, and export. I don't see a way that we can get manufacturing of all of these processes in the countries
that have the lithium, so something is going to happen. In countries, they're
protesting in Chile and Bolivia about the
mining, and even Mexico, they were moving legislation
to nationalize lithium because they were
concerned about just being the provider of
the raw materials. At the end of the day, each country must balance
its desire or need for foreign investment
against the impacts of pollution of the ecosystem, and also, what do they gain? Do they gain more than they give? The same for China. A lot of the countries in Latin America are very keen
on continuing to ship, to export the product. So China offers a
great market for raw materials and even
for food products, but their investments and the trading partnerships
come with costs. As a condition to investments, you have to use
Chinese products and, many instances you have to bring Chinese personnel to
develop the projects. Also there is the issue with Taiwan, condition to have other countries recognize
Taiwan as a part of China, and things like that, that
it's always being weighted. Then we go to the United States. That has been one of the principal trading partners in Latin America and what
is going on there. Of course, there have
been concern about the growing presence of China, and particularly, the
strong control on minerals. It is believed that China
controls 80 percent of the critical minerals that
go into high technology, defense technology,
electronics, etc, telecommunications,
and of course, batteries, and the US really
want to put a stop to that. In 2017, then President Trump issued an executive
order with a plan to reduce the US vulnerability to these disruptions in the
supply of critical minerals, and included cooperation
with allies like the EU, Japan, South Korea to
counterbalance Chinese dominance. Peru and Brazil participated
in the initiative, which also promotes
sustainable mining. Another initiative that came out recently is called
the America Crece, which is translated into
Growth in the Americas. This is to attract investments in energy and infrastructure
in Latin America, and the idea is to encourage cooperation and
sustainable practices. These programs,
obviously, are relatively new. Now we have a new
President in the White House, so the question now is, what will the United States do? Joe Biden, he comes in as the new President with a host of domestic issues that
he needs to deal with, so how will he treat the
China-US lack relationship? For that question, I will give the mic back to Jeremy Martin, who will take us to
the finish line. Jeremy, back to you. Thank you, Cecilia. Well, indeed. We'll end here with perhaps one of our critical elements
to continue to assess, where we're not even a month
into the new administration. Cecilia, talked about some of the US government efforts
leading up to January 20th. Let me just tease
out what I think is an important area to keep
a focus on and look. We had a call yesterday between
Presidents Biden and Xi, that seems like the read-out
was a bit perfunctory, but it indicate some of the
typical talking points. In there, of course, is climate, and that's where I want to focus this last couple of minutes before we have our discussion. I think we all know that the the Biden administration arrived during the
transition, and now, of course, in office
with rightfully gaining a lot of headlines
about its efforts on climate. With that, on day 1 was the re-entry into
the Paris Agreement. That was an important shot
in the arm, I would suggest, for the international community
combating climate change. It also emphasized, as we all
had talked so much about, that Biden and his foreign policy sphere, the emphasis
on multilateralism. But I think, also, we anticipated and have already seen a whole slew of
executive actions, executive orders
from the President, day 1 on Paris re-entry. But a whole slew, like I said, of executive actions that really did place
combating climate change at the center of every part
of the national security, economic and, of course, international affairs and foreign policy of
the administration. Indeed, I want to
read one of those, some language, from one
of the executive orders because it's particularly
important for our conversation about
the Biden administration, its efforts in Latin
America vis-a-vis China. In one of the executive orders, it required all agencies
to develop strategies for integrating climate
considerations into their international work. So we're obviously going to move beyond just the State Department, the Development
Finance Corporation, the traditional areas where we saw the US government focus, and we sometimes,
from DC, hear this whole of government
concept, and I think that's indeed what this executive
order speaks to, with regards to climate, and of course in terms of how to confront China, in our
case, in Latin America. Further, the Biden
administration, some of his preliminary
investment strategies, has talked about emphasizing
clean energy, resilient and sustainable
infrastructure. They want to drive innovation. They want to deal with
confronting poverty and confronting corruption
issues, and of course, support the deployment of increased renewable
domestic sources of energy across the hemisphere,
and as they said, to begin to construct a secure middle-class
and democratic forms of government from
Canada to Chile. I think it's also
important when we dial in specifically
on the role of Biden's administration
and how we see his goals and objectives in Latin America play out
with regard to China. There has been language, and it's all within the quotes
here and we obviously, in the paper, get a lot more
deep into this conversation. But the attempt to rally
a united front to hold Beijing accountable to higher
environmental standards in, in this case, Belt and Road Initiative
infrastructure projects. But the emphasis and the
objective on trying to make high carbon and carbon
intensive kinds of projects, financing
and infrastructure, the goal and objective
of this point really to counter those
and make them more expensive and diminish
their development in the ensuing years
in Latin America. There is also an interesting, and part of the readout
of the call yesterday, we saw the affirmation of a potential US-China
bilateral agreement on carbon mitigation,
or an effort. There's a lot of i's to
dot and t's to cross, and then any bilateral
agreement in that regard. But I think it's also
important, again, to come back to this
multilateralism concept. Something else that the Biden administration in the transition has talked
about more recently, is using fora, such as the
G20 international fora, not just the Paris Agreement construct, but something such as the G20 group of nations to end all export finance subsidies
of high carbon projects. Again, trying to not just
offer a policy of negation, but to also offer a policy
of support, in terms of alternative development
financing that's aimed at low-carbon
energy investments. That's going to be critical
because, as we know, Latin America has been hammered by COVID-19 in economic terms, some of the worst downturns
in the region's history. So this element of
supporting and financing deployment of clean energy and combating climate
change is just as critical as, I would suggest, speaking to multilateral
approaches at the G20 to reduce carbon
intensity subsidization. A final couple of
points that I think are extremely important,
perhaps at this moment, more so, the first one
domestically in the US, but I think we'll see expressed and have seen
expressed in some of the language of the
executive orders that will ripple into the
foreign policy sphere, and that is the issue of climate justice and the
issue of adaptation. Now, climate justice, I
think is something that has been at the forefront of the
Biden team. If you look, not just with the
appointment of someone like John Kerry, Eugene McCarthy, but if you look at the Council of Economic Advisers, and
you look at some of the other folks on his team in foreign policy and economic
and national security, this is absolutely going to be something that's going
to be emphasized. It's been emphasized in one of the early executive
orders that I have some quotes here on the
screen, and we'll see that I, again, suggest playing
out in the region, perhaps not immediately,
but I think it's going to continue
to be emphasized. Then I think it's important
in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean
and Central America, we saw the horrendous impacts
of hurricanes last year. We see increased forced
migration because of climatic events and incidents. How can this
administration, really again, in this moment
of economic downturn, support resiliency and support a more robust infrastructure, or a resilient infrastructure
in the region that adapts to this ever-changing and increasingly
dramatic climatic events that we're seeing in Central
America and the Caribbean, and Mexico in particular? But droughts, and fires, and hurricanes, and tornadoes are not
limited to just those areas. Perhaps more pronounced
in those areas, but certainly
critical everywhere. I want to be able to have our expert commentators
share their thoughts. That is the 20-minute summary of a 40-page report. Let me throw it back over to the Institute of the Americas President, Richard Kiy, who will take it from here. Thanks so much, and thanks to Matt and
Michael for joining us. I look forward to their
comments. Richard. Jeremy, Cecilia, thanks so much for your excellent
presentation. At this point, I want to
reintroduce Matt Ferchen, who as I said, is the head of Global
China Research at the Mercator Institute. Matt is an expert on Chinese economic
statecraft and that country's Belt and
Road initiative in the developing world, with emphasis in Latin America. So he comes with a great deal of knowledge and
perspective that will, I think, enrich
this conversation. Then we'll follow up
with Michael Davidson, who's indicated as an
assistant professor at UCSD School for Global
Policy and Strategy, GPS. Matt, take it away. Great. Well, thank
you so much, Richard, and thank you to all of the organizers of today's
event and to Jeremy, in particular, for asking
me to be involved today as someone who was involved in the review and some feedback of the
original report. It's really a great joy to see what you've come up
with here and been able to incorporate a lot of detail and really important
insights into this report. I'm going to focus my
comments in three areas. One of them is this
distinction between traditional and new areas. The second one is the emphasis on the US role in political risk issues that
Jeremy was just discussing. Then the third area, sustainability issues
in global comparison. Let me begin with
the discussion of this traditional
versus new sectors. This is something that I
think comes up a lot in the broader relationship between
China and Latin America. This is in large part because the relationship
fundamentally continues to be about the export of raw
materials, largely from South America to China,
and on the Chinese side, the export of finance investment but also higher end
manufactured products. The real question here is, it continues to be, even as
we look at the distinction between traditional
and new sectors and energy transition
that the paper mentions, is to what extent will
the region be caught up again in commodity cycles
that we've seen in the past? Again there was a
really important cycle at the beginning of
the 21st century. The question mark now is on where does that
leave the region both in fossil fuels but also in
its energy transition sector? Pointing out that's obvious but continuing important area. The second thing I'd like
to mention here in the area of traditional versus
new sectors is the emphasis that
China is going to continue to place on
moving up the value chain. Again, whether that is in traditional or fossil fuels
that the paper points out, or in new sectors in
energy transition, renewables and critical minerals. China is going to present
its new five-year plan next month at the two
meetings session in March. We already have some indications of where that's going to go, but I think it's fairly clear that China is
going to continue to put a lot of emphasis on
innovation and technology. The question then is, what kind of challenges and opportunities does that present in these areas that the
paper highlights, again, in traditional
or fossil fuels, but also in the
energy transition? China is not going to stand still on anything that is brought up in the paper or in
anything that matters in this area of energy cooperation, investment finance, trade
with Latin America. This is just to point out that Latin American
governments, businesses, NGOs need to understand
that emphasis and try to harness it as best as possible, in terms of
potential for the region, but also to minimize risks. Let me move on to my
second set of comments then which is focused
on these issues of the US role in the region and political risk of
analysis and management. The paper certainly
brings this up. But as someone who
spent a lot of time and energy looking into the
China-Venezuela story, I just like to note that this Venezuela story,
as it relates to China's involvement in oil and lending, is not
going to go away. I would say it's been
on the back burner in global discussions about
China's role in debt. One of those discussions
are focused on Africans, and we'll talk
about more in a minute. This is just to say that
the Venezuela story is going to continue to be obviously important
to the people of that country, and neighbors,
and to the hemisphere. The China's rule there
is extremely important. It has not been resolved,
whether we think about its role in the oil sector there, or in lending, and the
future of the country. The role that the United
States is going to play there, this is mostly bunch
of question marks for me at this point, but we'll have to see whether
or not this comes on as a focus of the Biden administration's
policies in the region. Let me spend a couple
of minutes just talking about how I
see that playing out. Again, the report brings this up, and some of this is just echoing what what Jeremy
has already mentioned, but I think it's
really important. Clearly the Biden
administration ,harking back to the Obama administration,
is going to, I believe, put a lot more focus on
energy and energy technology in the region with a special focus, I believe, in Central America
and the Caribbean. A lot of this will focus
on how to either be competitive with or counter the proposition that China
makes in the region. I think a lot of
this will focus on these alternative energy issues. Here the question then is, what will the competitive
proposition be from the US? I think a lot of it will
be on energy technology. I don't think we're
going to see any major proposition of cooperation between the United States
and China in the region. It's mostly going to be
about US positioning itself. I think a lot of that's going
to be as a sort of partner in providing more quality, lower priced technologies for
energy generation and use. On the rivalry issue, I think it's certainly
worth all of our attention, is something the paper
brings up, to look more at the deal that
was negotiated in the final days of the
Trump administration with Ecuador and the Development
Finance Corporation. I'm personally skeptical that this is going to be a
model for the region. I think this was
something that was put in place by members of
the Trump administration. A lot of emphasis in that deal on how this is a way to combat
China's predatory lending. A lot of language similar to that which was used related
to that Trump diplomacy. This was all signature
Trump team policies. I think that there will be different proposition
on the table. I'm not sure how
that will play out, but I think this is
really important case. I just don't think it's
going to be necessarily an example in its details of how the Biden administration
chooses to go forward. Finally, in this area of
political risk and the US role. I think it is worth
all of us watching how China assesses political
and economic risk in the region, given maybe
a different kind of a renewed US
competitive position in the region and probably more
attention on the region for the Biden administration
in particular in these areas of energy. Then let me make a
final set of comments then about sustainability
and global comparison. The report does an excellent
job of committing to many of the different details of the specifics of the China-Latin America
energy relationship, that I think is something
that we should all, I think we should laud the
detail that is provided for the specifics of the China-Latin
America relationship. But I would just also point out that many of the issues that are brought up in the paper are relevant for other regions. Let me just quickly go through the three areas where I think
there's relevance here. First is in this
area of debt traps and lending transparency, which the paper points out. This is an extremely hot topic
in other regions as well, in particular, in South Asia, Southeast Asia, as
well as Africa. There is an extremely
high level of interest in these issues of debt
sustainability, in particular, and sort of understanding
financial flows, in particular, from China to
developing country regions. Again, a lot of
emphasis on Africa and South Asia, and trying
to track these flows. I would just point you in the direction of some of the
work that's being done by academics in international
institutions and governments to
try to understand this in Europe and elsewhere. Second area is governance, influence, and leverage that
the paper brings up here. What kind of leverage or influence is China
able to achieve as a result of deeper trade investment and
financial relations, especially as it
relates to energy? There is, again, a high
level of interest in exactly these issues in
areas like Southeast Asia, but also pointing to the limits of how much
leverage China is actually able to gain, as a result of deep interdependence,
even with its neighbors. This is just pointing
you to researchers in particular who are
doing really good work at this level of investment and finance, as
well as, influence. Then pointing to how to
manage some of these issues of economic interdependence
and influence. The EU, in particular,
is rolling out investment screening mechanisms
across member states. I think there might
be examples here of that process and then
also the details. Lastly, in terms of environmental and local
community impact, the way in which
governments, firms, NGOs in Southeast Asia and Africa are emphasizing these
exact same issues and the way in which the
development community in Europe and elsewhere is also focused on trying to
improve the environment and local community impact
of Chinese investment and financing in
all of these areas. I will wrap it up then with just two last very
quick comments. The first is the importance of this cross-regional
lesson sharing. I hope this report feeds into
some of those discussions. Lastly, just the importance
of, for all of us everywhere, of increasing
our knowledge about China. It's a long-standing
challenge and goal, and this paper just emphasizes
the importance of that. Thank you, and I look
forward to the discussion. Matt, thank you so much. At this time, it gives me great pleasure to introduce
Professor Davidson. Professor Davidson
is an expert on Chinese investment in
electricity markets in the developing world, and I think he's going to offer
us a great perspective on the key findings of this
report. Professor Davidson. Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Jeremy
and Cecilia, for walking us through this
really interesting report. It's a very welcome
and detailed look at the ongoing changes of China exerting its influence globally. I'm going to focus on two aspects that were
highlighted today: the new investment strategies
and energy transitions. First off, we've been
hearing a little bit about the Belt and
Road Initiative. This was launched in 2013. There's some difficulty
in pinning down exactly what's in BRI
and what's out of BRI. But you can actually
think of it as an extension of the earlier
going out strategy, which was an opportunity for China's large
state-owned enterprises to address their domestic
production overcapacity and then become national
champions, now is promoting Chinese
technologies and standards, and also
strengthening economic, political, and increasingly
military influence worldwide. An important element
what the BRI gives to these countries is that it's not only bringing technology, it's also bringing equity, and it's also bringing export
finance, and those are really key issues for very expensive
infrastructure projects. I thought I'd start with
the solar question. I think solar is really
interesting example here. Mexico and Brazil are now in the top 10 countries of
China's exporting PV. This is surpassing
Spain and Germany, which were the earlier
leaders in PV adoption. Now we're seeing that
Latin American countries are really benefiting
from that early learning. But there's almost
no Chinese-owned overseas PV
manufacturing capacity in the region, as
was pointed out. These are still largely
concentrated in Southeast Asia. Now that makes sense, given the other economic integration
in the region with China. But China's cost is now making
this very attractive for meeting LAC renewable
energy goals. I think, if folks
are interested or concerned about what
that [inaudible] means, you can really look to India as a potential litmus
test as to how easily a country can indigenize solar PV after the costs
have really come down. It's going to be difficult
and expensive, and we're not sure yet what
that's going to look. It's also important
to recognize that, if you look across the
solar value chain, there are much more jobs
in installation, balances, systems maintenance, then in the direct module
production itself. So the globalized
supply chains in the learning are the reason that we're talking about unsubsidized
PV tenders at the moment. Now if we think about China's power-generating capacity
investments abroad, you usually hear about coal, gas, and large hydro. Now we see a lot of gas and
large hydro in Latin America. Coal, which is, by and
far, the largest criticism of BRI in environmental grounds,
is not an issue in LAC. So that's an interesting
distinction. I wanted to talk a little
bit UHV transmission lines. I've been following
China's domestic energy transition for some time. China has the most of ultra high voltage transmission
lines in the world, around 30 now, and the longest line in the world surpassing
Belo Monte just recently. It's really a success story
of China's grid companies, in particular State Grid
and industrial policy. State Grid has been actively
moving overseas as some of the projects that it was building within country
are now drying up. The report points out
very importantly that 60 percent of that activity
is now located in Brazil. All transmission
lines are going to be controversial, regardless
of who builds them. So it's really important
to keep that in context. Also, there is a lot of
foreign ownership in distribution companies
in Latin America. For example, Chile,
State Grid's purchase of the distribution company was actually from a Spanish company, and there's still
an NL in Italian, a distribution company in Chile. There's a lot of
foreign influence in this distribution level and transmission level
grid companies. An organization affiliated
with State Grid, GEICO is now eyeing much larger transmission grids abroad trying to
develop a lot more of an emphasis within the
global community to build much more transmission lines
and State Grid will very well poised to take
advantage of those. One last comment before I get to the questions here is
on EVs and batteries. China has really
innovated in EV space. It's primarily from private
companies outside of these large state-owned
joint ventures. So BYD, Neo, and others, and these have been really helped by domestic and local government
procurement and subsidies. It's really developing off of a local demand for
those products. Ninety nine percent as a
result of electric buses in the world are now made
for and used in China. I'm not sure if the Colombia
deal changes those numbers, but it's still
overwhelmingly within China. These EV manufacturers are now in a position where they
could set up shop in destination markets
if those markets are big enough and if the
governments allow them. We have an issue in this country about whether or not
we want to allow BYD to build electric buses
for our municipal fleets. On the battery side, China indeed has the largest production capacity
of lithium batteries. But the tech leaders,
the ones that have the most patents and are the most innovative, are
really Korea and Japan. They've been setting up these battery mega factories in China. Most advanced ones, like
the ones that are supplying the cylindrical cells for
Tesla's models are coming from, for example, LG Chem, Panasonic. China went big into a
different chemistry that doesn't require cobalt, and there's some
potential innovations on that front that could make it more suitable for
medium range EVs. But we know that
we're going to need cobalt and lithium and some of these other advanced technologies for EVs going into the future. That really begs the
question of whether or not China can really catch
up to that level, and develop those new
generation of batteries. Then finally, what
would it take for LAC to develop a battery hub? There is a lot of
questions around, where should you locate
within the supply chain? You can look to the
question of why do international suppliers
locate in China? There is a huge
market, the demand, China sold 1.3 million
EVs last year. Europe was just slightly
larger than that. The entire continent of Europe. There's demand, there's
infrastructure, and there's labor. There's a lot of components
that make that very attractive to build those mega factories in China. So it's really a question
about whether LAC can develop those promising conditions to develop a battery
hub going forward. Again, really interesting
report, and I'll save the rest of my time for
questions from you all. Thanks. Thank you, Michael. At this time we're going to take questions. We're not going to be able to get through all of the questions. We've got over 20 questions
that have come in. With that, we'll start with the first question
from Nick Pooba, who's asking about whether Mexico's AMLO
Administration may look to China to counteract US
pressured to preserve its electric sector
restructuring. Jeremy, Cecilia, you want
to take that question on? AMLO is interested in
indigenous local production. China is not really buying
much oil from Mexico or investing in oil in Mexico but they are
investing in lithium, for example, and the purchase of Zuma that Jeremy
mentioned, Zuma Energia. So I don't think so.
I think that they will continue to focus on the renewables and lithium for now but they purchased Zuma, so that means that
they are coming back. They have hopes for
renewable energy. Jeremy? I would just add that
the domestic situation with regards to policy and regulation of the energy
sector in Mexico is so fluid, and so counter to any kind of international
participation, whether it be from
China, the US, anywhere. I mean, you have a fervent effort to make CFE the only game in
town in the power market. Thank you, John. We've got
another question from Danny, who asks about the
oversized amount of external debt held by Latin American
countries from China, and wanted to know
if we could talk to the point of debt leverage
that China has over countries. Matt talked about this a little, but there's the issue in the report about
China's hidden debt, that is not truly transparent to the
international communities. So many creditors don't know fully how much is being
lent to these countries. Jeremy, you want to
take that question? I would just commend
people to read the report. I would echo what
you just said about, there's a lot of lack
of understanding because we just don't have
access to some of the details. I thank Matt for emphasizing what that
means vis-à-vis Venezuela, particularly, as
we try and manage that failed state
situation there. I look forward to
seeing what Matt things about that question
because, I think Matt, you've looked a lot more at the role and leverage
of the ""debt"". Yeah, it's just to say this
has not been resolved at all. It's interesting
how in the rest of the world this has
become a big issue, especially China and Africa. Obviously, in the wake
of the coronavirus, debt is also a major issue, so lots of discussions about China's role in debt refinancing, and the fact that
China is increasingly focusing on bilateral
negotiations, very difficult to
get it involved in multilateral negotiations, so that includes
difficulties with Venezuela's partners
or neighbors. The only other
thing I would point to is the good work that the folks at the
Inter-American Dialogue and Boston University are doing, showing that the policy bank
lending is dropping off, but then there's all
kinds of alternative commercial and other
firm lending happening. The lending flows are switching, but there's still going to be lots of questions
about sustainability. Thank you, Matt. We have a
question from a Farah from Unicef regarding
China's investment in hydrogen technology
in Latin America. If anybody has any
comments on that front. Well, the hydrogen,
we haven't seen much. To be honest with you,
in their research, it seems to me that
the green hydrogen is really being led by Europe, and now the US
is getting involved in. Maybe Canada is developing a
national hydrogen strategy. I think hydrogen is
definitely one of these questions where it fits in, and like Cecilia said, we have this rainbow
of colors of green, blue, gray hydrogen and
what's going to happen. We have a question
from John Jacobson, who asks if we could address
China's presence in Guyana. Jeremy, you were a co-author of a recent report on Guyana, do you want to take
that question? Yeah. I mean, let me just focus
on the oil patch because, there have been
some other mining, there's some historical and, I think perhaps the
questioner is also interested because there was a
bit of a kerfuffle in the last couple of weeks, to the point of what Cecilia
mentioned in the One China. This issue that's been
particularly important in the geopolitics of
Central America and the Caribbean, and that is, mainland versus Taiwan and how to manage those
relationships, so that's something we've seen playing out in Guyana lately. But in terms of the oil patch, I think we've seen
something that underscores the desire for China to continue in the going out strategy, what I would call securing
supply, diversity of supply, guaranteeing energy security on the back of a
variety of projects. To that point, one of the major Chinese
state-owned enterprise, national oil companies,
has a quarter, a 25 percent stake in the
Stabroek Block project, which is the one
that when you hear about oil production
and the boom in Guyana, that's really what we're
talking about today. As that ramps up, and people expect Guyana to
become one of the top three, four oil producers in the region on the back
of these discoveries, think about CNOOC with 25
percent of that project. Okay, we've got another
question from Tio Rikez, who asks about US competitiveness and talks about
attempts in the past to invest in Central
America and Caribbean. He is wondering about what the Biden administration
is going to do better to improve the possibilities of investment by
private entities, given that we haven't done such a great job over
the past 40 years. I was lucky enough to take a trip also in the
Caribbean in 2018 when the Trump administration
was really ramping up some of
the emphasis on alerting governments and
businesses in the region to concerns about China's role. In discussions with US diplomats, they were searching around for exactly answers
to this question, of instead of complaining or saying that
China's a bad actor, what do we have in place? I think that's what's
on the agenda. I mean, I think that the Biden administration in
particular is going to have a few people that
have been thinking about this for a few years, but it's easier said than done. It really requires coming
in with alternative vision, but also money, technology, ways of putting your money where your mouth is when you complain
about what China's doing, so I'm also eagerly
waiting to see what the team comes up with when they say they're going
to be more competitive. I think we've run out of
time, it's ten o'clock. I want to thank everyone
for their participation. As I mentioned,
we're going to work to respond to the
remaining questions. I want to thank our panelists, Matthew and Michael, our
co-authors Jeremy and Cecilia. I want to thank A Little
Renovation Foundation for their generous
support as well as our energy steering committee. Finally, I want to
also thank you, CTV as a co-sponsor of this program and our Hemisphere in
Transition webinar series. Thank you everyone for
attending, and we look forward to continuing discussions
on this issue and others. [MUSIC]"

and welcome to today's events. My name is Douglas Rogers, I teach in the Anthropology Department, and I'm the Faculty
Director of the program in Russian East European
and Eurasian studies. Today is a special event not
just because of our guest, who's one of the most well
known, most distinguished and most fascinating
journalists and broadcasters in the past 50 years,
anywhere in the world, but because in a much
smaller and more modest way, this is the first time that words ""Program in Russian East European
and Eurasian Studies"" are being uttered in public at Yale. Applause is appropriate.
(audience applauding) Our program dates from July 1st, 2018. And we think that the
interest that we're carrying around campus and full
auditoriums like today are good evidence of expanding
interest in the study of this part of the world. So thank you for coming. Look at our website,
get on our newsletter, we hope to bring you many
more events like this. I want to thank MacMillan Center, the Council in European Studies, for helping us with this event also, and especially the Poynter
Fellowship in Journalism, and the Office of Public
Affairs and Communication. Eileen O'Connor is somewhere here. Thank you very much for your
partnership in this event and many other events
we've had in the past and hope to have in the future. The plan for today is
that I will turn things over to Constantine Muravnik,
who I'm also very grateful to for suggesting this program
and for doing a lot of the work to make it happen. He'll introduce our guest, who will then speak for a little while, followed by sort of open question answer and discussion period. So without further ado, Constantine. (audience applauding) - It is my distinct honor to welcome Vladimir Pozner to Yale. Mr. Pozner needs an
introduction only for those who are too young to remember
the '80s and the '90s in this country when he regularly appeared on Ted Koppel's Nightline
and The Phil Donahue Show and then co hosted the
Pozner/Donahue show on CNBC. At that time, he once visited Yale, so it's not a welcome but a welcome back. Mr. Pozner may also need
an introduction to those who are detached from contemporary Russia, where he is omnipresent in the media. For the past 10 years, he has
hosted a weekly show, Pozner, where he interviews various
national and world leaders from all walks of life;
Gorbachev, Sekulow, Gaidar, Shoigu, Ted Turner and Vekselberg, Hillary Clinton and Sting, Michael McFaul and Ksenia
Sobchak, among many others had a chance to face Mr.
Pozner's thoughtful scrutiny and be judged by millions
of Russian viewers. Mr. Pozner's opinions on
a wide range of questions from politics to soccer,
from history to astronomy, and arts quickly go viral. They have become a fact of
Russian life to such an extent that he has been termed,
half seriously, half in jest, the spiritual leader of the
nation and its moral compass. This is despite the fact
that Mr. Pozner is Russian just as much as he is
an American or French. He was born in France and
christened in Notre Dame, grew up in the U.S. and came to Russia only at the age of 19. Perhaps this cosmopolitan
aspect of his biography is what endears him to Russian public, tired like any other public,
of ideological agendas. Perhaps, this ability to
be simultaneously Russian and American and European
attunes Mr. Pozner to the subtleties of
different perspectives, and brings him one step
closer to the much desired and no less appreciated
objectivity and truth. Especially now, when the
gaps separating governments and nations are only widening. And one side increasingly
refuses to consider the views of the other. In his more than five decades
in the field of journalism, Mr. Pozner has done his share of partisanship and propaganda. However, this changed in the '80s when he pioneered a project of so called space bridges,
or tele bridges that connect with Russian and American audiences. Moscow viewers named him ""TV
Journalist Number One"" in 1989. And this high mark of recognition has never decreased ever since. In 1989, and in from 1994 to 2008, Mr. Pozner headed the
Russian Television Academy. In 1997, he founded the School
for Television Excellence, a platform for education and
promotion of young journalists. He's written several books and made a number of
documentary miniseries about different countries,
their cultures and people. These films brought the
U.S., France, Italy, Germany, England, Israel and Spain closer to millions of Russian people. It is my hope that this
conversation with Mr. Pozner at Yale will also achieve what
he has been so good at. That it will bring
Russian views and opinions a little closer to our
students and colleagues, and will maintain what
we all need now the most, a dialogue, based on mutual
understanding and respect. So please join me in
welcoming Vladimir Pozner. (audience applauding) - Thank you very much. Quite an introduction. I'd like to say a couple
of words about who I am and what I am not withstanding
what we just heard. It's important that you understand that I don't represent
anybody or anything. Any organization,
political, social, whatever. I represent myself. I am an independent journalist. And that's an animal that
is disappearing in Russia and not only in Russia. I think, for me, it's
important that I say that and I hope I'm not going to speak long because I was told we would
have a conversation afterwards. And I think that might be the
most interesting part of it because you have questions or views that you might wanna share with me, and I can't guess them in advance. But there are certain
things I'd like to say before we have that conversation. I'd like to say, first
of all, that we are, at an extremely dangerous moment today. Never have the relations between Russia and the United States
with the Soviet Union, not what it was before,
been at this level. During the worst times of the Cold War, when I was living in the Soviet Union, and I remember all that very, very well. Russians were anti White
House, anti Wall Street, but not anti American,
in their vast majority. In fact, there was a
kind of a warm feeling vis-à-vis the Americans. Today that's different. Today it's anti American
at the grassroots level. And there's a reason for it. Another thing that is, to me scary is that neither side seems to be afraid of nuclear weapons. 30 years ago, those of
you who are of my age certainly remember an American
movie called ""The Day After,"" which is about what happens
to you and to your country after a nuclear strike. There was fear of these weapons as there was in the Soviet
Union, there was a realization that these weapons can and if
used will destroy our countries. Today, there's a feeling
when you talk to people, it's as if there are no nuclear weapons. It really doesn't seem to
play a role in how we act. And the danger of a not a
deliberate nuclear exchange, but an accidental one has
grown because the level of mistrust between the two
countries has grown as well. There have been several times in the past when computers warned of a nuclear attack. But it never got to the real thing because people took the
time to really check it out. Now, they didn't have a long time. If an ICBM is launched from Russia, it will take about 10 minutes
for it to hit the U.S. So you know, and vice versa obviously. So you don't have a long
time but you do have some. But my feeling is that if today those same computers malfunction
and it's on either side, that an attack has been launched, the response would be immediate. Because the feeling is that
this is what's going to happen. Not that long ago, we were all
very optimistic, weren't we? Gorbachev, Gorby, Gorby,
Russians, we're gonna be friends, we're gonna be... And in such a really short period of time, how did this happen? Why are we at the point that we are today? And I'm not saying who's to blame, because that's not a productive
way of looking at things. But we should try to understand
exactly what did happen. The Soviet Union once Gorbachev took over, didn't really last very long. He came to power in March of 1985. And by December 1991, there
was no more Soviet Union. Some people say, it
collapsed. It didn't collapse. In a place called the Belavezha, which is a kind of a
forest, three presidents, the President of Ukraine,
the President of Belarus, and the President of Russia
proper, Mr. Yeltsin, decided to part company, decided to
disband the Soviet Union. Now, each had his own reasons, definitely. But if we look at Mr. Yeltsin,
his reasoning was very clear. He was the President of Russia. So he was number two to Gorbachev. Because Gorbachev was
President of the Soviet Union, which Russia was part, the
largest part, but only part. Get rid of the Soviet Union, and there's no president and
you get rid of Gorbachev. That's precisely what he did. So no more Soviet Union. Quickly no more Warsaw Pact,
of course, that is to say, countries that were usually
called Soviet satellites, and part of a military
alliance with the Soviet Union, that Alliance disappeared. And so the United States
had to figure out, how do we deal with this
new entity called Russia? How do we deal with it? There's no more Soviet Union. What is going to be U.S.
policy, vis-a-vis this country. And of course, Yeltsin also had to think about what is going to
be Russia's attitude towards the United States. You may remember that soon
after the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and I think
it was February of 1992, Yeltsin came to the United States. And he addressed the
joint session of Congress. And he said, the people of
Russia are offering their hand to the people of the United
States in friendship, to build a better world,
a world without war, a world with our peace. And this was exactly
what the vast majority of Russians wanted. And I would even say that
today, the vast majority of Russians would like to
have, if not a friendship with the United States,
at least a partnership. There's no doubt to my
mind that that's the case. So that was what Yeltsin wanted, and what kind of response did he get? What kind of response did Russia get? Well, the United States
could have picked two ways of treating Russia. One was to say, let's treat
Russia like we did our enemies after World War II, Germany, Italy, and in some of the countries
that were occupied, such as France, or were
not occupied such as UK but were really badly hurt. Let's find a way to see to
it that in those countries, Nazis, fascists do not come back. And communists do not come
to power, and may remind you that in those days, the
Communist Party of France and the Communist Party of
Italy were very, very powerful. And that plan turned out was
called later the Marshall Plan, which was basically a
financial idea to spend a lot of money but in a very precise way to develop certain things, and not to allow others to develop. Now, that could be the policy,
to adopt vis-a-vis Russia. See to it that democracy begins
to develop in that country. And let me say, just for the record, Russia never in its entire thousand years, never had democracy, completely absent. So it wasn't like something
that once upon a time Russians had, and then they
lost, but they knew what it was. They didn't know what it was. So let's spend money on getting
democracy moving in Russia and seeing to it that the
communists do not get back. And that could have been one approach. The other approach was
to say, for 40 years, you held a nuclear bomb over our heads, you lost the Cold War, and
you're gonna pay for it. You're gonna be punished for what you did. And there were people who
supported one view and people who supported the other in this country. Early in 1992 a document was
produced in the United States by a gentleman called Paul Wolfowitz. You may know who he was, he
was Under Secretary of Defense of the United States
responsible for policy. The document he produced came to be called the Wolfowitz Doctrine, 
not officially, but that's the way it was addressed. It later was incorporated in something that was officially
called the Bush Doctrine. That document was leaked
to the New York Times. And so it became public. And what it basically said,
and you can look it up, it's available, you know,
just go to Wolfowitz Doctrine, and you'll find it, what
it basically said was this. The United States should never again, allow any other country to challenge it. The United States must
remain the superior country. And we should tell our allies not to worry about developing their own weapons because we will do that for them. And we must watch out for Russia because we don't know
which way it's going to go. The bear might get up on his
hind legs again, and growl. When that document was
leaked to the New York Times, there was an outcry by the
more liberal, if you will, in America now the word
liberal and conservative has lost the meaning that
it once upon a time had. So when I say liberal, I'm not sure that I'm saying the right word, but at least many people
were upset by this document. Edward Kennedy said that it
was an imperialist document that no country could or should accept. It was quickly as it were removed and rewritten by Mr. Cheney. Not a very liberal man in any sense as far as I can remember. And the Secretary of Defense
in those days, Mr. Powell, but basically it retained
that view, Russia and America must remain, was to be
the only superpower. And basically, that view was
the one that was accepted. It was the one that was accepted. And the attitude towards
Russia was pretty much, you're no longer a superpower. You are a second rate country. Just, just keep quiet, please. This became evident and
would be evident to you if you follow the policy
of the United States. Now, let's begin with
going back to Gorbachev and his meetings when he
was asked by several people, all of them quite important,
to allow Germany's to reunite and take down the Berlin Wall. And he was told by James Baker, and now this is not many people. I mean, when I would say this, many people say, it's
not true, it's not true. He was told by James
Baker, if this happens, NATO will not move one inch eastward. Well, not long ago, on
December 12th, 2017, the National Defense archives of George Washington University, declassified the minutes of
the Baker - Gorbachev discussion, and it's there. But it's not only Baker
who said that to him, there was several people there, the German leadership did, Western Germany those days and so on. And finally, I'm not saying,
I don't know whether Gorbachev could have stopped Germany from re-uniting but the fact of the matter
is that they said yes and took down the Berlin Wall. And NATO stayed put, it
stayed put in those days. It stayed put under Bush Senior, it stayed put during the
first four years of Clinton. But in the next four years
in 1996, approximately, a decision was taken to enlarge NATO, three countries; Poland, the
Czech Republic, and Hungary. Now, I'm gonna read something to you. You know who Thomas Friedman is? New York Times old hand columnist. He, when this happened, this
is already in 19, this is 1998. He called up George Kennan. I don't know if you're all
aware of who George Kennan was, but he was one, in my opinion, perhaps one of the most brilliant minds, political minds of the United States in the second half of the 20th century. The man who devised
the idea of containment of the Soviet Union rather than war against the Soviet Union,
successfully did this. So, you know, a brilliant man who established the very
foundation of U.S. policy, Vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. So Thomas Friedman called him up. The article he published
in the New York Times, it's called ""Foreign Affairs;
Now a Word From X,"" why x? Because in 1947, in the
magazine Foreign Affairs Mr. Kennan had published this
article about containment, and he signed it X. So he called him up and he asked him, what did he think about his
decision to enlarge NATO? Let me quote, ""I think
this is May 2nd, 1998. ""I think it is the
beginning of a new Cold War, ""said Mr. Kennan from his Princeton home. ""I think the Russians will
gradually react quite adversely, ""and it will affect their policies. ""I think it is a tragic mistake. ""There was no reason for this whatsoever."" That decision, and now
I'm giving you my opinion, is what really started this relation, turning itself, as you might say, that's where it all began. Because the Russian reaction
and specifically this is 1998, So this is Yeltsin, late Yeltsin was, ""you promised not to do this. So, how do we trust you,
if you make a promise?"" I would also like you to, perhaps try to solve a little problem. It's a kind of a mathematical. Take the time from when
Gorbachev came to power, March 1985, to 2007, when Putin has been in power for seven
years, that's 22 years. I ask you to find a single thing in foreign or domestic policies
done by the Soviet Union while still existed,
and then Russia proper that might in any way anger, irk, disappoint the United States. Let me answer that for you. Nothing, not one thing during that period. Now, what did Russia
get as a result of that? First, the enlargement of NATO. So that was number one. Then the bombing of Yugoslavia. That was done by NATO and
NATO is after all dependent mostly on the United States. Let's face it, right? The UN did not condone this. So the bombing of Yugoslavia
that's from March 24th,'99, to June 10th, '99. Then Kosovo and recognition of Kosovo although it had been part
of Serbia for centuries, and there were people in Russia who said, you're letting the genie out of the bottle. Because if you do this, then
there are other countries that will do the same. And Russia did the same Vis-a-vis (indistinct) to begin with, okay. Yelstin was very angry. He made a speech, he said, and of course, this is very Yeltsin-like. He said, ""We're not Haiti,
you can't treat us like Haiti. ""Were a great country. ""We have a great past and
Russia will come back. ""Russia will come back."" He was really, really angry. He didn't say the
politically correct thing but he spoke his mind. Then finally 2000, year 2000,
Mr. Putin is not elected, although elected to the presidency. And one of the first thing
he does is to ask for Russia, to become a member of NATO. Why not be a member of NATO? NATO was created to defend Europe and perhaps not only Europe
from Soviet aggression, from a country that you couldn't predict. There is no more Soviet Union, and there is no more Warsaw Pact. Why can't we create an organization where we are part of it, said Mr. Putin, and act together to protect
from some kind of aggression. He was told, go take a walk, basically. What about some kind of partnership or becoming part of the European Union? Again, and this is all
documented, everything I say, except when I say my
opinion, is documented, you can look it up. And he said, no, you know, you're too big. Your country is too big, you can't. And all the while Russia
was being reminded that it's no longer really
that important a country. Now, one of the things
you must keep in mind is that much like the
Americans, the Russians believe that they have a mission,
that their country was selected by destiny. Now, you know, my being
French I laugh at that. I laugh both at you and at them. Because we French know that
we're the best and we are known, and we have no mission,
you know, that's it. But seriously speaking, that's a fact. And so the sense of losing
this aura of greatness of being told, we don't care about you, the reaction of the
average Russian to that was one of you're insulting me. You don't respect me. And so the anger, gradually, and the anger focused on Gorbachev. Many, many Russians figured
you sold the country. You don't stand up to these men, to the United States. And then the same thing for Yeltsin. You'd be surprised how unpopular Gorbachev and Yeltsin are today in
Russia, maybe 5% support them, precisely for that reason? Well, there are some others as well that have to do with economic
things, but nonetheless. So now here we have Putin, who as you know, as soon as 911 happens, calls up, Bush Jr. W, and offers his help. And yes, and does help in Afghanistan. And if you wanna have your soldiers, your military people in Central
Asia, right on our borders, be my guest and in Georgia, absolutely. So it's not just words, you know, we wanna fight terrorism together and gets nothing in exchange. So finally in 2007, in
Munich speaking to the 20, the group of 20 in
Munich, Putin says this. This is February 10th. ""I think it is obvious that NATO expansion ""does not have any relation ""with the modernization
of the Alliance itself ""or with ensuring security in Europe. ""On the contrary, it represents
a serious provocation ""that reduces the level of mutual trust. ""And we have the right to ask against whom ""Is this expansion intended? ""And what happened to the
assurance of our Western partners ""made after the dissolution
of the Warsaw Pact, ""where are those declarations today? ""No one even remembers them. ""But I will allow myself
to remind this audience ""what was said. ""I would like to quote the
speech of General Secretary, ""Mr. Berner of Brussels on May 17th, 1990. ""He said at the time, quote,
the fact that we are not ready ""to place a NATO army
outside of German territory, ""gives the Soviet Union a
firm security guarantee. ""Where are these guarantees?"" And you know what the answer was? The answer was, yes, but
that was guarantees given to the Soviet Union and you're Russia. Well, what kind of a
reaction would you expect? Last year, I think it was, making a foreign policy
speech, Putin said, ""Our mistake was that
we trusted you too much. ""And your mistake was that you tried ""to take advantage of that."" That is the situation today. Now, it may seem to you that
I'm blaming the United States, I don't want the word blame used. It was a mistaken political decision. It was not the Russians. It was this decision that
finally led to this change in Putin's attitude towards
the west and in particular, towards the United States, which is why I say how U.S. policy created Putin the way he is today. And the really, if you
will, dangerous thing is that Russian leadership,
I should be more precise and say Vladimir Putin
does not trust the West, does not trust the United States, which makes it very difficult to move away from where we are today. So something I wanna underline, so we are in now in a new
arms race, which is terrible. We are in a new Cold War
which threatens all of us. The danger of an accidental
nuclear exchange has grown. We no longer seem to fear that, there used to be demonstrations, you know, get rid of nuclear weapons,
that's not happening anymore. The possibility of a terrorist
organization somehow getting a nuclear weapon has grown. And to make it look like someone used it on each side, not the terrorists. So that I believe is something
we should all understand and finally, as someone
who works in media, I would like to say that
Russian media, Mainstream, I mean Mainstream Media,
paints America black. Russian media, Mainstream
media controlled directly or indirectly by the government shows an extremely negative
picture of the United States, U.S. policy and so on. And much to my surprise,
mainstream American media does exactly the same
thing vis-a-vis Russia. Which to me, is amazing
because this is supposed to be a free media that's
differing from the Russian one. As someone who works in Russian media, I can say it's hard to
call it a free media. There are some opposition
newspapers and radio, but that's not mainstream. They address a very
small number of people. So there we are, I think people who call themselves
journalists in my book, they're not journalists. But those people have
played and are playing a destructive role in creating
the fear, the dislike, the distrust, that the
people in both countries have vis-a-vis each other. And the fact that we don't
seem to question our media is really quite interesting. But there it is,
nonetheless, we just take it. So I'd like to wind up with
a quote from a gentleman, no, I hesitate to use the word gentleman, from a man whose name was Herman Goering. You all know who he was? There may be some people
who are too young to know. Well, he was Hitler's right hand man, and he commanded the Luftwaffe,
the German Air Force. And he was, of course, at Nuremberg, he was judged, getting
sentenced to death to hang. But he managed to get some poison, probably from the Soviets, of course, since they poison people, as we know, so as not to be hanged. But he was interviewed
by an American journalist shortly before he committed suicide. And here's what he said. And I think this is something
that we should all remember. ""Naturally, the common
people don't want war. 'Neither in Russia nor in England, ""nor for that matter in
Germany, that is understood. ""But after all, it is the
leaders of the country ""who determined the policy. ""And it is always a simple
matter to drag the people along, ""whether it is the democracy
or a fascist dictatorship, ""or a parliament, or a
communist dictatorship. ""Voice or no voice, the
people can always be brought ""to the bidding of the leaders. ""That is easy. ""All you have to do is tell them ""they are being attacked
and denounce the peacemakers ""for a lack of patriotism, ""and exposing the country to danger. ""It works the same in any country."" Said Mr. Goering. And I think he was absolutely right. And we are being led by our
media, by our politicians in that direction in both countries. I remember an ad that I
saw, a famous American actor whose name I, he starred in,
oh, gosh, so many movies, An African American, not a young, what? - [Woman] Freeman. - Freeman, yes, yes, and
he says, ""we are at war."" And he does it very well. He's a wonderful actor. But you know, he's tells you, we are at war, and we
must and dah dah dah dah. And of course, it's very scary. You know, there's nothing I can
do about that except, speak. And I speak, I'm happy
to speak here today, I do this in Russia. And I'll keep doing it as
long as I possibly can. Because there has to be some voice raised against what's happening. We're being manipulated. You know, the way Putin is portrayed. Well, he's worse than Hitler. And even Hillary Clinton,
you compared him to Hitler, this is, I'm not a Putin fan, believe me, but what's going on here? And of course, President Trump,
well, even your own press is not too positive about him, but anyway. So basically, that's what
I wanted to share with you and see I've only spoken for 45 minutes. And I would very much like to discuss, I hope you have problems,
and problems, point. (audience laughing) That was a Freudian slip, wasn't it? I hope you have questions,
I'm sure that, you know, what I've just said, in the
sense of what's happened, it can't be argued about. I mean these are facts,
but how you interpret them, that's a whole different issue. So thank you again for, for
listening and let's talk. (audience applauding) - So I am acutely aware of which one of us has more experience in
this kind of a forum. So I think I will skip
the part where I ask the first question and
open it up for questions and comments with the following
suggestions and guidelines. We have two microphones,
please wait for a microphone. You may think that you have a loud voice but the people behind you will not agree. So please wait for the microphone. Please be aware of the fact
that we have some limited time for conversation and a lot of us. So please keep your
questions reasonably brief and we'll try to keep things moving. And we'll move back and
forth from side to side. So I'm gonna start on this side. Go ahead, sir. - I'm very interested in your
take on Russian interference. The U.S. Intelligence
overwhelmingly concluded that Russia is involved in U.S. elections. And I don't think I'm
over assuming in saying that the Russians are in
favor of the Republicans. So I'm very interested
in your take on that. - Well, I think that's a you know, a question a lot of people have, I'm happy to answer as well as I can. I wouldn't say that the Russians
support the Republicans. I mean, the Russians don't really know who the Republicans are. It's not part of their daily interest or the Democrats for that matter. But, is this microphone working? - [Audience] Yes. - Okay, but it is the fact
that Republican presidents over the years have been the ones that have achieved breakthroughs
with the Soviet Union. Nixon did when Jews were allowed
to emigrate, this was 1972. Bush did, Reagan did,
while the Democratic ones such as Carter, and Clinton
had not been so successful, but that's, Russians did support, including the Russian
leadership I'm certain did support Trump. Now, look, they had a choice. Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton said
that Putin was a former KGB agent and had no soul
and compared him to Hitler. Trump said, I think I
can work with this man. I think we can do this. Now, yes, the Russians wanted him to win. And I think that's normal. Did the Russians interfere? Officially, Putin denies it. The Russians officially deny it. U.S. Intelligence,
different intelligence says, it can't furnish the exact proof but it is certain that they did. I've been reading just recently, you know, there was this huge, I
don't know how many pages, special issue in New York Times about the you know, pages and pages with wonderful illustrations that are supposed to really
prove, you know, like this. No, this kind of thing. This is journalism? Interesting, isn't it? And when you read the
article very carefully, and you ask yourself, it's not an article. This one, two, three, four with graphics, five, six, six pages
of the New York Times. And when you read it
carefully, you ask yourself, why was it published now? It's got to be a reason for this, right? I mean, this happened a while ago. What is the idea? And what you find at the very tail end is that over the past few
years in this country, the popularity of Mr.
Putin has increased by 11%. And the number of people who believe that the Russians interfered
has gone down by five. That's a good reason to
publish something like this. And this is a very
detailed, interesting story that doesn't furnish any proof. But it's very well done as
the New York Times does. This is just one. So I said this came out September 20th. The next one comes out in Time Magazine, which is October 1st,
not yet their big story on the same thing, but this is, again, the interference of the Russians. And then we have another story in the New York Times September 26. So I'm saying to myself,
wow, this is like a kind of a salvo, cannons going. And I have to ask myself,
is there a reason for this? And I would ask you, you know, why now? Does this have to do with
the midterm elections? I think it probably does. Now, did the Russians interfere? I think they probably did. I think they probably did. Was that effective? I doubt it. I very much doubt it. They didn't spend a whole
lot of money, about $100,000, which is really nothing when
you talk about the election. But they did, you know, some
interesting stuff, if you will. I believe that, to
actually think that Trump won the election because
of Russian interference, you have to be very naive for that. I mean, a farmer in Idaho was influenced by Russian propaganda? I mean, I worked in Soviet
propaganda for many years. And I'm not of the highest,
how should I say this? I mean, it's not that great propaganda. (audience laughing)
You know. It's not something I'm
proud of what I did. I mean, perhaps what I do today is because of what I did back then, you know, mea culpa. But really, was Putin the
man who said, let's do this? I don't know, I can't
say yes or no to that. I'm a journalist, give me proof. Give me proof and I'll say
yes or no, depending on that. But I think yeah, there
was probably an attempt to do it and so what? Does America ever interfere
in elections, anywhere? (audience laughing) Never?! You know, why is it okay for you and not okay for them? You know that's a question. Well, I got an answer to that from one former CIA high ranking gentleman. ""He said, well, you see,
yes, we do interfere. ""But we interfere for good,
and you interfere for bad."" So I thought, well, that's it. So that's how I answer your question. I would say, yes, I would
not exaggerate the result of that, the impact of it. And I would say that it's being
used as a political toy, ploy in this country now for
a variety of reasons. And it only really surfaced
after Hillary lost. Before that, it wasn't there. But you had to find a reason why she lost. And of course, it was
the big bad Russian bear. And that's par for the course, isn't it? Le's hear the next question. - [Man] what is your opinion of the past Trump, Putin meeting? And you think it was
for show or do you think it's actually reason trying
to better our relations. - Even if it was for show, it was good. It was good for, how should I
put this, for public feeling. At last, these two men, one
of whom is the president of the most powerful country in the world, and the other is the
president of a country that has 10,000 nuclear warheads, and may not be that powerful,
but he's very dangerous. These two men have gotten together. And that in itself is positive. Nothing was really achieved. But I would say that one
of the important thing is it seems to me that the two
men kind of like each other. And that's very important. You know, Gorbachev and Reagan, were completely different human
beings, I mean completely. But they liked each other. And they achieve some really
incredible breakthroughs when you think about it. So I think it was a good thing. I think it was a first step. Of course here, the reaction
to it was very negative. Because supposedly, well,
you know what Trump said that he trusted Putin, and that
he trusted his intelligence. So how can you trust both? They're saying opposite things. And there was a lot of talk about the fact that he lost to Putin. What did he lose? He gave Putin the opportunity to be on the same stage with him. That's true, that's true. Did that increase Putin's stature? I don't think so, I don't think so at all. And I hope that there's a next meeting, I hope there is. I hope that somehow
there will be an attempt to break out of the
situation that we're in now. I mean, I'm not again, I'm
not a big fan of Mr. Trump's. But even if he tries to do
something, the Congress, the U.S. Congress, seems hell
bent on not allowing that. And I don't know why. Now, if, if the American establishment wants regime change in
Russia, wants Putin out and someone different
in, if that is the aim of the people who run this
country, let's put it that way, that is extremely dangerous. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. Russians are living worse today than they did five years ago. The sanctions are hurting. But the average Russian is saying, we're being punished
for things we never did. This is not fair. This is the American bully,
throwing his weight around. And we'll take it, we can take it. And I think that's true. The Russians, the tougher it
is, the more tough they become. They're pretty weak when things are good. No, it's true, but when things are tough, that's when they're really, you know. And I was reading this book
by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. It's called ""The Cycles
of American History,"" and he dwells on 1850 when the, you know, there were revolutions in Europe in 1848. And there was a Hungarian Revolution. And the leader of that revolution
was a man called Kossuth. And finally, that revolution
was, and he was destroyed by the Austrians and the Russians. And so speaking in Congress,
an American senator said that the United
States should interfere. This is 1850. And Senator Hale, and
there's this quote, he said, ""the future historian might
start off his chapter about the year 1850 in
the following manner. At the commencement of this
year, the American Senate, the highest legislative body of the world, the world wisest, greatest
and most magnanimous people that ever lived or ever will live, forgetting and neglecting
the trifling local affairs, which considered their own limits, constituted themselves into
a high court and proceeded to try the nations of the earth for atrocious acts of despotism."" 1850, the idea that the
United States has the right to interfere in other countries
because they behaved badly from a U.S. or other point of view, that was from a U.S. point of view, 1850, well, then you begin to understand a lot of other things, because that's what the United States has done time and time again. But when another country does
that, that's not permissible. So in Syria, if the U.S. goes
in to protect the so called and support, the so called
moderate opposition. And the Russians go in to
support Saddam, not Saddam - [Audience] Assad. - Assad, the Americans
can do it, that's okay. The Russians can't, you know,
where's your logic here? It's a tit-for-tat thing, isn't it? So, you know, that's
pretty much in my view the answer there. That's how I look at this issue. - Is there someone over on this side? - Are we done? - No, no, pick on this side. There's a question right over here. Perhaps, if you would
also identify yourselves before you ask your question. - [Rob] Okay, my name is Rob Foreman, I work for the medical school here. I used to listen to you on
radio Moscow so (laughs). - That was a long time ago. - [Rob] See the gray hairs? - Yeah, well-- (audience laughing) - [Rob] But I'd like to frame
it a little differently. That I'm not so sure I
perceive Americans to be hating what Russia did in interfering, although America has some of that attitude that you described, but
disliking the fact that someone who is largely considered to
be an incompetent president, who does not have the interests
of this country at heart is beholden to the Russians,
even if the Russians, what they did was comparable
to the what the Americans have done in Central America
and who knows where else. And on that basis, I guess my question is A,
do you think that analysis is accurate and B, why not? If not, because I don't know
that it is so much an attack on what the Russians did
in 2016 as on the person who seems to be in the
pocket of those who did it? - Well, I would say this, it
was Kennedy who used to say, I'll say this to that, right. I will say this. What I said initially,
when I compared what Trump was saying during the
presidential campaign and what Hillary was saying, it's obvious to anyone that the Russians would support Trump, it's obvious. And Americans should understand that. Not because of what Trump stands for, not because he's a whatever
he is, not because he wants the Supreme Court to be more conservative. Russians don't care about that. They don't even, it's not
part of what they think. But they think about the
relationship between Russia and the United States. And judging from what he said, back then, their relationship could improve. And that's basically it on the one hand. On the other hand, you
recall as well as I do, how many American senators, how many political figures said that the Russians were trying
to destroy American democracy. What does that mean? How so that the aim of the Russians was to somehow destroy American democracy? There's none of that. So I can understand what you're saying. But it really is not at all. It doesn't correspond to what Mr. Putin or the majority of people in
Russia really cared about, or care about today. Today, there is much less support for Donald Trump in Russia than there was. People are asking themselves,
who the hell is this man? He comes here and he says
one thing and he goes away and says something completely different. You know, if today he says,
yes, tomorrow he says no to the same thing. So there are lots of questions. And there's kind of a, how should I put this? They don't take him too seriously anymore, except that he has enormous power. - [Alexander] My name is
Alexander, I'm an undergraduate. You touched on at the
beginning of your talk about how there's intense
American hatred in Russia. And just now you say that,
you know, most Russians would want to improve relations. Why do you think, how does
that help Putin have like, very bad relations with
America or like a bad image of Americans in Russian minds? And also, do you think that
this hatred is reciprocal, like, is there a distrust of or dislike of Russians in America? - I think the word hatred is a bit strong and I didn't use it. I said that the attitude of Russians today towards American is more negative than it was back during the
Cold War, the worst times, and I think it's mutual. And I think that that's the
result of what the politicians have said, what they've
done and what the media is doing in both countries. And I think it's an
issue of political will. Because before Gorbachev
came to power in Russia, in Soviet Union, excuse me,
the attitude was negative in this country, very
negative towards Soviet Union, and the Russians, you know, the Russians, oh, the Russians are coming (mumbles). But as soon as Gorbachev
started changing things, glasnost, perestroika,
suddenly became Gorby, he became, you know,
America's favorite guy. So I think that if there
is a desire on both sides to change that attitude, it
can be done very quickly. And that's why I say
that we're manipulated. We are manipulated. And we all say, well,
I'm totally independent. It's not true, we make our decisions, and we come to certain conclusions
because of what we read, because of what we see and
because of what we hear. So, basically, that's it. I would say that certainly
the internet allows us to get a much broader picture. In fact, we could communicate with the other side via the internet. It's not happening very
much, but it is a little bit. So that the, how should I put
this, the ordinary citizen could do a lot to change what's
happening in both countries, and it's a two way street. And I think it's people like you, that is to say of your age, they're the ones who for me,
are the reason for optimism because you can do this. Whereas people of my age
and slightly younger, can do far less. So I would hope that, you
know, what I've said today might lead you to look into this. And I don't say to anyone, believe me. Trust me, heaven forbid. Look into it. That's all I would say. - So I was struck in both your talking and now your sort of mutual
indictment of the media on both sides and I've
been curious for a while about how this may or may not be different to what this picture looked
like say in the mid 1980s. - I wonder if you could recall, so just take the New York Times. I mean, I wonder if you
could recall with you know, what New York Times reporting about Russia about the Soviet Union
was like, in the 80s. - Yeah. - And whether you see a
significant difference-- - Let me give you an example. Back in the 1970s, 1980s, all of the major television networks, which are the most powerful
in the sense of affecting back then especially
affecting people's views. All three of the major networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC had bureaus in Moscow. The head of the ABC Bureau was a woman by the name of Anne Garrels. Well, that was a rare thing
in those years for a bureau to have a woman as a chief. Not only that, but she spoke Russian and I'd like to tell you that the vast majority
of American journalists did not speak Russian, they
had interpreters, she didn't. And one day when, and I
met her at some reception, and I was doing the show that, you know, I did for Moscow radio. And we talked and she said, ""You should be on U.S. television."" I said, well, you know,
how does that happen? She called up Ted Koppel, you remember who he was right, Nightline? I hope he's not forgotten. (audience laughing) And she said, you know,
Ted, instead of having dissidents on all the time, who represent 0.0 point something of the country of the Soviet Union, Why don't you put on someone
who can can express the Soviet viewpoint and
who can do it in English. So I got on Nightline, and since I was not your typical Russian as far
as the American audience was concerned, who is this? I had great ratings and so I was on again and again and again. And then on NBC and
CBS and here and there. Today, that wouldn't happen. I was allowed to argue
the Soviet viewpoint on American television. I was allowed to do that. Ted would invite someone
from the State Department to rebut me and very often the
State Department would say, we're not gonna do this 'cause Pozner is a pain in the what sits and we don't wanna talk
to him, that's fine. Today, I would not get that possibility to be on a major network regularly. And that's what's changed. That's what's really changed. And I've come to think that
Government censorship official or not official, and so
Soviet Union was official. It was an official censor,
you have to go with your piece and the censor would read
it, stamp it, censorship. Today that doesn't exist in Russia. But of course there is
censorship when, you know, the boss says no, you can't say that or you can't print that. So, and I'm talking about
mainstream media, right? So I call that government censorship. But there's something that
I call company censorship. And it's just as effective. And what's happened with
American media much of my regret, is that what used to be independent, you know, CNN belonged to
Ted Turner and he ran it. CBS was created by William
Paley and he ran it. But gradually, many of
these very important sources were bought by larger companies. CNN, he sold it NBC, NBC was
bought by AOL, ABC by Disney. And so these very important
media, whatever organizations became part of huge
conglomerates and information was then made very different. The attitude towards what media is supposed to do changed dramatically. I asked to the group of
people, I paid for it actually, just try to find in the New York Times over the past three years, 2015, '16, '17, any positive article about Russia. One positive article, didn't find any. Not one, now I say myself,
is that isn't censorship, then what is it? I mean, there have to be people
who come to Russia and say, gee, they have good ice cream, you know, or they have great theater, and they do. And people are standing in
line for theater tickets. And that's a nice thing, right? Give a more or less accurate,
but no, it's all negative. And that's the New York Times,
let alone everything else. And it's to me, it's
terribly disappointing, because I was, you know, I
worked here for many CNBC for quite a few years until a man by the name of Roger Ailes, I don't know if you recall who that was, he killed our program
because we were too liberal. Just didn't resume the
contract, and that was that. So I know what freedom
to press is on both sides of the fence as it were. It's a different issue. So that's what I'm saying
that we in a strange way corporate censorship is just
as effective and sometimes far more sophisticated
than government censorship. - I think we're over on
this side of the room and people in the middle are also welcome to ask questions somewhere. We see a head way in the back. - Actually, you could lob the microphone. - [Rick] So, my name is Rick Schneider. I work with Rivendell Institute at Yale. - Where are you? - [Rick] Right here. - Okay, thank you. - [Rick] I'm also a visiting
professor, have been at Gimmel and currently at Bushka. - Yeah. - [Rick] So my question
is, from your discussions, experience with leaders in Russia, do you sense any room for
compromise on Ukraine? I mean, after all the, maybe the big sticking point right now in our relations is all of those sanctions,
most of the sanctions other than the Magnitsky, of course, but most of the sanctions
are about Ukraine and Donbas is a big problem. So, is there room for
compromise to fix that? - I bet, first of all,
I applaud the question because the key word is compromise. The key word is compromise. I had asked for the
possibility to show a map. Is that still possible or is
that not possible anymore? I wanna answer your question, because I wanna show something that I think is important. And I asked, oh my! (audience laughing) I asked that a map of Russia with Ukraine be put up on the screen and hopefully-- - [Technician] This will take, it'll take a couple of seconds. - I'm in no hurry, and a
map of the United States and Mexico be put up on screen. Now, let me go back to the
Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962. Two totally independent
leaders, Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro decide
that it would be a good idea for Russia to deploy
missiles on Cuban soil. Did they have the right
to make that decision? Absolutely, two independent countries, and Fidel Castro was not
a satellite, for sure. So, is that, okay. So they make that agreement. And so it's begin bringing
in them the missiles or the parts to assemble. And the United States discovers this. - [Technician] That's not the (mumbles). No, no, no. - And Kennedy says to the Russians, turn your ships around,
or we will sink them. And if that leads to
World War III, so be it. And the Russians turn their ships around. But there was a compromise. Not made public in this
country at that time. Kennedy agreed to pull
out American missiles that were deployed in Turkey in exchange, because the Russian said,
look, you have missiles in Turkey right on our border, almost. You say our missiles are
an existential threat, but so are yours. Take them out and we will not deploy ours. That was a compromise. Now, Kennedy asked that
this not be made public because it would kind of
be seen as a loss of faith and blah, blah, blah,
and it wasn't made public and then it was later. So that was a compromise. And it helped avoid World War III. Well, this is not yet happening-- - You may have to sort of ask folks to conjure in their minds. - All right, I will do that. - Yes, I think you wanted to-- - So now the Russian leadership sees NATO as an existential threat. Rightly or wrongly, that's not the point. The point is that that's
the way it's seen. And this is not politics. You know, why would you bring NATO closer and closer to
our borders, they say. In Latvia, it's on the border, in Estonia, it's on the border. Now, Ukraine is being, is moving westward, it's a complicated issue, the United States has played a certain role in
this, that's not the point. It's moving westward. If it ultimately goes
into the western fold or whatever you wanna call it, then it's logical to surmise that Ukraine will join the European Union
and will become a NATO member. Now Ukraine has a border with Russia. Not only that, but Crimea,
which was traditionally Russian, but I'm not, we can go
into the complicated thing about how Ukraine was
Russia and was (mumbles), not the point, but Sebastopol
was always the base of the Navy, the Russian Navy, naval fleet of the Black Sea. So if Crimea remains Ukrainian, and if Ukraine becomes part of NATO, the Russian fleet won't be in Sebastopol, but the American 6th Fleet might very well be there. And NATO will be on
Russia's southwest border. And the Russians see this
as an existential danger. And they say, we will not permit it. Now, does that correspond
to international law? No, it doesn't. When you talk about existential threat, you say, I don't care
about international law, as in the Cuban Missile Crisis. You say, no, we don't
give a damn how you feel. We're not going to allow this. It is my opinion that
had from the very outset, been some kind of internationally
negotiated agreement, that Ukraine would not
become a member of NATO for at least the next 50 years, there would be no Ukrainian problem. Why did I ask for a map of
the United States and Mexico? Well, the United States has a pretty large border with Mexico. Now imagine that you have
a revolution in Mexico. That's not that hard to imagine. And imagine that the
government that comes to power is not a big fan of the
United States of America. I think that too, is not
difficult to imagine. But since it's a little
bit afraid of big brother, it asks the Russians to
send over three or four or five divisions to be placed
on the U.S. Mexican border. You think the U.S. would accept that? So why would the Russians accept this? That's what it's really all about. Does there have to be a compromise? In my opinion, yes. And the compromise has to
be that Ukraine guarantees it will not become a member of NATO. And then the compromise is
that the Russians get out. We get out, but there's the guarantee. Crimea is a different issue. There could be an agreement
that let's do another referendum under international supervision. Let's see what the people of Crimea want. Do they really wanna be part of Russia or do they wanna be part of Ukraine? Or do they wanna be an
independent republic? I know that the answer
will be overwhelming. And so does everyone. Which is why no one is even
suggesting that, because the majority of the people who live in
Crimea wanna be part of Russia. It's a tradition, it's existed
that way for a long time. But basically, that's my answer. Yes, you need a compromise. And if neither side is
willing to compromise, well, then we're in deep whatever. - We're over here for the next question. (man speaks in foreign language) I can't hear you. (man speaks in foreign language) You guys speak Russian? - [Man] No, I gonna switch to English. I just wanted to greet you in Russian. I've been following you
for many years, your work. Going back to tell
Telebridges with Phil Donahue and certainly, some of
us remember those days in Washington back in the Soviet Union. I'm from Ukraine, just for the record. So I certainly share your
view about a lot of things that you speak about. Today, however, I'm
struggling a little bit to accept your point of view. And I can't get rid of a
feeling that it's almost like a legal defense
that is trying to explain the bad behavior of a person
by the external circumstances. I'm certainly not naive or
idealistic about the policymaking in any country, including
the United States. And certainly, I do agree
that mistakes were made. Not being an expert in this field, it's difficult for me to really know the exact chronological
sequence of the events. So it's difficult to
argue what was the cause and what was the effect
of what you're describing. However, in your presentation today, I think you certainly presented Mr. Putin as a positive peace loving person. And I'm not sure that I
agree with that assessment. - I don't know, I don't. - [Man] Well, you certainly brought up a number of effects that
presented him as somebody who was continuously on the
ongoing basis reaching out to the world, not just the United States, but the West was the
peace, mission in mind. However, his actions, not
just vis-a-vis, Crimea but overall, Eastern Ukraine. His pretty aggressive actions in Syria, certainly don't create that position. So I think there's a little
bit of a disconnect between, either that's the United
States or our policymakers made that, created that
image of Putin as somebody who is a not an easy person to work with? (audience applauding) But certainly his actions in many ways, not just his actions, but
also the aggressive tactics of the military, Russian
military, in a lot of his regions don't support that, that view. But to get to my question, I
think, while I generally if we, for discussion sake, agreed
to accept that the U.S. and maybe the Western
world contributed in a way to the image of Putin that you described. Putin is not only responsible
for the foreign policy of the Russian Federation, but
also for its domestic policy, and who contributed to his
image as the domestic leader of Russia as somebody who
is fairly authoritarian in the way he runs the country, thank you. - That wasn't a question
but I'll answer it. (audience laughing) I made a point of up to 2007. And up to 2007, Putin did
nothing internationally that would speak of an
aggression, nothing at all. It all happened after 2007. It happened in 2008 with
Georgia, with the war. Officially it wasn't
Putin, it was Medvedev, but you know, so no big difference. And then all the other things
that you're talking about, but up until 2007. And so that Munich speech when
he said, enough is enough, you have to respect us, you
have to take into consideration, our interest, the world is not uni polar, it is multipolar and we will
have to keep that in mind. Incidentally, that's why
he's so popular in Russia. Not because he contributed to
people's living much better although they did, but he was lucky because the price of oil was high and so that certainly helped. But because people saw him
as someone who stood up to the American bully, and told him off. And that's where his
popularity comes from. Russia is back. We're up from our knees,
as people would say. And they have to take
us into consideration. And we don't give a damn if you like us or you don't like us. But you know, Putin is our man. He is a true patriot. And that's where his strength lies. Now, if you talk about
his domestic policies, I would absolutely agree with you that A, he is authoritarian, B, he has pretty much stymied the development of democracy in Russia. I do not agree with basically almost all of his policies in Russia,
not all but almost all. I'm much more supportive
of his international views than with his domestic views. So I have no argument with you. I did not present, I don't
think I did present him as a, you know, a lover of peace. I was simply making the point
that up until a certain moment you could not really
blame him for anything. And that well, I say find it,
just point me, you know, say, well in 2006 or in 2005,
Russia did this and this, you know, I would say okay, fine. I don't know what, you know,
what are we talking about. And of course, Ukraine, with
its proximity to Russia, and have having been seen,
always as close to Russia because of the language,
because of the religion, in a way the Russians, you
know, the Rus being where Russia was born in Ukraine. So the fact that Ukraine would leave, very painful to Russians, as it would be in, you
know, in other countries, but that certainly does
not, how should I put this, that certainly does
not make Putin blame us in what's happened in Ukraine. So I have no argument with you at all. But because of the
mistakes that we're making, in my opinion that were
made, you have now a man who has a very different
outlook than he did. How many years ago now, you
know, and that's too bad. I think that there was a
huge window of opportunity. And it was missed. And it's too bad for everyone. - There's a hand right up here. - [Anastasia] Hi, my name is
Anastasia, I'm from Moscow. So I grew up in Russia,
but I've lived in the U.S. now for five years. So we've talked a lot about
Putin and how powerful he is and his international policy. But, you know, being the
Russian myself, I asked myself, is there a future for Russia? Should we hope for anything better? Should we because you
know, now, I feel like there is a big division in
terms of what people think like some people just
think Putin is everything, all we've got, and there
is no other future for us. But then, of course, with
Navalny being in the picture, and I know you're not the fan of him. - No, I'm not. - [Anastasia] But, you know,
except for him, of course, there might be someone else. But my question is, should
we hope for any improvements in terms of like for us for Russians? Should we hope for the future for Russia or should we just practice
our American accent and forget about? - Well, you know, when
you asked that question, I would have to ask what what do you mean? What would you like to change? What is it that that makes
you ask that question? And my answer to that is,
of course, there's a future. And the future is, let me
back up a little bit here. The main problem, from my
point of view in Russia, is that the leadership, all
the leadership is Soviet. All the people who are
at the head of politics and all the rest of
it, they're all Soviets. They were born in the Soviet Union. They went to Soviet schools. They were members of the Young Pioneers. They were members of the
Young Communist League. They were members of the
Communist Party, most of them. They were created, formed by a
system that no longer exists. They're trying to run a system that they really don't
know anything about. And they're not very good at it. But whatever they do, is
based on the mentality that they have. And that mentality is a Soviet mentality. And there's not much
you can do about that. That's the way they were brought up. And you can't say, well,
where are the others 'cause there are no others. And what I say is, in my
opinion, the hope is that people who are not born
in the Soviet Union, who were born afterwards, that is to say, the next generation and
the generation after that, that's when you will see real change and you have to have patience. I have no doubt that
Russia is a great country. And you know, during the worst times like the Tsar Nicholas
I, during those years, Russia's greatest literature developed. So it's not that, it's not
that you can't just look at it from that side, I certainly
hope, I won't see it. Not at my age, it's gonna
take another 20, 30 years. But in all countries,
for democracy to develop, it took over 200. And I guess there were
people back then saying, gee, do we have a future? Because there were all kinds of things. You had slavery in the United States less than 200 years ago. Come on, since you have to
look at it realistically. So my answer to you is yes,
I absolutely do believe it. But it's going to take time and you cannot do anything about that. Except that if you're young, you can look forward to a
change that is inevitable because those people will disappear. And it will be your ballgame. As a Yankee fan, I know what I'm saying. (audience laughing) - [Alec] I'm here, here, over there. - Oh, okay. - I'm a father of Yale undergrad. My name is Alec, we met 16
years ago in Kazakhstan. We spent a couple of days
in much media business. Remember that? But the question that
I have, and you know, we had very interesting
discussion 16 years ago about what made my family
move to America from Odesa. And, you know, and I actually
I saw a lot about it, and now I know my answer. But back then, I believe
I told you the story about my father who really, you know, after the conflict and Transnistria that was 100 kilometers from Odesa, when people all of a sudden
started killing each other. You know, geopolitics, yeah,
we all understand that. Tit for tat, we understand that. You know, the United States
and Mexico, Russia and Ukraine, Southern border, NATO
fleet and Sevastopol, we all understand that. But with people going and
killing each other right now in Donetsk in 10 years, people who
lived on same street, it's not even Karabakh,
it's not like even Armenians and Azerbaijanis, we have
some ethnic conflicts, right? They have some, you know,
religious differences. But whatever is going
on in Donbas right now when neighbors killing
neighbors over nothing, I mean, do you really
think that that whole issue of Ukrainian language is
like really pressing there. Or these stories that were made up about, you know, Western Ukrainians,
Banderas, you know, Nazis was gonna move in,
who's gonna, you know, how do we stop that? How do we stop people
from killing each other in situations like
that, because, you know, they can meet up in Minsk,
they can do whatever, you know, they can make agreements. They can disagree, you
know, better than me about, you know, money interest and kleptocracy that is so omnipresent in Russia and Ukraine, and everywhere. But how do we stop that? How do we stop? How can United States and
Germany and Russia get together and stop brothers from killing brothers? - Well, you know, if I had the answers to all of those things, I probably would be in a different job. No, seriously, I mean, I
can't tell you how to solve the world's problems. And, you know, people
are killing each other, in many places in Africa, for instance, brother's killing brother and so on. And this is going on everywhere. But I would say that if the
leaders of Russia, of Ukraine, of the United States, of Germany, we're actually asking that question. That question they were asking. I think they'd find a way to answer it. But I don't think they're
asking that question. I think they're asking
very different questions. And they have very different aims. And that's why this is going on. So, to me, the answer is pretty obvious. How you make people do that, that's a different question. Why is it that egoistic
geopolitical interests take first place over these things. That's the real question. And when you say we understand, I don't know who you're talking about. Most people don't even know,
you know, in this country, where Georgia is for instance,
except the state of Georgia. Most people are really
really and in Russia too, the level of knowledge is lower than the doorstep as they say. So there is no effort and
the media does not play that game at all. It doesn't say, how do we stop? It says they are to blame. And that's it, and on both sides. So I think the only way to
stop it is for us to talk, make our voices heard. And that's not easy. And sometimes it's dangerous. But again, if you know, did I ever, no, of course not. There was a guy by the name,
his last name was Niemöller, he is a German who fought
during World War I, he was the youngest Japanese,
U-boat commander or U-boat, as they were called, submarines. And when Germany lost the war,
he was totally crushed by it. And he became a priest,
Protestant priest in Hamburg and very anti war. And as he went up the ladder
as it were, Hitler did too. And Hitler became the head of
Germany and he became the head of the Protestant church in
Hamburg at the same time. And he spoke out against war. And finally he was arrested, and he was sent to a concentration camp. But he survived. And when he came back, he wrote a book. And in that book, there's a
passage that I know by heart, because I think it's one
of the most important and powerful things I've ever heard. He wrote, ""When they came for the Jews, ""I didn't say anything,
because I'm not Jewish. ""And when they came for the communists, ""I didn't say anything,
because I'm not a communist. ""And when they came to
the trade union members, ""I didn't say anything,
because I'm not a member ""of the trade union. ""And when I came for the Catholics, ""I didn't say anything
because I'm not a Catholic. ""And when they came for me,
there was no one to speak."" And I feel that, I very
much feel that way. If we don't speak out, however we can, and not irresponsibly, and not
to say oh, look look at me, but rather with this understanding that it's our human duty to do this, well, then we keep saying,
well, they should do it. That's, it's certainly very Russian. They should do it. And if they don't, then what? So that's really, that's my view. And it's an idealistic view, perhaps, but that's the way I look at it. - [Anastasia] Okay, hi, I'm here. So my name is-- - (mumbles) to the left.
- Here. Coincidentally, I'm also
Anastasia from Moscow. (audience laughing) Lots of us here, I'm
a PhD student at Yale. So you started your talk by
outlining to strategists, the U.S. could have taken
towards the Soviet Union-- - Towards Russia. - Towards Russia, after
the Soviet Union collapsed, and presented this as a
cornerstone of the situation we have right now. - Yeah. - So if we hypothesize with your knowledge of Russian politics, economy,
you know, the Soviet mentality that you mentioned, do you
believe that some version of Marshall Plan could
have ever changed anything? - Well, you know, that's
a question that regardless of how I answer, I can't prove
it 'cause it didn't happen. So it's kind of as you say,
it's very hypothetical. But do I think that that
would have been better than what they did? Yes, clearly, clearly, it
would have been better. To what extent it would
have succeeded, who knows? I don't know. But I do know that when
Gorbachev announced Glasnost, the media in Russia changed dramatically. And I think nobody would argue with that. Dramatically overnight, it
became a different kind of media. During the Soviet times,
40 million people tuned into the Voice of America in Russian, The BBC World Service in Russian, the Deutsche Welle in Russian, because they were not getting
in their own media information that they were getting
on these wave, you know, and the Russians tried to block that. The Soviet government did,
spent trillions of rubles, trying to block them but
people listened nonetheless. As soon as Glasnost came,
and they stopped listening, they were getting it
from their own source. They were getting the
information, people know exactly when they're getting any when they're not. Or usually they do. So that's one example of
how quickly things change. So I do think that had
there been this attitude, let's help them. Let's help them become democratic. I do think that it would
have been a positive, the result would have been positive. I can't tell you how positive. So that's, you know,
my hypothetical answer to your hypothetical question. - I think we have two more, time for two more questions,
perhaps, over here. - [Acia] Thank you, my name is Acia. I'm from Yerevan, Armenia
right there on the map. - Well-- - [Acia] Yeah, it is tiny,
but it's still there. - You see it over there, right. That tiny little country
that says Armenia? - [Acia] Yes. - Okay. - [Acia] So I'm a doctoral
student and I study genocides, but today I'm going to ask-- - You study what? - [Acia] Genocides. - Wow! - [Acia] yeah, a lot of fun. But today, I'm going to ask a question about current developments that happened right next door to Russia, and are very connected to what you talked, about speaking out the new
generation that can change, the generation that maybe
does not have this Soviet mentality can change or may be the change. - Yeah. - And something like that
recently happened in Armenia, no one ever expected that
peaceful demonstrations in such a tiny post
Soviet landlocked country could lead to change, which was
the collapse of the old rule and establishment of the government, which is totally and fully
supported by the people. - Yeah. - And the funny question
that I always hear when I discuss this with
students or at conferences, is how come Russia did not intervene into these developments in any way? And I would really appreciate
your opinion in this, like, how come that Vladimir
Putin did not really respond in any visual way to this development? And how was this even or was it observed, seen in Russia because it was next door. It was a big change. And some people were even
speculating how this could serve as an example for other countries to topple their governments,
et cetera, thank you. - Well, one reason might be that perhaps Putin isn't quite the man you all think he is. You know, that's a possibility, I'm not insisting on it. Another reason might be that
the new leader of Armenia, never expressed any
anti Russian sentiment. On the contrary, said we are
in an independent country, but look where we are. And we've always had very
close ties with Russia and we wanna have close
ties, economic ties. There was no absolutely no
sense of enmity on the contrary, And it was the people, there
was no doubt at this time, that was the people who spoke out. You know, Armenia is really
a very small country. What's the population now? Three million, and there was a
million people that came out. Can you imagine 30% of
the entire population comes out in the streets. You can't ignore that. And that's another reason. But the very question,
why didn't Putin interfere reflects the way people think about it. Because that's the way it's been depicted. So, you know, that's my
answer, incidentally. Well no, I'm not gonna go into that. One more question you say. - I think one more, yeah,
we'll try to wrap up by six. So we're back on this side. I see a hand right next to you. Hello, you. - [Woman] Hi, I'm a
master's student in European and Russian studies. I guess my question is about the poisoning in the UK earlier this year. (audience laughing) - Finally, finally. - [Woman] Is there a way for
us to respond to that strongly that doesn't escalate, the kind
of confrontational paradigm? - Yeah, you know, when this
took place, in Salisbury, I was shocked and I tried to figure out for myself some kind of logic. Now, you know why, who
would do this and why. Now, you know, let's
forget about the child, I means she's, you know, she didn't do anything. Skripal, he was a military agent, right? He worked for the former
GRU, not for the KGB, Putin work to the KGB,
he works for the GRU, which is military intelligence, and they can't stand the KGB, and the KGB can't stand
their intelligence. That's normal competition. So, and he betrayed his country. Let's face it, right. He went over to the other
side and began to work for British intelligence. And he was caught, and he was tried. And he was sentenced to 13 years. Now, I don't know if you're
familiar with what happens to spies, who to turn
against their own country, and are then caught? Well, in wartime, they're shot. But in peacetime, well,
it's usually something like 30 years, 25, 13 is a weird sentence. Not only does he get this
rather short sentence, considering, but he's
exchanged for Soviet, excuse me, Russian spies who were caught. Now if he was exchanged that means that he really didn't know
anything at that point. He was no danger to the Russian side. So, you know, let him go
and we'll get ours back. Now, Putin doesn't like traiters, who does? If Putin wanted to kill him, he was in prison, he could do it. And you could say that
he had a heart attack or that he committed suicide or whatever. He was no problem killing
when he was in jail in Russia. They let him go, they exchanged him, they could have exchanged someone else, they exchanged him. What sense would it
make to poison this man under those circumstances,
I mean logically. Putin is anything but stupid. Not stupid, it's very risky. The risk of somehow this being
found out is always there. Why do it, this is not a dangerous person. He can't do anything. He can talk about what
he knows, but it's over. So I try to find, I'm not
saying he didn't do it. I'm saying I'm trying to
find some kind of logic, logic, not emotions, logic as
to why Putin would be involved in something like that. Alright, it's not Putin. It's one of those lower, you
know, one of the GRU people who think that Putin would
like it if they did it. But would Putin like it
if it was discovered? No, of course not, they get
their head chopped down. So why would they risk it? They're not gonna get
decorations for doing it. Because if Putin had ordered it, then yes. So why would they do it? So to me, it really remains a mystery. Because it's stupid,
it's counterproductive. It doesn't do anything positive at all. So am I denying anything? I'm not denying, I'm saying give me proof. Please, just show me, yes, there it is. Now this interview, did you see it? The interview of Rita, what's her name? Sonya, of those two two people. Did you see it? It was one of the most unprofessional pieces of work that I've ever seen. (audience laughing) That was just, you know,
I thought what, who, why? And it happened, you
know, the day before that Putin had said these two
men should go to the media and so they come the next
day, they're there, you know. It's laughable except
that it's not, not really. So I would say to you that
whole story is disgusting. I find it hard to believe
that Putin initiated it, I really do, but somebody did. There's no doubt about it. And now I've heard a really nice story. You know that Mr Skripal in Britain, every time he'd meet with his
handlers, as they call them, he would be paid a
certain amount, not a lot, you know, 5,000 pounds or 7,000 pounds, where if he felt he had something really interesting to say, 10,000 pounds. But again, he was of no real interest. So I'm thinking, and now
this is John le Carré, right? I'm thinking, British intelligence
gets together and says, we don't need this guy,
and he's costing us money. And he's not kidding. Now, why don't we, and make
it look like it's Putin. Well, that's brilliant chap,
you should do this, you know. So British intelligence poisons the guy, and the whole thing works this way. It's not impossible. I kind of laughed at myself
when I came up with that one. And I'd like to talk to Mr.
le Carré and see how he thinks. Incidentally, if you've not
read his last two books, ""The Pigeon Tunnel,"" which is
a story of his life as a spy. And the other one I
forgot, ""Legacy of a Spy."" He writes with total disgust
about that profession that he was in for so long. I mean, really. So, you know, there it is. My answer to you is, I just don't know. It's such a weird thing, it really is. I see no reason for it. It's just invading another
country I can explain, right. But this I don't know. It makes no sense. One day, we'll know the real thing. Oh incidentally, Salisbury, I don't know if you've ever been there. I was there, I shot a
documentary about England. And so, you know why I went
there, not because the steeple is I don't know, how many
feet high or something. I have no idea. It's a beautiful,
beautiful church actually. But it's because they have
their one of the three original copies of the Magna Carta. And that's the beginning of
real democracy in the West, if you don't count the ancient Greeks, and I really wanted to see it. And they brought it out. And I can't tell you what, you
know, when you look at that. And you say, what was it 1215 
and they were already saying you can't put a man in
prison without proving that he's committed a crime. And you have all the kings
and queens and all of that. It's amazing, that's why I went there. These guys didn't even
know it was there, right? They went to see the
steeple, I mean, come on. - All right-- - Let me thank everyone
for listening to me. (audience applauding) (gentle music)"

extraneous material and questions for the record subject to the length limitation of the rules to insert something in the record please have your staff email the previously mentioned address or

themselves and please remember to mute yourself after you finish speaking consistent with house rule staff will only mute members as appropriate when they are not under recognition to eliminate background noise i see that we have a quorum and i now recognize myself uh for opening remarks um and so let me say uh i'm very very grateful for having this hearing grateful for chairman meeks a very aggressive leadership over the last several weeks to take on the the issues that the administration is debating internally and it's in these critical formative months as we've all made clear democrats and republicans our job is not to support a particular administration although many of us are very supportive of what president biden is trying to do our job is to look under the hood to advise to provide oversight and that's why we're here today i think we all remember um almost exactly a year ago we had secretary pompeo before us we were supposed to be talking about strikes in iraq but many of us were concerned that the us government wasn't taking seriously enough the uh looming crisis of uh the cobia pandemic so that became the focus of our hearing since then our country has been hit tremendously hard our focus as a country has turned inward on saving american lives on healing the american economy on rebuilding american supply chains and yet the the coba pandemic is perhaps the most obvious example in any of our memories of why the united states is connected to the rest of the world why we have to be a leader in the world the virus came from somewhere else the virus does not respect borders um and it is an incontrovertible fact that we the american people are not going to be safe unless and until everyone in the world is safe because if this virus is raging in africa and asia and latin america and in europe we know that there will be new variants even if we are all vaccinated we will be at risk so beyond the moral obligation that we have there is a strong practical need to try to make sure that we're doing our part to help others now reports suggest that the united states has secured enough doses of the vaccine to vaccinate twice our target population um but europe has purchased 2.3 billion vaccines for a population of 450 million more than twice the need um so that's something that we want to explore here today obviously we've had to secure security for ourselves public health for ourselves first but if we given the self-interest and the moral obligation to ensure that the pandemic is being crushed everywhere how can we best use the supply that we have secured to do that good news is the united states is back in a leadership role in this effort we are supporting kovacs um we are leading not retreating from international institutions we are not going to be ceding leadership of the who for example to china i think that's a very good thing and um i think we have a chance to use this crisis as an opportunity to remind the world that the united states of america that our people in our leadership cares about human life everywhere in some cases we may even care about human life more than the governments of the people whose lives are being threatened um that is an opportunity to reassert american moral and strategic leadership that i hope we will seize um now um pursuant to uh the notice we we will be meeting today to hear from distinguished witnesses who will give us their assessment of the international impacts of the kobit 19 pandemic uh and what the united states uh all of us should be doing about it and to kick us off i will now recognize representative andy barr for his remarks thank you mr chairman for holding this hearing a little more than 15 months ago we first began to see reports coming from muhan china about a new sars-like virus the reports were troubling and experts around the world began to express concerns about the virus spreading but we were assured by authorities within the chinese communist party the virus was not transmissible from human to human a sentiment echoed publicly by the world health organization of course we now know that behind closed doors the ccp was doing everything it could to cover up the virus they were silencing doctors and arresting journalists who dared to tell the world the truth while destroying samples and shutting down labs who are racing to discover what this novel virus meant for the world and as the republican committee report on the origins of the kobit 19 discovered the ccp never actually warned the who of the outbreak as required by the international health regulations because of the ccp's cover-up and the who's deference to the ccp it took weeks weeks that were critical in stopping the spread of the virus for the truth to come out now a little more than a year after the who finally declared a pandemic we face a worldwide death toll of 2.6 million people including 535 000 right here in america those numbers demonstrate the heartbreaking impact felt because of this virus and the devastating effect of the ccp's cover-up but these numbers sadly only show the surface of the true fallout from kobit 19. the economic political and physical ramifications of the virus is put in countries and regions that were already considered fragile at risk of further destabilization we've already seen a rise in food insecurity extreme poverty and increased deaths from other diseases like hiv aids tb and malaria and as this virus spreads chaos and fear authoritarian regimes terrorist groups and hostile nation states will try to take advantage the u.s has been a leader in providing global health and development assistance for decades and now congress has provided over 15 billion dollars to help control the spread of this deadly disease and mitigate its long-term impact we cannot truly bring an end to this pandemic here at home without fighting the pandemic overseas and i support funding for global efforts to combat covid19 that's why i was so frustrated the foreign affairs committee was shut out of the reconciliation process especially when leader hoyer assured us this process would be bipartisan and involve all relevant committees this disenfranchisement of our committee members is not the way we were supposed to operate in congress a partisan rush to pass even though this is a bipartisan issue was prioritized over a sound policy process and without our committee's input we abdicated critical oversight responsibilities i would laugh i would like to ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from ranking member mccall and ranking member reese that was sent to secretary blinken urging rigorous oversight of the 10 billion dollars provided through the american rescue plan these funds must be implemented with clear us government branding and spent only when we see additional money from other donors especially with skyrocketing domestic needs it is critically important that every dollar is targeted strategic and effective there is hope on the horizon however more and more vaccines are being distributed every day u.s companies thanks to operation warp speed have created an astounding three vaccines in record time it's truly historic over 71 million americans have received at least one dose worldwide that number tops 225 million increasingly our private sector has played a significant role in helping small and medium businesses survive the pandemic including by connecting them with new markets abroad cooperation between governments ngos medical experts and the private sector is the key to an effective response again i want to thank the chairman for this hearing and thank our panel for joining us today we look forward to your testimony and examining the international impact on cobia 19 and with that mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time thank you representative r i now yield one minute each to the chair and ranking member of the subcommittee on africa global health and global human rights for their remarks chair bass you're now recognized share one ambassador you there i don't see you so if uh if if you're not here then um let's go to ranking member smith for one minute and he may not be there either um let us move then to uh to our witnesses dr sheesh jah is a physician health policy researcher and currently the dean of the brown university school of public health he's recognized globally as an expert on pandemic preparedness and response and has led research and policy advice around ebola currently on the national and international copit 19

global sustainability at united parcel services previously she worked for citigroup and global government affairs overseeing the various legislative and regulatory issues that arose after the 2008 financial crisis penny started her career at the department of commerce conducting anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations on foreign companies so why don't we uh go to uh doctor john police first great so chairman owski ranking member barr members of the committee um it is my honor to be here with you today um we are more than a year into this global pandemic that has infected and killed so many people around the world and there are many lessons from this pandemic but here's one essential lesson we live in a deeply interconnected interdependent world and an outbreak anywhere can quickly become an outbreak everywhere and here's the second lesson we are now entering an age of pandemics global disease outbreak breaks will become more common why several factors including deforestation climate change broader economic development and globalization but before we focus on future pandemics let's talk about how we get through this one and to get through this pandemic we must first understand its global impact that's why i'm so pleased that this committee is holding this hearing today here at home the pandemic has been devastating but i believe we are finally turning the corner we have seen steep declines in infections and deaths as millions of americans are getting vaccinated this is terrific but we aren't done we still have challenges ahead of us variants now make up as much as half of all infections in the u.s the actions we take now particularly to accelerate vaccinations and maintain public health measures is is critical let me be clear about this it is essential that we maintain basic public health measures until every high-risk person who wants a vaccine gets one i suspect that will happen sometime around mid to late april after that we can safely begin to relax public health measures and get back to our lives globally the picture is different the covet 19 pandemic has had a profound negative effect on the world while officially 120 million people have been infected most estimates suggest that the true number of infections is probably well over a billion people and while the official death toll is 2.6 million the real death poll death toll is substantially higher than that but the impact of this pandemic certainly goes well beyond health the imf estimates that the global economy has seen the greatest decline since the globe since the great depression and of course the pain of that economic decline has been disproportionately borne by the world's poor with hundreds of millions of people thrown back into poverty after years of gains we have seen education disrupted not just here in the u.s but across the globe and it has hit poor children particularly hard for them education is the ticket out of poverty at the peak of school closures last april the estimates are that 94 of children around the world were out of school and the pandemic has harmed our political systems as well freedom house reports that pandemic has worsened democracy and human rights in 80 countries we've seen increases in authoritarian behaviors from leaders around the globe we need a vigorous multi-pronged multilateral approach to bring this pandemic to an end by vaccinating a large majority of the world now the landscape for global vaccination is complicated kovacs is one major entity trying to get vaccines out to low and middle income countries but individual nations are sending their vaccines to other countries before vaccinating their own citizens practicing what's called vaccine diplomacy the two biggest leaders of vaccine diplomacy are russia and china kovacs estimates that it will have about 2.2 billion doses by the end of 2021. that is not enough we need a strategy to vaccinate every high-risk person in the world quickly and i believe every willing adult by the end of 2021 that's probably close to 5 billion people or the equivalent of 10 billion doses that's an ambitious agenda how do we get there so congress has allocated four billion dollars to kovacs i think that's a great start but the biggest problem actually isn't money it's the vaccines and the need to substantially expand vaccine production that's why i was heartened to see the recent efforts by the administration to bring mark in to make j j vaccines we need to continue to push on expanding vaccine production and we need to fight vaccine nationalism and we need to work with countries on other aspects of fighting the pandemic such as greater availability of testing ppe and other critical materials a year ago we as a nation walked away from who in the middle of a global pandemic this harmed our national interests and allowed china to step in and play a bigger global role but it still left a global leadership vacuum rejoining who funding kovacs are all good starts but we must do more to bring this pandemic to an end and because as i said earlier we are entering an age of pandemics we must build the surveillance systems the health systems and the resiliency needed to respond more effectively to future health crises thank you so much for having me and i uh yield back sorry i was muted thank you so much um let's uh now go to mr boichi thank you chairman malinowski ranking member barr and the other distinguished members of this committee i'm honored and grateful for this opportunity to testify the topic i will address today is the global inequity in covid19 vaccine distribution and the importance of u.s leadership in resolving it my remarks will proceed in three parts i'll give an overview of the current us engagement on this problem a summary of the three emerging circumstances that would justify increased u.s engagement and last a proposal for a u.s led initiative to increase the capacity transparency and resilience of vaccine manufacturing to produce sufficient quantities of vaccines and related materials in this and future pandemics let's start with current u.s engagement so the largest vaccination campaign in world history is underway but many nations remain excluded from its benefits four months into the global rollout of uh the coveted vaccines approximately 400 million doses have been administered globally but just 10 nations are responsible for three out of four of every dose administered 75 countries representing approximately a billion people have yet to administer a single dose of vaccine uh in efforts to bridge this global gap between vaccine haves and vaccine have nots the united states and other wealthy democracies so far have opted to donate funds rather than early supplies of doses in february uh 2021 g7 nations pledged 7.5 billion to the multilateral initiative known as kovacs uh this congress generously uh appropriated four billion uh for this purpose including 2.5 billion that will go to vaccine procurement kovacs is committed to distributing 2 billion doses by the end of the year but progress has been slow especially relative to the vaccine rollout in wealthy nations as of march 15 kovacs has shipped 29 million vaccine doses to 46 countries widespread immune immunization remains a distant prospect in most nations the african union doesn't expect to vaccinate sixty percent of the continent's population for at least three years it is understandable that democratic leaders answerable to voters opted have opted to give cash rather than share early vaccine supplies at a time wherein each dose provided abroad is one less dose available at home but three circumstances that have emerged that increase the u.s interest in global production and distribution of coven 19 vaccines and related supplies the first is the aggressive diplomacy being practiced by china russia and other autocracies around these vaccines many countries that were unable to compete with wealthier nations for advanced vaccine purchases were unwilling to wait for kovacs to deliver have turned to unproven chinese and russian vaccines china is currently donating vaccines to 43 nations russia to 13 uh india to 40 and then there's a handful of smaller donations by four other nations most of these donations are small amounts china and india are pledging on average fewer than 300 000 doses per country russia is providing donations ranging from 60 doses to 500 000 doses keep in mind all the pledged vaccines require a two dose regimen these donations are not being directed to the nations where the coronavirus crisis is currently the most severe and where early doses may do the most good 42 out of 43 of the countries to which china is donating are participants in its belt and road initiative russians donations are being directed through oligarchs and russian firms yet at a time when governments are under extreme domestic pressure to roll out vaccines and they have few alternative countries will remember who came to their assistance and when and where vaccine donations are going it is possible that increased influence for china and russia may follow the second circumstance uh is the emergence of variance the only effective uh strategy for reducing the risk of more contagious deadly variants potentially more deadly variants is reducing new infections which will require increasing us and global vaccination rates and making more vaccines there is already a finite supply of manufacturing capacity and supplies that will be put under greater strain if we need to produce the next generation of vaccine candidates to protect against emerging variant strains the third circumstance i'll just briefly know note is the emergence of supply shortages and disruptions uh kovit has placed an enormous strain on manufacturing capacities and supplies under manufacturer delays and delivering promise doses and shortages of raw materials single-use components and vaccine-related supplies in response to those shortages the eu uh india the us and others have imposed export restrictions they are hindering the ability of covax to deliver doses around the world they also threaten to hinder the production of the billions of vaccines we need for other infectious diseases like polio diphtheria tetanus and so forth the us needs a three-part strategy to respond uh to this challenge the first yes sir i'm uh we probably don't have time for a three-part strategy because uh your initial five minutes is up but but i'm sure you can work it into the questions that i know we will throw your way so um i am going to exercise my uh absolute power as uh as temporary chair to uh to call on uh ms mckenna for five minutes uh and then we will come back to uh the important themes that have already been raised thank you thank you thank you very much vice chair malinowski representative barr ranking member mccall and the other distinguished members of this house foreign affairs committee for convening preparing i would like to submit my written statement for the record uh certainly without attraction thank you my name is jada dorian mckenna and i am the executive officer of mercy corps an international humanitarian and development organization our global team of 5 600 humanitarians operates in 40 countries where our work improves the lives of more than 37 million people when coven 19 hit our team members redoubled their efforts to support communities in need despite travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and limited funding we adapted our programs to continue providing life-saving relief and critical development programs we helped communities from western nigeria to kandahar province to protect themselves against covid19 i hope you will join me in recognizing the courage of those in the ngo sector working on the front lines of this crisis around the world the effects of covid19 are threatening hard-won development gains by exacerbating food insecurity poverty gender inequality and violence these trends have the potential to be equally or more deadly than the virus itself the same inequities the pandemic has magnified here in the united states are playing out abroad but whether in south sudan or yemen the communities are bereft of social safety nets or federal stimulus support barely anyone can work from home in the communities that we as mercy corps serve hunger is on the rise due to income loss market disruptions movement restrictions and a dramatic increase in food prices the world food program now estimates that 271.8 million people are acutely food insecure or directly at risk of becoming so because of the pandemic this is an 82 percent spike from this time last year the world bank reports that covet 19 will push 115 million people into extreme poverty the first time in two decades that that metric has increased cobin 19 is exacerbating global conflict at every level in many places government responses to covert 19 are fraying community trust and authorities there has been a proliferation of misinformation enabling armed groups to expand their influence according to one forecast 13 countries are likely to experience new conflicts in the next two years due to the pandemic on march 18 2020 one in every 45 people globally needed humanitarian assistance in production today one in every 33 people globally need aid to survive that is a 235 million people total a 40 increase over last year u.s global leadership is urgently needed to meet these unprecedented crises first i thank congress for providing international assistance in the american rescue plan i urge this committee to ensure that usaid and the state department obligate these resources expeditiously need will continue to outpace assistance i encourage this committee to support increases to the humanitarian development and conflict prevention accounts in the state and foreign operations appropriations bill in fiscal year 2022 focusing in particular on long-term development investments to help communities endure future shocks u.s diplomatic action is urgently needed to galvanize global giving and to ensure that other governments and the private sector step up to do their part second i urge the u.s government to build on its recent contribution to the covid19 vaccine access facility affectionately referred to as covax by many of us by supporting equitable global vaccine access this will require a diplomatic push with local governments to ensure that excluded communities are engaged and participate in local vaccine rollouts lastly this committee should ensure the u.s government takes action to prevent the rise in violence that drives humanitarian need and undermines development in 2019 congress passed the global fragility act a law that originated on a bipartisan basis in this committee to strengthen the u.s government's approach toward conflict prevention i encourage you to ensure the global fragility act is implemented and funded thank you very much thank you so so much for uh for that testimony and then finally we will go to ms nas for her five minutes thank you thank you good afternoon vice chairman and members of the committee my name is penny nass and i'm here representing united parcel service ups thank you for having me here today i will focus on how ups has been involved in global pandemic efforts the ongoing vaccine rollout and in supporting an inclusive economic recovery and in all cases our belief in the value of public-private partnerships i would like to start by recognizing and honoring the 540 000 front line workers of ups whose hard work and perseverance has been inspiring i am thankful for their service this committee i want to share my gratitude to you and your commitment to international assistance and the role you play to advance u.s leadership and protect u.s interests while also doing good for us at ups the last year has brought a new purpose and commitment to the motto we live by moving our world forward by delivering what matters with both pride and responsibility our company has played an essential role in every stage of the global response to covid beginning in february of last year we were engaged in supporting government emergency responses and in the u.s we partnered with fema to support project air bridge which sourced and distributed much-needed mass gowns and gloves to healthcare workers globally we mirrored these public-private partnership models with many countries in support of their emergency response plans including the philippines singapore the netherlands and much of africa with the support of international leadership from the g7 our industry was designated an essential service and our fleet of drivers and pilots continue to deliver essential goods to those in need globally of course our delivery volume was also a lifeline for people at home delivering items from medicines to school materials to hair cutting tools and we also saw a glowing reliance of our customers the retailers on digital engagement and e-commerce sales changes which will very likely endure long past the pandemic now today ups is focused on moving the covet 19 vaccines and ancillary surprise since the first shipment in december 2020 our network has delivered over 93 million doses to more than 46 countries moving vaccines is complex with expedited movement in cold and ultra cold chain custody with strict adherence to security regulatory and authenticity protocols it is a highly sophisticated and data-enabled process but this complexity is not a barrier to vaccine equity ups health care and the ups foundation are moving quickly to support delivery programs that meet the needs of the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations in collaboration with kovacs gabby the vaccine alliance and care ups will initially facilitate the delivery of 20 million doses for countries that have not had sufficient access to vaccines including for top priority groups like healthcare workers the role of public-private partnerships is a vital component in building global solutions for global challenges ups goes beyond our traditional services in making these arrangements work for everybody providing in-kind logistics expertise to ngos to manage and streamline deliveries we also provide end-to-end cold chain transportation services and donate ultra low temper temperature freezer capacity needed to maintain vaccine viability one example is the work we have done with gabby and unison hey david virtual viewing and discussion i'm sorry everybody mute please one example is work we have done with gavin unicef to transport the ferc's covax shipment of vaccines in africa in ghana working with ghana's ministry of health we work to transport vaccines to dosing sites using zipline a drone logistics company which the ups foundation helped finance in 2019 to rule areas lacking cold chain storage this partnership has delivered more than 12 000 doses to rural ghana and allows vaccines to go from facility to destination in as little as 15 to 30 minutes with no impact on temperature last in looking to the future ups has continued to focus on keeping our commercial customers in business at ups we are particularly focused on making sure this recovery effort reflects our company's values of inclusion and we are working to help our micro small and medium sized customers as world bank and oecd studies reveal women have experienced a disproportionate economic impact from the pandemic and so we have pivoted to help address the specific needs of women entrepreneurs and small business owners via our women's exporter program quickly developing training courses to support them and help them to pin it to the online retail environment we've partnered with governments and international institutions such as the international trade center which has enabled six thousand women and small business owners to continue operating around the world in 2020 indicating again the power of public-private partnerships which can have a far and impactful reach if structured effectively so in conclusion of the many lessons we count today in our reflection of covid's impact on the world there is no doubt that the focus the pandemic has brought to cooperation of stakeholders particularly when the private sector and governments can work together should be among the changes that we reflect on and preserve thank you for the opportunity to testimony testify and i look forward to your questions thank you thank you all for uh your testimony i will now recognize members for five minutes each and pursuant to house rules all time yielded is for the purposes of questioning our witnesses i'll recognize members by committee seniority alternating between democrats and republicans if you miss your turn please let our staff know and we'll do our best to come back to you you seek recognition you must unmute your microphone and address the chair verbally and identify yourself so that we know who is speaking um we will begin the questioning with representative sherman thank you mr chair uh our committee or should i say the asia subcommittee was the first to have hearings on the uh coved uh crisis and as we mo move and i commend mr bear i believe that was his first as a chair of the asia subcommittee and as we move forward we need to appropriately criticize the chinese communist party while protecting and embracing the aapi community in the united states now mr barr in his opening statement um blames the chinese communist party for hiding key facts about this disease and i might be add that the chinese communist party uh has not allowed the kinds of investigation that would allow us to determine whether this came from the virology lab in wuhan or whether it came from an animal source they have covered up they have concealed and it's my experience in life that the innocent are less likely to hide evidence than the guilty we may never know exactly where this virus came from and the chinese communist party should pay the full um reputational cost to how they mishandled this in its early months but blaming the who for believing china and the chinese government ignores two key facts first the who has no source of information not under the control of the chinese communist party they and we do we have the most expensive intel uh system and i think the best in the history of the world and we didn't have to take what china said at face value but unfortunately we did and one thing we have to uh determine is whether our intel community failed to tell us what was happening in muhan or whether the leadership we had at the time uh failed to listen to the intel community uh as uh mr malinowski points out we have a strong interest in preventing this disease from spreading worldwide moral uh a moral interest and interest in world leadership our economy requires trading partners and as he points out uh uh wherever this disease spreads it can mutate and come back to us in a in a in a worse form um there are those who say that we've failed because we didn't give up vaccine that we needed to other countries there are other failures that are far less defensible well one of those is that it took us many many months to get uh companies that didn't develop the vaccine to start making the pfizer and modern vaccine and to get that license only after months of pounding by me and others did our country did we finally get those licenses second with regard to these vaccines we told people uh administering them get five dosages out of the bottle and then throw the bottle away well there's six and a half dosages in that bottle now we waste about one dosage per bottle because if there's half a dosage left in the bottle uh we throw it away rather than getting some out of this bottle and somehow the next bottle the same manufacturing lot uh but finally uh we have failed to do the dosage studies necessary in order to get these disease these vaccines approved as quickly as possible uh they only tried one dosage here's a lot of evidence that that dosage is double or triple uh the number of milligrams necessary especially if the person you're immunizing is under age 55. yet even dr fauci has refused and has said we don't need to do any more research on this because it won't help america we won't get the results until the summer and by then we'll have enough vaccine for america uh uh mr dr ja are you aware of any studies in the world where we're seeing whether a much lower dosage of these very valuable vaccines can provide uh immunization at least to those under age 855. uh congressman thank you for your question um we are doing it in children uh in the united states but in terms of adults i think there are many of us who have called for studying the lower dose of these vaccines for exactly the reasons you've outlined i'm not aware that those studies are happening yeah and the other thing is that while uh manufacturing capacity in the u.s is now being used under license uh are there is there manufacturing capacity in india or elsewhere that could help make more of these valuable vaccines but don't have licenses from the united states so is that a question for me yes that is okay sorry sir um yeah so that this is the issue in front of us is how do we expand manufacturing capacity uh we are there's a lot of manufacturing capacity that is being used india has got a lot of capacity but it's to be used for astrazeneca and for novabax but i think that work of finding additional capacity is not done and we need to continue to work on finding it it's not it's not an easy thing you can't just stand up a factory uh overnight but uh we need to be making more investments on expanding manufacturing capacity in india and elsewhere we need dosing studies for those between the ages of 18 and 55 absolutely could save an awful lot of lives they just probably wouldn't be american lives and i yield back thank you uh so much mr chairman mr sherman and thank you for uh pointing out some of those very important facts uh about our capacity to know what's going on um i'll now yield five minutes to representative bar thank you vice chairman uh malinowski and thanks to all of our witnesses i want to especially thank ms nas uh and ups uh not only for your important uh presence in the commonwealth of kentucky but for all the great work that ups has done on vaccine delivery delivering over 93 million doses to more than 46 countries our thanks to you and it's a reminder of the very valuable contributions of the private sector in the fight against cobia 19 not just the pharmaceutical industry but ups as another great example i do want to focus on the world health organization issue for any of our witnesses that the house china task force on which i was proud to serve found that the who was a co-conspirator in covering up the coba 19 outbreak in wuhan parroting the ccp propaganda and disinformation leading to millions of deaths worldwide last year secretary pompeo stated that the leadership of the who was corrupt and that the pandemic was a direct result of the chinese communist party covering up and doing it with a complicit world health organization uh now mr sherman has seemed to um excuse the who from this uh status that's a co-conspirator on the on the grounds that they don't have an intelligence arm i would simply submit that any organization any international body that disregards the untrustworthiness of the ccp and blindly accepts their propaganda is either incompetent or more likely a participant in the malfeasance we have seen the who fold to pressure by the ccp before what if i could just get this question out mr sherman what reforms do do you all think are necessary at the who because i think mr sherman this gets it what we all should be focused on and that is what reforms do you think are necessary at the who to make sure a cover-up like the coronavirus uh never happens again any any of the witnesses i i would look forward thank you for the great question ranking member i would put forward several and i would also commend you uh the council on foreign relations where i work recently convened a task force to look at these very issues uh the thing i would point out with regard to the world health organization in china is uh in terms of the assessment in our report china was clearly uh or the world health organization rather is clearly too crutchless of the claims china was making and they were a week late in declaring a public health emergency of international concerns the world health organization is a member state organization uh its tendency to defer to countries in crisis is not particular to china we saw similar patterns in west africa and the democratic republic of congo what we need is threefold first is a surveillance system hospital-based sentinel surveillance system that is not dependent on the transparency and self-reporting of directly affected uh member states we need a reform to the emergency committee that forms as part of the process of declaring a public health emergency so that is more transparent and rigorous and last we need more clarity as to what the international health regulations require in terms of information sharing because that lack of clarity has led to numerous nations not china just china to turn over uh to be slow to turn over information well well on a related related point um i am worried about china's vaccine diplomacy as many of the witnesses also uh pointed out uh and it's i think part of china's belt and road initiative uh and i think it's um i think their their vaccine distribution uh efforts um with substandard vaccines um when they haven't even addressed their own population um could be a very have a very negative impact my question is what is the effect on the fight against the virus if china engages in vaccine diplomacy with vaccines developed in secret and not accepted by the larger international community and how are we going to make sure that the who doesn't give their stamp of approval on a vaccine we do not know is safe let me let me try uh this congressman a couple of things some first of all i think it's incredibly important that these vaccines go through a regulatory approval kind of the same kind of rigorousness of the european medicine agency the us fda um and and i have encouraged countries around the world to not just take clinical data from us from a study that might have been published in a journal but to make sure that these vaccines are rigorously evaluated who has a list of regulatory agencies that should be doing a careful evaluation of these vaccines i think that's important um i worry a lot about the about the vaccines that we've seen so far from china they're clearly much lower efficacy i don't know how safe they are i suspect they're safe but suspect is not evidence so we need a lot more openness and data and i have encouraged countries to make sure that these things go through a proper regulatory evaluation dean thank you very much for your testimony i yield back uh thank you uh representative barn if i could just allow myself a brief comment if believing chinese spends on covet 19 makes you complicit in their malfeasance i assume that would also go for an american president who throughout february and march uh said that china and president xi were doing a fantastic job despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary i now yield five minutes to representative vera thank you great um thank you vice chair malinowski and you know again want to applaud all the witnesses for the the work that you're doing yes certainly um you know appreciate dr jaw the the the work that you've done over this past year to to educate the the public um and get us through this and and mr boike the early work he did with our committee when we were you know again you know taking steps to address and get ahead of this pandemic and mr sherman rightfully pointed out that in early february we did have the first sharing on the pandemic and you know obviously you hope this is a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic but as we've seen you know with increasing frequency over the past two decades we've had outbreaks of sarge mers you know certainly he's seeking and and other outbreaks and and that is what's going to happen in an interconnected world so i know dr dr you and i spoke a a few weeks ago you know it is going to be important to look backwards and understand the the lessons learned um in how we ended up where where we are to take the politics out of it but also to understand that the politics but at this moment in time as we look to to stop this virus and beat this virus both domestically and abroad we have to be strategic about this as well we're throwing billions of dollars at building a public health system here in the united states that that we deserve but we're also going to um you know we we talked about vaccine diplomacy and other members have and the importance of the united states showing leadership here um both in this great power competition with china but also um part of the global response has been the lack of the united states leading over the past 12 12 years so i applaud the biden administration for for the return now i applaud the announcement that came out of the the quad leaders um conference last week where the united states japan india and australia will you know move to to provide vaccine and manufacture vaccine for the indo-pacific i guess a a few questions um you know as we look forward and better understand um you know the the impact of this vaccine you know um maybe this this is for for you doctor josh you know we are seeing the the emergent of the the variants and you know again thus far we're lucky enough to have three very effective vaccines um here in the united states that work well to prevent serious illness to prevent hospitalization and prevent death but you know can you to to get to our domestic population why is it so important that the united states gets our vaccines out there to the rest of the world in the context of the variants and potentially what could happen if a variant um emerges that you know is is a little bit resistant to some of the vaccines yeah so congressman thank you for that question i think this is possibly the most important question in front of us because right now we are on track to vaccinate all american adults by may to june uh that's fantastic and it leaves us in very good shape uh the problem is that we're not on track to vaccinate the world anytime soon and variants arise i mean they're somewhat idiosyncratic but the more infections there are the more opportunities there are for variants to arise and so if we continue seeing large outbreaks in places like brazil or south africa or increasingly in the last few weeks india but elsewhere what you're gonna see is you're essentially giving more opportunities for variants and therefore in my mind the big the big worry which i think is not a high likelihood event but would be pretty catastrophic is imagine the emergence of a variant uh that essentially renders our vaccines useless now we haven't seen that yet but i don't feel that lucky given where things have been over the last year and so if we really want to protect the american people we want to have a very very very aggressive global vaccination strategy it also turns out to be the right thing to do for the world it shows our moral leadership there are many many very good reasons to do it uh not the least of which is it's good for the american people and maybe the the few moments i have left mr boerke you know we are in a great power competition and great influence competition with china and certainly we're seeing russia there as well um can you perhaps summarize the stakes and why that vaccine diplomacy is so important to our relationship with the rest of the world absolutely so uh ultimately uh nations are at a moment of crisis now they're under tremendous pressure from their population um and public health need to start rolling out vaccines and they have few options uh 88 of high income countries are distributing the pfizer vaccine but uh it the distribution in middle income countries is uh highly uh correlated to the russian vaccine and um to china's vaccine because they're the only ones they can get countries will remember who came to their aid in moments of crisis what we need to do is present a compelling alternative to the token and strategically driven donations we're seeing out of china and russia we need to launch an operation warp speed for global vaccine manufacturing who kovacs cannot do it they're alone scaling up manufacturing quickly uh requires financing and policy support as the us experience has shown we need to see a corresponding effort like that globally that can do the same we should build it in a way that has a vaccine manufacturing network that's flexible and robust and can respond to future pandemic threats as well because as you rightly noted uh we may refer to this a as a once in a hundred year crisis but there's no reason that should be sho so the next virus could be emerging uh at any time and we need to have the tools to respond to it right thank you and mr buy chairman i'll yield back uh-oh did the vice chairman freeze on us sorry it keeps on muting thank you so much for pointing that out uh representative smith is next for five minutes thank you very much uh mr chairman jeremy it's nice to see you let me just ask you a couple of questions uh first of all in 2020 africa had fewer cases of covet 19 about 3.5 according to the african centers for disease control and prevention and fewer deaths in other parts of the world they credit robust containment and a younger population as factors but the emergence of variants that are more transmissible and deadly has now resulted in a fatality rate in 2021 that is above the global average matter of fact as we all know tanzania's president who was a pandemic skeptic has just passed away reportedly from covid19 so we may have a problem with statistics with uh infections going unnoticed and undocumented i i i also and ms mckenna i'm glad you brought up the food insecurity issue which i bring up every chance i get i have a bill pending along with karen bass that would really create a strategy to make sure uh that the locusts which have not been uh silenced and and eradicated where they ought to be uh in part because of covid and they are destroying crops uh at an unprecedented level uh in in many parts of africa and some parts of asia so my my question there is maybe you want to elaborate on the need for doing more to ensure that food insecurity 40 million people or so in east africa are food insecure and finally a question about the efficacy and safety of the chinese vaccine vaccinations sanovac and sino farm and any others you know francis collins obviously director of nih when he was asked by an axios reporter what the trump administration got right in the effort to fight coveted 19. he gushed and i watched it about the safety efficacy and unprecedented speed in approving and disseminating life-saving vaccinations he praised trump's operation warp speed and said that they brought all the parts of government together in a this is his words an unprecedented way to test up to six vaccines in rigorous trials close quote he pointed out that nobody really thought it could happen other than the president and some of his top people but in december there are two vaccines that had gone through trials of at least 30 000 people and had been judged to be safe and effective through the process he called it just breathtaking now my concern and some of my colleagues have also related this as well are the vaccinations the vaccines i should say coming out of china or anywhere else are they passing such vigorous protocols to ensure safety and efficacy uh and again uh with it look looking like africa may seem a prevalent spike visually the rest of the world um how can we best help them uh with these vaccines that have been proven to be so safe and effective here in the united states i would yield to my uh to the distinguished pata congressman smith i'd love to take up your question of food security thank you for asking sorry excuse me yes please do thank you thank you for asking i actually had the pleasure of leading the us government's food security program for for many years um as i mentioned earlier we we now have 271 million people acutely food insecure um and and several factors are explaining this one the pandemic has decimated wage and remittance incomes um two it's disrupted food supply chain so inputs aren't reaching farmers pastoralists can't reach their pastors um people aren't being able to go into the markets to sell their foods and third in some places the pandemic has disrupted the systems that help combat the effects of food insecurity so as health systems focused on containing and as schools close you know many children in africa especially rely on school feeding programs many families rely on programs like food for school that send food home for families who are in acute food need um we there are several things tools that are our disposal that we have been using to fight this and to really push for greater food and nutrition security we're delivering cash and voucher assistance to promote economic well-being and to allow to promote local markets um we also are able to do that with a greater distribution of funds using electronically and contactless but we think the government we think we can do more here and encourage the u.s government to increase the use of multi-year emergency programming to allow us to help households recover and what could be a prolonged crisis as some estimates are that the vaccine won't roll out until 2023 in some places we need to increase cash-based assistance that allows households to to meet their needs we have to support local markets our extensive research has shown that in times of crisis people rely on local economies and markets for their food and finally we have to continue to encourage usaid to break down the internal silos between its bureaus to ensure that development peace building and humanitarian programs coordinate and build on one another this has to be a comprehensive response thank you so much for that excellent answer and guidance if i have time anybody want to tackle the the safety and efficacy of the chinese vaccines and and is it time that our vaccines are shared you know i remember at uh in the 1990s when one of the big pharmaceutical companies suggested to combat the hiv aids pandemic uh global crisis uh they were willing to give away the drug um at cost in order to ensure that people were saved i'm wondering if you know that information needs to be shared in people's lives mr smith your your time has expired but i that i i do think we want to hear uh the an answer on the efficacy of the chinese russian vaccine so thank you thank you if anybody has a quick answer to that i i could just one second look there's a lot of information out there about the chinese vaccines um the russian vaccine they're often come out through press releases they come out in medical journals what we need the reason i have so much confidence in j j moderna and pfizer is because not just because they went through the fda regulatory approval but through that approval process hundreds and hundreds of pages of data were released about adverse events about efficacy different time periods different doses that information is what is needed about all the vaccines before you're going to really build confidence i have not seen that in that level of detail about any of the chinese vaccines i've not seen that level of data on the russian vaccine and until that information is available it is hard to say with any certainty how safe and effective these vaccines are i suspect they are but suspect is not confidence it's my best guess and we'd love to see davis thank you so much thank you so much mr chairman now yield five minutes to representative luke thank you mr chairman i want to commend all the witnesses uh for coming today and offering your expertise i want to note that a little over a year ago secretary of state mike pompeo sat before the foreign affairs committee and responsible questions six times he refused to say the coronavirus was not a hoax and now i'm hearing from the republican ranking member that somehow the world health organization is complicit in some sort of fraud well let's look at the facts in april politico published an article talking about our former president the title of this article was 15 times trump praised china as coronavirus was spreading across the globe so if you're going to criticize world health organization you've got to criticize donald trump who went even further than the world health organization and simply parodying what china said at the beginning of this pandemic so instead of rewriting history we should look at what would help u.s national security and my view is being a part of the world health organization helps us national security so i'd like to ask dr job is it your view that the united states being a part of world health organization is good for america representative uh to me it's a no-brainer the answer is absolutely it is good for america for several reasons um first of all as we've discussed it's really important uh that this pandemic be brought to an end and many many countries around the world depend on who's expertise and guidance uh on all sorts of issues second there are a set of essential services only who can do the way that they can bring people together uh set rules about clinical trials uh et cetera and the question that has been in front of us is do we want to be part of the global effort to solve this pandemic or do we want to try to go it alone and this is not a question in theory because when we step away we see others step into that void uh and take on a role so i think uh it's very very clear to me that who uh needs reform it needs changes uh we are far more likely to influence evolution in a constructive way if we're part if we walk away we will have no voice in that reform and while who uh is only one part of a global health architecture it is essential it's the one place where every country comes together and therefore us not being part of it really leaves america much worse off great thank you i want to commend ups for what you've done in distributing vaccines across america as well as around the world really appreciate your efforts and i i had a question for you um miss napley nas which is uh what is your mask policy at ups sorry sir uh our mask policy so are you asking about specifically in our facilities in the united states as well as for our drivers or global yes for your facilities and for your drivers yeah so our mass policy is is that like with many employers we encourage mass use and i i believe that uh i i don't have responsibility for the united states so i need to come back to you specifically on it but i know in my own office it's a requirement that you wear a mask so great thank you i appreciate that now dr john i'm going to ask you a series of questions that may seem basic but they just need to be asked um the three vaccines in the united states pfizer modern and johnson johnson they work right they do sir and everyone should get these vaccines uh when they're allowed to do so correct absolutely yeah i note that the former president united states hid the fact that he got the vaccine but he still got it because he clearly believed it worked now when someone is coming in the united states from let's say south africa brazil or the united kingdom we don't actually know of the curing a virus right not unless we have tested them thoroughly congressman we would not know and that's why we want everyone around the world to be vaccinated not just those in america correct yes one of the many reasons we want everybody in the world vaccinated absolutely okay also masks work don't they mass are very effective at preventing transmission and good quality mass prevent you from also getting infected and that's because this virus is spread through respiratory droplets and when you talk or cough or sneeze you can spread it on doorknobs at businesses anywhere you go correct that's correct and through aerosols which also people can breathe in so mass are also helpful thank you i'm sorry i had to ask all these basic questions because they're just some of my colleagues across the aisle who continue to reject science i yield back thank you uh uh our next um questioner will be representative chapman representative chabot i yield five minutes to you uh thank you very much before i get to my question just a couple of quick points in response to the previous questioner um i i would just note that uh dr tedros world health argument organization was a shill for the prc for china defending china's abhorrent behavior china covering up uh what was going on there putting the world weeks a month behind uh on what the breakout was happening and allowing their citizens to travel across the globe and spread the disease um you know cornering the market on ppe putting the world at risk uh and and dr tedros essentially was the spokesman defending uh china in the early stages of this and that was one of the principal reasons i think the previous administration uh took the uh the somewhat unprecedented step of pulling this out of the uh who um an organization that is critical we need it um but when you have somebody like that at the top who is china's person um it's just uh he did they did considerable damage uh incalculable damage to the rest of the world to the united states since we've lost over a half million of our fellow citizens but let me get to my questions ms mckenna let me go with you first as you may know a couple of years ago i introduced the girls access to education act along with my democratic colleague robin kelly the legislation which did ultimately become law it is now the law prioritized education in our humanitarian assistance to girls who were in conflict areas who'd been displaced and there was no education for him um so that it it said that should be a priority uh so i'm concerned about the impact that the coven 19 pandemic is having on access to education specifically to those girls abroad who are already not getting the education that they needed that they deserve because their country happened to be either in a civil war or having you know all kinds of things that occur across the globe it's my understanding that millions of girls dropped out of school as a result of the pandemic as boys did as well but this legislation was specifically aimed to help girls um and uh that they might never return or have the opportunity to return to a classroom due to child marriage or scarce family resources or other things now i know we could always uh use more funding but putting that aside you know just more resources are there any other things that we could do to help those girls to get back into school thank you very much for the question and for your long-standing support for the education of girls it's critically important um as you mentioned moving 19 does pose an even higher risk to girls education and well-being um girls are more one schools are closed a lot of girls depend on that for safe spaces they depend on that for food they depend on doing that to help prevent marriage and so we are seeing an increase in girls out of school and and being very vulnerable um we also worry about what is happening to these girls when they're out of school we are working you know we're working really hard to do things to help those girls in school so that they don't lose a lot of their gains so that they can go back um our nigeria team identified a way to work with radio in coordination with local governments to deliver lessons in english and mathematics over the radio we also were able to provide students with workbooks we in kyrgyzstan we've supported 224 schools to hold remote reading camps but i think your question on this also points to the importance of really doing comprehensive programming you know helping programming against covet is not just vaccine in arms it is doubling down on programming to help mother-in-laws and communities understand why child marriage is a bad idea it's doubling down anti-violence programs for girls who are now maybe stuck in in households where there is violence or other trauma we really have to be addressing all of all of these things and not just um vaccines and arms or the medical response when we look at this cases thank you very much i had some more questions but i see i've got eight seconds left so at this point i'll yield back thank you mr chairman thank you so much uh we'll now go to representative wild for five minutes thank you mr chairman um i'd like to direct this question to dr jah dr shah the district that i represent which is the greater lehigh valley of pennsylvania includes several of the country's most innovative medical manufacturing companies one of these companies in my district is orashure they have developed a rapid home test for covid a highly accurate test that an individual can take and quickly get a result much like an at-home pregnancy test rather than having to book an appointment go to a public place and wait for the result to come back from a lab or mail a test to a lab and wait for a result they've completed clinical trials and they are preparing fda submission imminently another company in my district u.s specialty formulations is developing a co-founded vaccine that would be given in a single oral dose no needles or medically trained vaccinators needed and their vaccine would not require refrigeration if these products are approved and brought to market or from or ashore or us specialty or other companies could you discuss the impact they could make in defeating the pandemic particularly with regard to developing countries yeah so uh congresswoman thank you for that terrific question and let me take both of those things on um we still very much need rapid own tests rapid home tests antigen tests but there are other technologies as well uh will be incredibly important because of several reasons one is even when we have a large majority of our population vaccinated the fact the virus will not be gone it will not magically disappear we're gonna have to deal with it having home tests will be a very important part of that uh especially if we're not able to get to 90 or 95 vaccination so it'll be critically important for us to open up our economy to make certain high-risk activities safer it'll also be important for much of the world many places may not be getting these vaccines for a long time you know on the oral vaccine uh it certainly would be a potentially quite a remarkable advancement many many advantages of having an oral vaccine you don't need syringes you don't have to worry about sanitation issues of the same kind meaning reuse of needles and other things that can get people into trouble in in other countries uh you know i have i have children who would be delighted to take oral vaccines over shots so they're probably plenty of americans who would find that innovation to be quite remarkable as well but to be serious if both of those things if they were to come to fruition and be effective and uh authorized by the fda i would see them as as really important advancements in the global fight against this pandemic and you you particularly piqued my interest in talking about the need for at-home tests to be available even as vaccines become more and more readily available can you expand on that both in terms of the u.s front and abroad why are these at-home tests still going to be necessary yeah this has been a little bit of a source of frustration for many of us who have been advocating for more testing availability for the american people and and to take away that need to have a prescription i mean look as a physician i understand the value of having prescription-based uh testing but we've i've really believed many of us have that having widespread availability of testing at home makes a very big difference if you can test yourself at home on a day you may not be feeling well and if you're positive you will tend to isolate and not infect others and there's very good modeling data and other types of data that says if these were widely available it would have made an enormous difference in the fall and winter before we had vaccines but even under the best of circumstances we're gonna have outbreaks hopefully small hopefully uh hopefully containable uh in a post-vaccinated world and therefore having home tests are a really good way of catching them early and stopping them before they end up infecting a lot of people and could you just comment generally on the on the um importance of having at-home tests or rapid tests in underdeveloped areas uh that are less likely to have up-to-date um or nearby medical facilities yeah absolutely so this is another really important issue in many many places around the world uh access to physicians nurses other types of healthcare providers is limited they're expensive people have to pay out of pocket and so for especially for the world's poor the ability to do rapid testing have access to it can make an enormous difference in helping people get diagnosed early in the disease course isolate before they they infect other people in their community or in their family so again the rapid the availability of rapid tests uh can be a very powerful tool in fighting this pandemic everywhere but particularly i think in low resource settings and i assume that would include rural areas or in the u.s and elsewhere absolutely thank you so much i yield back mr chairman representative wilde thank you representative wilde we will now go to representative wilson for five minutes thank you very much chairman malinowski and it sounds good chairman malinowski uh as we begin today i want to thank ms nas uh we're very fortunate here uh in the midlands of south carolina we have a ups hub right next to my house and so i certainly appreciate the thousands of jobs that you've helped initiate and i know what a important corporate citizen you are and so thank you for your participation today and the us private sector is leading the way on ingenuity and innovation and responding to the pandemic in a classic case of course is the example of mark johnson uh their cooperation which clearly was initiated and begun under the trump administration this should not be a partisan issue because it's clear that it was initiated uh prior to january the 20th at at this time how can congress and the united states government offer and better support u.s private investments to combat the pandemic particularly in developing countries well i can i can start and say um as i said in my opening remarks congressman the the most important is the most important but certainly a central part of getting the pandemic under control globally is uh vaccinating the world and right now the problem is vaccine production it's not dollars per say the money is always an important part of this and vaccine production doesn't happen magically it does require uh innovative approaches from the private sector so i think if we think about the manufacturers right now who have uh who are vaccine who are producing these vaccines if i were advising congress or advising the president i would say got to get these manufacturers together we really have to look at what unused manufacturing capacity is there in the world right now there's probably not a lot how do we do more at risk purchases so that companies if they make investments they know that there's going to be a market afterwards for them to sell into there's a series of steps that i think are absolutely critical uh that the government the us government can play in helping expand the vaccine supplies for for the world and hey i'm glad to see that indeed as the former co-chairman of the india caucus i know how uh the pharmaceutical industry of um of india is extraordinary and what a great alternative to another country located in asia but the bottom line is working together we can make a difference and miss mckenna uh how effective has usaid been in its programs to address challenges around the world and what can we do to assist the usaid in their efforts thank you very much for that question representative wilson um the us the usaid and the us government at the beginning of the pandemic was was very very effective at um allowing us greater flexibility within the envelope of money that we had um to to redirect things towards that that helped include like water sanitation hygiene um and and other matters that we're helping and prevention and information so we thank them for that um the amounts of new money that were available were limited but but the american rescue plan also helps that so several things that that the u.s usaid can do is to continue focusing on comprehensive reform comprehensive programming and not just the health programming as we've said the economic impacts of this have been devastating we have lost decades of gains in eradicating global poverty and that just creates a host of other problems we'd also encourage the usa to start looking at the global fragility act and to prevent looking at ways to prevent conflict and we also need to think about multi-year response to this unfortunately in many areas we serve it will be a long time before the vaccines are distributed and taken widely and so we're going to have multiple year potentially even into 2022 2023 so we're going to have multiple years of this and multiple years of those long term secondary effects so we really do need to think of this as a longer term comprehensive problem and it needs to have those similar solutions and thank you thank you for your thoughtfulness and mr balochi the united states is uh now in a downward trend on the pandemic and we understand of course that it began in wuhan china and despite the world health organization i think as my colleagues uh have stated it has been subverted by the chinese communist party uh but with that should we be uh optimistic uh about the rest of the world in terms of a downward trend i think it's going to largely depend on how quickly i think we're not hearing you very well yeah i think we're uh we're having some technical difficulties with your future uh for the rest of the world for countries that give you the kind of thing have you done greases that i'm trapped i think um while we work on that uh and i'm sorry sorry to catch you up i'm sorry that hey but thank all thank you very much mr chairman for for your good work thank you sir uh i will now yield five minutes uh to my good friend congressman phillips to ask an incisive question thank you mr chairman uh i was going to direct my first question to mr boyki but i will afford him some time to uh get back online and thank you so much for to our witnesses uh for being with with us uh mrs mckenna i'll direct my first question to you and it's relative to disinformation you mentioned a rumor tracker in your remarks and i'd love it if you might speak for a moment about its efficacy relative to countering disinformation and misinformation as it relates to vaccinations and the pandemic yeah um so so we know we've learned from our covid work that building community engagement and trust is essential um and and a public health crisis like this is only exacerbated by places with weak governments with that mistrust in government um and miss justin public health officials so with the rumor tracker we've been piloting the rumor tracker um and we've also done um kind of several other things like that using digital data to to to push out other messages what it does is it kind of picks up what people are hearing and it allows us to just address it directly um and to address that source of misinformation right we're not hinting around it we're not saying um you know we're not talking in generalities um because it's it's just very important for us to combat rumors um and and promote safe hygiene practices um but also you know a lot of this is is used and taken advantage of uh to create scapegoats to marginalize certain populations further um to exacerbate mistrust or and to come up with uh people have all kinds of things they think this is meant to do when you let that flourish so really getting to the root of that and really working with actors like us and my colleagues um my other peer organizations who have good relationships with these local communities is quite important so is it fair to say that ngos uh canon should be playing a significant role in combating this information we have to we are the we are the organizations working in the areas with people that are hardest to reach and with people that are the most vulnerable and and we will not solve this without uh working with people that already know these communities well thank you and we're grateful to you for that it looks like uh mr boyce you're back online welcome back at least you didn't become a cat no no no uh i i want to speak about corruption as uh we're all aware uh u.s customs recently seized more than a hundred thousand counterfeit counterfeit masks uh bearing 3m label that were shipped from hong kong likely just to drop in the river of counterfeit goods that flow from china and other countries to the united states uh you know mr bucky you you address the importance of supply chain transparency your testimony a bit but i'd like you to speak to how is corruption and counterfeiting affecting global supply chains especially for critical goods and what should we be doing about it right great question uh so for it's one of it's an important reason but one of several why we need greater supply chain transparency in this crisis uh we need it because what we have seen uh around export restrictions is disrupting supply chains that we need ultimately to uh build out new manufacturing sites when you build a new manufacturing site it needs a supply chain around it so the only way we can do that is by having greater transparency where supplies exist and allowing those flows to occur it's also valuable for this track and trace function that feeds into our owner anti-counterfeiting effort and we have seen episodes not just around mass which you've correctly identified has been one but around faulty uh diagnostic tests that have also uh played a role in substandard reagents that have gone in a lot of therapeutics in this crisis so the lack of transparency we have in manufacturing and input supplies uh is something we have to address standing up a uh surveillance system is one way that we can attack all those problems at the same time so it's a critical piece and we still don't have that with a lot of active pharmaceutical ingredient or many of the other compart uh components of what is that issue in this crisis and and doctor i see you shaking your head yes as well if you might speak to the same relative especially to uh some of those reactive agents and the like are you concur i do and i have to say congressman i've been worried about this because the history of substandard and falsified medicines as well as falsified vaccines is something that has not gotten much attention i mean my gosh we're in a tough enough situation if falsified fake vaccines basically start showing up in the market yeah i mean we can all imagine the complexity and the problems that that causes so what mr boike is saying is incredibly important yeah and if i just might ask both of you too you know from what countries or which country should we be most concerned about i think i know the answer but i'd like to hear from you too uh relative to where we should direct our attention historically particularly on the reagent concerns there have been um and in the active pharmaceutical ingredients where we've seen adulterated or substandard components uh the source has often been china again this is the reason to engage in global manufacturing as dr john and i have been and others have been asking for in this in this hearing because ultimately until we provide a compelling alternative desperate countries will resort to desperate measures in terms of where they get their supplies and medical interventions and unfortunately they don't always come with the regulatory oversight we need thank you thank you all to our witnesses uh grateful i yield back thank you representative phillips will now go to representative perry for five minutes well thank you uh mr chairman new poll i was looking at said about half of americans now view china as america's greatest threat that's more than double since this time last year you know i don't think we need to dig very far uh to figure out why people think that uh international institutions have been marginalized by china you've got espionage occurring in universities and and uh our businesses uh around the united states uh and quite honestly the lies regarding you know we call this a coronavirus but you know there's a reason we call other diseases or maladies they're they're characterized by where they came from but evan forbid you say china uh regarding this one and of course the ongoing efforts regarding genocide or against their own people and the bellicose activities towards their their neighbors you know i think that washington we could keep up with the wisdom of a lot of the american people now just as an aside here or related just yesterday the director of the africa cdc was invited as a witness to the african global health subcommittee hearing just last year the doctor was quoted saying that the chinese government's response this new outbreak has been swift and decisive and also that china has made remarkable progress in responding effectively to disease outbreaks now these comments were made with with zero corroboration by key international stakeholders including the world health organization china's presently peddling its cheap vaccines you just talked about it to nearly 40 countries with dozens more countries pending um you know we don't need to invite people into congress congress's committee rooms who who are uh who are furthering this it's propaganda in my opinion and uh you know especially from a country that's plagued the world with this this scourge um you know i wonder what happened to the demands that dr tedros of the world health organization resigned from his post i mean a year ago uh i think a lot of people were talking about that and uh and now it hasn't been raised at all in several months as a matter of fact he seems more involved than than ever and i don't know how this individual has any credibility i mean he's the leader of the world health organization and and and we're using american tax dollars to pay this organization this individual praised china for its extraordinary measures to contain the outbreak when when it had nothing to do with containing the outbreak as a matter of fact that it sent millions of people that were potentially infected around the globe i mean it essentially spread the outbreak um and now he's leading this kovacs the main global effort to vaccinate as many as people possible and we're here in this panel today talking about potential counterfeit or ineffective vaccines which will undermine the the credibility and the faith that that people in the world have about our ability to to create effective vaccines um i think we need to use the considerable leverage that we have uh if we're going to certainly if we're going to fund the who to have dr tedros removed from his his post i just think that uh many foreign leaders are under considerable domestic pressure to produce a product and a vaccine with a reported 50 percent efficiency rate is still better than nothing however you know china has been masquerading its ineffective vaccine as global health assistance uh while at the same time providing disinformation about pfizer and moderna uh which we have paid dearly for in the united states maybe this question goes bester mr baliki um how do you think we can most effectively counter the disinformation campaign being conducted by the chinese communist party and quite honestly the russians as well in this in this vein great thank you congressman um there there's much in your statement um to to agree with uh there's it's there's no question trying to notify the world late of the emergence of the virus uh there's also it's also incontrovertible for a critical period of weeks in january that china did not share material information about how this virus spreads at a time when doing so may have helped domestic infection control but also uh to reduce the spread of the virus internationally um i think on the who side i do want to state for the record that i think the uh case for their performance endemic is a bit more joe prompted a notification of this virus china didn't if i notice report and ask them to uh who has coordinated the low and middle income country response to this uh pandemic uh on the budget of a mid-sized hospital so while there's much they have not done right in this crisis there are some things that have done that they uh have done well and we should take the good with the bad and thinking about how to address that institution moving forward the best thing we can do to capture diplomacy coming out of this pandemic is presenting compelling alternative uh vaccines it really is a critical issue for how uh nations will be able to respond moving forward to this pandemic thank you mr chairman uh thank you sir and uh i just think there ought to be some accountability for horrific failures especially when we're paying for them with that i yield back thank you mr chairman thank you uh we will now turn to representative titus for five minutes thank you mr chairman uh i'd like to address this to ms mckenna if i could please and your written testimony you mentioned how the pandemic has erased a lot of the positive gains that have been accomplished over the past few years in achieving better gender equity you know around the world we have seen that many uh women were on the front line jobs they either couldn't give up their jobs or they gave up everything to stay at home with their families uh and yet at the same time they're the ones who've been spearheading economic development more women are in political office they're changing policies like violence towards women we say when uh women make progress the world makes progress their change changes agent changes uh i i just want change agents rather i just wonder if you can talk about what you and other ngos are doing to try to bring back some of that loss of gender equity and what we might be doing to help shore you up and promote that cause is she gone apologize i apologize i was muted i'm sorry um thank you very much congresswoman titus and for allowing me the opportunity to talk about this it is one of the more devastating um effects of impacts of this uh of this coronavirus um like i said we've seen um we've seen erosions in development gains we've seen increases in food security increases in violence and and we think they're increases in conflict that are coming and women and girls are bearing the brunt of this between poor health outcomes the earnings losses that you mentioned greater violence towards them and also the burden of being caregivers often in multi-generational households with more vulnerable members in those households um it's really important that that that we the development community that me and my colleagues out there we are really redoubling our efforts towards women and our programming towards them um that that includes working with violence preventions with both men and women in their communities um partnering with um we have a partnership with for example with the women's refugee commission to violate to pilot this innovative older male sibling and caregiver intervention to change family norms around violence towards girls we've tried to move quickly to online teaching and providing spaces for digital learning online or through radio or other places training community givers providing access for work one of the things that we've been doing in ethiopia is domestic workers especially we're not able to work we've created an app and a matching system to find new jobs for domestic workers we also in our cash and voucher assistance prioritized domestic workers who had been laid off who were particularly vulnerable um so making sure that we look particularly at the ways that this is affecting girls that the different places where they go the jobs that they have and working to support those industries first and foremost with our economic activity as well as with the social um needs that these women and girls have now with this virus well thank you very much i think this gives us something that we need to work on and support through maybe ndiri all of your kind of development agencies uh to promote both economic and political uh equity to move these policies forward for sure we know when women are at the table and developing the response they tend to be better responses absolutely well thank you mr chairman i yield back you we will next go to representative issa please well thank you if everyone can hear me um this quick thank you uh you know dealing with uh sub-saharan africa and other developing nations and areas is always a little frustrating but i think the pandemic is has exacerbated it the need is greater but it appears as though there are some unanswered questions and i'd like the panel to answer one of them uh from what we can see the african union made a decision to buy uh hundreds of millions of doses at a cost about three times higher from the russians with a non-generally approved or believed in a vaccine versus buying uh one of the four three to five different ones that would be available in about the three dollar range so my question for the panel is uh if the most important thing is to get vaccine to people why are why how can we justify funding the african union or helping fund them pay uh what can only be seen as dubious amounts for a less proven vaccine looking to see if any of my colleagues are going to jump in let me start it uh congressman um i my sense is i i is that the bigger issue here is vaccine availability and what is actually available to people the russian vaccines are available uh my personal take is i don't know enough about the russian vaccine sputnik v spitnik5 to know whether i would be comfortable taking it or not the data is just not there and whereas i would much prefer that the world get vaccinated with the vaccines that have gone through regulatory approval you know the list but those vaccines are not generally available right now because uh we have bought up a lot the western europeans have bought up a lot and so countries are faced with a tough choice which is get the johnson and johnson and moderna but you may not get any supplies for six months or a year or buy what's available today at the price that is available today you can understand why people make the decisions they do i think part of our job in showing our global leadership is to give people alternatives uh so they're not choosing between getting a vaccine that has not gone through the full approval versus nothing at all but instead have the option and the opportunity to purchase and get vaccines that we think have gone through the rigorous trials that are necessary and would you like i mean you commented on sputnik it you know it's three times the cost uh is there any justification other than greed by the russians that would justify the ten dollar a dose cost yeah you know i i want to say vaccine pricing in this pandemic is really strange i mean it's a it's not obviously a normal market right and people are charging what they can or what they want to and um you know and for a really highly highly effective vaccine you'd say ten dollars a dose is a bargain if you think about you know the value that they generate for people so um i i i there may be others on the panel who are smarter and more knowledgeable about the pricing of the russian vaccine but i would say my sense is it's much more about availability and if it's if it's the one available people are gonna be willing to pay whatever the price is well in a quick follow-up obviously uh we're dealing with a population of over a billion uh the purchase is only for a fraction of that uh the the same question again why is it the african union doesn't seem to be at least uh buying what could be made available as part of their process at uh substantially less so i i if you don't mind uh i'll i'll weigh in a little a little bit i'm sorry you broke up you wave a little white around these this is shoes are you able to hear me now sir yes okay terrific it was say with uh most of the capacity was locked up by the united states we're still having difficulties hearing you mr boyce yeah i'm afraid resources slow to get to kovacs so they is any better than okay mr chairman i appreciate i i think is there actually donating i'm sorry it's coming in delayed all righty uh again i'm sorry about the the technical difficulties that was an important question and answer um uh now shall i try again yeah we we're gonna we're gonna move on to uh congresswoman mr chairman i would just ask that the uh anyone that wants to respond for the record and we'll look at it in writing thank you of course yeah we'll all have the opportunity to follow up in writing um so i will uh now go for five minutes to representative spanberg thank you very much to our witnesses and thank you mr chair i appreciate you recognizing me so i have a background intelligence and i'm aware of the importance of detecting threats early on so along these lines i recognize the importance of global health surveillance programs and ensuring that the information gathered through these programs to inform u.s and global public health approaches dr zha in your view what what went wrong in terms of some of our early detection of kovid and how can we remedy and rectify this going forward well it's going to say it's the million-dollar question but it's probably the multi-trillion dollar um question of what went wrong a lot of things um so certainly uh we did not have the kind of global surveillance that allowed us to pick up this disease before china first made the who aware my my sense is uh that this disease by the time end of december early january came around 2019 to 2020 the disease was out it was out in in many countries we probably had cases here in the united states um but we did not have the kind of surveillance system that would have allowed us to uh to identify this we have largely in the past and and i think we need to really rethink this relied on countries reporting their own outbreaks and every country and every outbreak has an incentive initially to downplay it uh for the obvious reason that they always hope that it'll just go away and then they don't have to make the world aware i think that is a second vulnerability uh and i think the other part is that we we really need in independent assessment of these data uh that are independent of who and again i i i'm not somebody who blames uh who for all of this because they are they are really confined and and constricted by the fact that they are a membership organization and therefore they can do what their members allow them to do but you need an independent body to assess it so we need far better surveillance capability uh we need a different way to sift through the data and then we need an independent assessment of that data we didn't have really any of those things uh so in some ways it is not totally surprising that we found ourselves what we did could you speak just a little bit more to why countries and and presumably just uh an issue of kind of reputation but are there are there any other reasons from a scientific perspective from a public health standpoint why countries would be slow to uh report uh a situation like uh copen19 as an example it's largely economic congresswoman i mean basically what happens is when i think about like what happened in west africa with the ebola outbreak and their who's failures were far more catastrophic uh i mean obviously didn't have the same global impact but for months wh down play what was happening in west africa and in the ebola outbreak and really because the countries were asking who in some ways to downplay it and the reason is if there's an ebola outbreak you certainly don't get much tourism trade and travel stop you know slow way down and there's a reputational impact and all of those things countries are very afraid to uh to admit those things early on it's only when it becomes no longer deniable uh that countries tend to fess up but often uh things are the cat is way out of the bag by that with the american rescue plan we included significant resources for kova testing and tracking including the detection of new variants as well as resources to bolster u.s disease detection and warning systems uh just a continuation on the discussion of what happened at the beginning of the pandemic um could could you just speak a little bit to why disease surveillance even at later stages in a pandemic like where we find ourselves are critical and and what public health officials seek to do with that information absolutely so if you think about the variants that are circulating b117 the one from the uk um why did it why was it found in the uk because uk does really good genomic surveillance so they identified the case early south africa actually does very good genomic surveillance and they were pretty early to find the b1351 the point is you can't find these things unless you're looking for them and this pandemic isn't over and this virus isn't done evolving and so if we are not tracking these things if we're not seeing the emergence of of variants from around the globe if we are not able to understand what properties variants have we're going to essentially be sitting ducts to new variants that are going to get us into a lot of trouble so surveillance is not the end-all but it is absolutely the first step you can't really do much in a disease outbreak if you can't track what's happening and in terms of just what you can do with that surveillance information that's what's allowing we hear about the research of boosters the different pharmaceutical companies and that's all a result uh not to put words in your mouth but that's the result of the surveillance is that right absolutely absolutely no that's exactly right and so if we think about these boosters and when will we need them and which who will need them this will all depend on what happens with these variants our ability to identify it early and see its impact on the population make clinical decisions about whether we need a booster or not who needs the booster build it test it deploy it there's a lot of steps here but it begins with surveillance thank you very much dr john mr chairman i yield back thank you so much representative spanberger uh we will now go to representative mask for five minutes chairman i appreciate it uh dr john just want to make sure you're paying attention because i'm ultimately going to be asking you a couple questions um you did state a number of things in your uh written testimony and i love that you didn't have the exact same testimony when you spoke about it it's always a frustration to hear the same thing that i read exactly but so i appreciate that um but you did talk about we live in a deeply interconnected into interdependent world um and uh you also stated that it's essential that we maintain basic health measures until every high-risk person is vaccinated and i want to talk a little bit about travel cdc uh issued an order in january requiring negative pre-departure covet 19 test results or documentation of recovery from coven 19 for all airline passengers arriving into the united states from any foreign country is that good policy uh i i believe it is uh congressman i think right now uh the thing i would add to it is vaccination with a high quality vaccine would be a reasonable addition to that list as well but i do believe that it is important that we know when people are coming in that they're not coming in actively infected are you aware that somebody right now would have to go through those requirements to fly from mexico city into houston or dallas or miami or anywhere in the country but somebody could essentially walk across our border uh without being tested several days prior or showing that they've recovered by pretty much any name that they decided to use needing no identification do you see that as a risk if you see it as good policy that we have that for people that we know that are traveling in is that a pretty big risk um so congressman i do believe that people who come into the united states irrespective of how they come into the united states uh it is good policy to test people uh before they enter the united states or obviously have uh documentation that they've been previously infected or vaccinated by fiat it's bad policy to not do that well i mean i just said i think it's good policy i think it's a good way to protect the american people all right don't be scared about saying it's nothing i'm pretty comfortable saying what i think sorry um i see that as a pretty big issue uh i think a lot of people see that as a big issue as well i find it funny when i think about some of the comments that was made by our colleague mr liu and and i went back and looked at his twitter and he said you know when merriam-webster dictionary defines super spreader event in the future uh they're going to show a picture of uh of a donald trump rally and uh i would wonder would you classify what's going on at the border as a super spreader event well sir i have to say i have not been i don't know what's happening in terms of testing and and isolation at the border so i can i just it's not something i've looked into closely uh as of the last few hours they're working to do more testing there hasn't been a great deal of it but some cities along the texas border have taken it along themselves to do some of this because of the risk to their populations brownsville texas tested about uh 17 to 1800 individuals had about a six percent uh return rate of those that tested positive for covid a little slightly over 100 that tested positive for covid and they undertook this because individuals were not being tested they were coming in they were essentially being given taxpayer-funded travel into brownsville and then being released to go off to 7-eleven or to go off to get on another bus sit next to mom or dad on that bus or somebody's kids and travel somewhere across the country i i would say that would be the definition of of of a national super spreader event could you agree with me on that well as i said congressman i i certainly agree that people who come into our country anywhere at the border i'm asking about is that parameter meet the the the terminology of super spreader event people coming in they're not being tested we realize that there's a good percentage of them that have coveted and then are being sent across the country in public travel would that be a super spreader well so the super spreader event has a very specific meaning which is in a ticket yes or no because not because i don't want to hear you but because my time is running low sir it would not as i understand it classifies a super spread event but it wouldn't be a good idea i'm glad you agree it wouldn't be a good idea we can argue about the semantics later let me ask you one more question sir to stop the spread of covid19 into the united states do you feel that we should return to the quote remain in mexico policy in order to protect americans uh should we return to saying that people should remain in mexico uh instead of being allowed into our country as they're coming to approach our borders you know congressman i really i'm i'm not well versed in in immigration policy i have uh i can talk about clovid no no this is covet policy this is covet policy to protect americans from covet should we return to you stay in mexico when you're approaching our border because you haven't been tested this is covent policy i would say people should be tested uh one way or the other and and that's really the key issue thank you for your time i uh will now go for five minutes uh to representative connolly thank you mr chairman can i be heard yes you can great um let me ask uh thank you so much for holding this hearing um i would like to focus a little bit on two two subjects one is what is your assessment of how inequitably vaccine supplies have been made available to lower-income countries and longer term what's the impact of that that in that sort of inequality in distribution and availability and supply and then secondly what impact has the pandemic had in your view on retrogression on democratic norms practices institutions um you know we had a report that 80 countries have actually backslid on democracy to what extent does the pandemic make that easier uh and more problematic for those of us who want to promote democracy as we go forward so the inequality question about vaccine distribution supply and the democratic resilience test or backsliding that we're experiencing because of the pandemic or related to the pandemic well let me maybe i can start on the vaccine part quickly and inequality uh congressman um it's hard to overstate how big a deal this is and let me lay out two parts of it i mean obviously just the sheer direct effect that there are millions of people who are gonna get infected many people are gonna die at a time where we have vaccines widely available uh that in a vast majority of countries united states healthcare workers haven't gotten them elderly haven't gotten them uh and i think that's a huge problem here's one very specific angle that i think i would love for us to consider healthcare workers in many of these countries are few and far between there aren't that many doctors there aren't that many nurses and when this pandemic kills healthcare workers which is tragic tragic under any circumstance it devastates communities and health systems for a generation and we are seeing the death of healthcare workers in places where there are so few healthcare workers and the fact that we have not gotten vaccines to these places means it's going to be a generation before these health systems can build back that will have massive negative effects on health for the next 20 years so it is in my mind hard to overstate the negative health effects of this inequality this is not just a six month delay oh it's not great it's awful and we're going to be paying the price and the world's going to be paying the price for this for decades if i if i may build on that congressman to your democracy question but i'm actually going to link both of your great questions there on the inequity side uh 400 million vaccine doses have been administered worldwide three out of four doses by just 10 countries now you can justify different amounts or quantities of vaccine going to different countries if they were going to where the crisis is the greatest and where they can do the most good that is not the case the u.s is actually by and large using vaccines at a similar pace or in similar amounts to our case burden particularly since november but when you look at many of the other countries that are consuming large quantities of vaccines that is sadly not the case in the meantime a whole handful of countries again central eastern europe latin america in particular are going under enormous surges of the virus given the fact that they they don't have sufficient vaccine supplies so that is one demonstration of it when you look at who is donating to covax and who is donating to doses it breaks down by political regime type democracies are donating cash autocracies or autocratizing nations or donating doses and that for countries that have a need to respond to their needs of the domestic population unfortunately for some nations will reaffirm a narrative that democracies have not handled this crisis well they have not handled it well at home and now they're not handling it well abroad so it is incumbent on us uh the united states to present a compelling alternative to that narrative i'd like to add a point on the closing of of civil society space and democracy in this it's actually quite circular so not only are governments able to use this pandemic to stifle civil society you also have a situation where citizens are more upset with their governments for feeling like they're not handling the pandemic very well or that the government's using it as an opportunity for corruption you also have situations where um armed and violent extremist organizations are taking advantage of of the covid situation um to gain sympathizers and supporters for example in somalia al-shabab set up a copic 19 treatment center last year to show its commitment to welfare citizens in contrast to the government so all that also creates more um more incentive for governments to crack down democracy and civil society so we're very concerned i'm sure my time is probably coming up but i want to thank all of you very thoughtful answers and really thought-provoking uh points you've made that i think our committee really needs to focus on in terms of once we're out of this pandemic what's been the follow-up in terms of governance in terms of civil society in terms of democratic buy-in um and we're gonna we've got a lot of work to do uh so thank you all for your thoughtful answers and i yield back mr chairman thank you thank you and and i see the chairman meeks has rejoined us uh so i will um gladly pass the gavel back to you mr chairman thank you mr malinowski thank you for standing in uh while we had [Music] bills on the floor uh and i'm told that we've had a very stimulating our hearing going thus far so i want to thank the witnesses uh for for that uh i've been getting a quick uh catch up in that regards and i'm going to go straight to some of my questions real quick uh i'm going to bypass uh and submit for the record my full statement that i would have made but i just want to uh say that uh you know last week we passed the american rescue plan which was a landmark legislation that will provide americans with the support they need to recover from the economic uh health and social and other impacts of this pandemic but what i want to emphasize was that included in this package was 10 billion dollars for international efforts which is desperately needed for global health support on vaccines and humanitarian assistance the combat of its impacts in crisis areas and economic leads to make sure that we don't lose the hard development gains that the united states has helped create over the years in education and that con and economic opportunity and water and sanitation and food security and human rights it's our responsibility as congress to oversee this funding to make sure it's provided quickly and responsibly to maximum effort a fact i should say and i look forward to uh hearing you know uh to hearing and working uh with the witnesses and with that let me just uh ask my uh first uh question that uh uh you know because i've been pleased to see that the us joined with kovacs under the body administration and this is a multilateral effort to develop produce and provide vaccines around the world to stop the spread of covet and plays an important role in helping ensure vaccine equity but this effort is only successful as the sum of its parts and so my question is how can kovacs incentivize in from donor countries and demonstrate the value of kobach's facility in the face of competition so i i i can take a first shot on at that uh chairman and uh thank you again for convening us and your and your leadership um what i would say is kovacs's ability to increase buy-in is going to depend on its ability to deliver and ultimately we are four months into this global vaccine rollout and kovacs has delivered 29 million of the 400 million vaccine doses that have occurred so under those circumstances uh what is important is that we do what is necessary to support kovacs and being able to manufacture and deliver the two billion doses they intend to by the end of the year because again we're four months into that roll out and they they have quite a ways to go one thing i will highlight here is the issue of export restrictions on raw materials are significantly hindering that process kovacs cannot manufacture vaccines if they can't get access to bioreactor bags other single-use components raw materials that they need to make those vaccines and those restrictions are being imposed by several countries but it includes the united states as well ultimately uh it's understandable that the us is uh prioritizing needs to vaccinate our own population we need at the same time to invest in the manufacturing that can rebuild those supplies and provide them to the rest of the world thank you chairman makes for that i'd like to add covax covers the cost of the vaccine but it does not cover um the distribution of that vaccine and so what you're going to have is is in countries with weak governance or weak infrastructure or even places where there aren't governmental actors like northwest syria um and other places in protracted conflict like syria yemen democratic republic of congo and south sudan we're going to have more challenges with the resources to distribute that vaccine and to make sure that we have equitable distribution in those areas great thank you for that now i mentioned uh in my early introduction about the 10 billion dollars that we had put into the rescue plan so what i'd like to ask is what's your view uh as to some of the areas in which the funding will give us the biggest bang of our buck what do you think and where do you see the greatest needs and building back from covet 19 overseas what would get us the best bang for the buck the chairman makes the biggest secondary impacts that we're worried about right now um are are the the the exacerbating food insecurity um the reduction in gains in global poverty the increased gender and inequality and the increase for violence and conflict so there are a couple things that we'd recommend and we also because of the way that the vaccine rollout is in in some certain countries access to it this we may not have vaccinated populations really until 2022 and 2023. um so there are a few things that we recommend making sure that we have a comprehensive approach that includes food security that includes thanks for wondering girls um extreme poverty um implementing the global fragility act which this committee passed which really studies and looks at the root causes of that conflict and prioritize so funding for that act as well as encouraging the state department and usa to act and fund against it to help prevent more conflict from happening and also really looking at this as a multi-year long-term um development issue which is what it is because of the gains that we've lost and so continuing to look at multi-year emergency funding and mechanisms going into the 2022 foreign ops appropriation bills as well thank you my time has expired so now i'm going to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee on western hemisphere civilian security migration and international economic policy representative mark greene of tennessee for five minutes thank you chairman meeks ranking member mccall and uh thank you to our witnesses for testifying before us today these committees can go very long and i deeply appreciate uh you're staying with us uh so thank you over the past year coveted 19 had a drastic effect on our nation and our world schools have closed businesses have shuttered and global stability has been robbed per capita incomes in 2020 fellow fell in over 90 percent of emerging and developed developing economies and the secondary effects of the pandemic such as increases in mental health issues a rise in infectious disease delays in diagnosis of cancer and an erosion of democratic norms continue to take a toll several new covid variants have also arisen posing fresh challenges to the pandemic response wrapping up ramping up vaccine production and distribution is perhaps the most important thing we can do right now clinical data cited in the new england journal of medicine shows that in the short term the first dose of the pfizer vaccine provides 92.6 efficacy that's why i joined congressman foster and congressman bera in a bipartisan letter to the cdc and the fda requesting the agencies monitor data from countries that are delaying a second dose like the uk and israel this is certainly something the world should be seriously considering the faster we roll out vaccines the faster we end this pandemic as ranking member of the western hemisphere subcommittee i'm particularly concerned about the pandemic's impact in latin america and the caribbean health systems have been overwhelmed economies have drastically shrunk and political tensions are significant we've seen widespread protests in many capitals and peru had three presidents in the span of one peak china is seeking to take advantage of this instability gain a foothold in the region when possible the united states must prioritize vaccine distribution to latin america which is clearly falling behind their desperation has turned many to china's vaccine which comes with political pressure from chinese communist party of course the us and its allies must do more to end the pandemic in the region and prevent china from using a public health crisis for its own political advantage my question is really to anyone in the group who who wants to to take it on there are well-documented efforts of disinformation campaigns waged by china russia iran and others both against western vaccine efforts and legitimate questions about the origins of the pandemic how do these dis information campaigns affect public health particularly in the less developed part of our globe well congressman i can get started um i wanted to say very quickly on the one dose delaying the second dose thing i was um one of the early people back at the in the end of december to call for a delay of the second dose and got no shortage of negative reviews from uh many people in the scientific community but i i still stand by that i think that would have been the right policy and i think uh we're seeing some really terrific results coming out of the uk and how they've done but uh nonetheless uh i think that even though that policy may be less important for us now given that we're getting a lot of vaccines in place um it is still an important part of the of vaccinating uh much of the world and i think getting a single dose out to high-risk people is a very very important thing uh you know on the issue of disinformation this has been one of the most difficult challenges of this pandemic is that i used to believe naively so sir um that misinformation was a you know your uncle bob sent you some article that he read you're like oh gosh he's sharing bad information again no no this is very well designed well concerted often foreign created but not always uh programs to sow confusion uh to create a lack of clarity to undermine confidence in public health measures uh we have seen that throughout the pandemic and i think we're certainly seeing that now with the vaccines it's a huge problem and the best ways to counter that is really find trusted voices that people turn to and having those people counter that information so it's it's one of the big challenges of public health and i think it's going to be a challenge for us across the latin america and the world yeah as a physician i you don't know this but i am a physician i did uh vaccine research at usamrid i i think this is one of the safest vaccines we've probably ever filled it and done so in rapid time so thanks for your comments about that that we this is a political national security thing because china and russia are using this information to basically destabilize our relationship with allies so that's that's why i raised the question thank you and um i now recognize the vice chair the subcommittee on asia the pacific central asia and nonproliferation representative andy levin of michigan for five minutes thank you so much mr chairman and thanks for holding this important hearing can you hear me okay okay all right well it's good to see you dr john i want to thank all the other witnesses i want to jump right back into a discussion about the intersection of public health and foreign policy as it relates to this to vaccines um obviously the united states we need to vaccinate our public i'm not going to criticize us let's go let's get everybody vaccinated but i don't need to spend a lot of time on how the vaccine doesn't i mean the the virus doesn't care about borders and if we allow it even in a from a self-interested point of view if we allow it to run rampant some of these variants are going to come up that defeat the vaccines and we just have to get the whole world vaccinated i'm a big supporter of the trips waiver we had a you know an event on that yesterday um i'm obviously uh supportive of us uh giving financial support but uh you know to others and there's the quad effort but i'm i'm curious to hear from maybe dr john and mr bolicky to start with about how the united states should lead in a global effort that's not just yet another crisis this could this is a world historic moment a 100 year public health emergency where it seems to me that for many decades how the us responds will be a huge stamp on our role in the world so dr john why don't you start in dr uh balochi if you can each comment on that briefly yeah well first of all i could not agree with you more congressman i mean look uh the bottom line here is uh that you know the two countries that are really most actively engaged in vaccine diplomacy russia and china are not doing it out of sheer goodness of their hearts uh they're doing it because they think there is an advantage uh this pandemic like many pandemics really um reshuffle global political order and the question is where is america going to come out on this and i think it is really important to show that a democracy a democracy with a set of values that our country has uh can be a a global force for good in the middle of appendix um i i think we now are at a point where we will have more than enough vaccines for every single adult in america sometime in may maybe earlier this is the time for the administrations to start shifting its thinking about when do we start getting vaccines out to the rest of the world that's one part about money or is it about vaccines where the tube has an american flag on it well what what how it practically speaking and i want to give a mr balochi moment too because of this his whole point about the autocracies and democracy no i i would i would love to hear from mr volck let me just say one quick thing i i don't i think the issue is first of all we're going to have a lot of vaccines that we have bought up uh through operation warp speed that we're not going to use so we should get those out to other countries second i don't think this is a money problem i also don't think this is an intellectual property problem i think this is fundamentally a hard problem of manufacturing global supplies we've never tried to make 10 billion doses of a novel vaccine within a year but american leadership can help close that gap in a variety of ways let me turn it over to mr balochi great thank you so much for the terrific question and and like dr shai i really agree with uh its premise so the united states needs to mobilize its partners through the g7 possibly the g20 as we've done in the past like the financial crisis to do three things to ramp up supplies we need an operation warp speed for global vaccine manufacturing uh you know multiple members here said here there are a lot of positive lessons that we can draw from that ultimately we didn't just make advanced purchases we coordinated matched suppliers with vaccine sponsors so that we knew that the inputs would be there to actually make those vaccines we mobilized those raw raw materials and made sure we built out the supply chains we need a global equivalent of that and that's useful not just in this pandemic but in the next one we developed this vaccine in record time just 10 months we still lost last year i mean we've had this year 3 million lives at least globally and 20 trillion dollars in economic losses with that delay we need to move faster in future we need that infrastructure second we need better surveillance that can allow uh the reduction in what we've seen in the hoarding of supplies uh that break up the the supplies you need to make that manufacturing we've done that on food security in the response to the in past concerns we built that transparency we haven't done on medical supplies we need it last thing i'll say i completely agree with dr john donation except the one thing i would add to it is we should announce now what the terms and conditions are going to be that we will ultimately donate doses so people can rely on that promise and we should start building the infrastructure that allows those donations to occur because they need to be appropriately labeled and regulated to get where they need to go thank you for that the gentleman's time has expired i now recognize the vice chair of the subcommittee on international development and international organizations and global corporate social impact representative sarah jacobs from california for five years thank you so much mr chair um my first question is for ms mckenna i know you've uh mentioned that conflict uh is going to be a downstream effect of this um and that we need to to focus on implementing the global fragility act i did also notice that in a recent report by mercy corps in some parts of the world the pandemic has created more opportunities for local communities to become involved in peacemaking processes especially given the restrictions for international personnel and so i was wondering if you can expand more on this research and share some examples um talk about ways that we can help expand these models globally during this pandemic but also if there are some best practices we can take from this increase in local involvement that we can continue post-pandemic thank you so much for the question our representative jacobs and and thank you again to this committee and for your leadership on the global fragility act um indeed i think one of the things that we've learned through the years in development is that local community engagement and really working through local actors and with local actors is a path to sustainability and if anything covet has has accelerated that because people have not been able to go so i think greater usaid greater funding support um to work with local organizations to further train them um to further share skills um with them and and greater overhead i hate to get just money but even greater overhead allowances for organizations like ours to do that we we've invested in lots of things around um community protection and and different compliance things uh that may be some um some more local actors would not feel the benefit of doing and so um really looking at our ability to work with them and to further empower local communities the other piece that we are taking very seriously is a community accountability mechanism and really speaking and spending time with communities to talk to them about what their solutions are what they need um and being accountable to them for that and teaching local actors to do that as well so the more we can do to hear the voice to act with people's needs and with local organizations will make us much stronger thank you i appreciate that and if my colleagues haven't read the report i urge you to because there are some some great examples of local collaboration there um miss mckinnon my next question i know some of our colleagues have asked about the southern border i myself uh represent san diego um but i was wondering in general if you've seen an increase or a decrease in migration around the world as a result of the covet 19 pandemic and do you expect global migration patterns to return to more normal patterns once travel restrictions are lifted or is this a more fundamental alteration in uh migration patterns around the world yeah i actually just this morning spent time with our team in the democratic republic of congo talking about internally displaced populations um yes we have seen increases in migration and movements internally and other places because of the economic stress that's placed on communities um and the populations we serve so so without economic stress you see migration but also with that economic stress um you see more opportunity for for bad actors to move in and to either providing support or or doing other things to to take over territories and so um even in in places where they have high rates of internally displaced populations there is quite an increased risk of that just given the instability uh that that covett is creating largely because of the the economic conditions that it's creating uh thank you and uh with that mr chair i'll yield back the remainder of my time thank you generally yields yields back i now recognize the vice chair of the subcommittee on the middle east north africa and global counterterrorism representative kathy manning from the great state of north carolina thank you mr chairman for holding this hearing i want to thank all their all our witnesses for their thoughts the testimony and also for your stamina in staying on to the end and answering all our questions i'd like to start with dr jah you have stated that we are entering an age of increasing numbers of pandemics for all the reasons that you enumerated and you stated that we need to build an infrastructure to withstand future pandemics not only in the united states but globally in light of how interconnected the world is so i wonder if you could elaborate on the steps we should be taking to build this kind of infrastructure and what would a fully prepared uh environment look like um congressman it's a great question and i will tell you that um we really really need we really need to rethink our whole strategy on pandemic preparedness uh the global pandemic monitoring board uh this was an organization that existed beforehand global health security index many people had looked at which countries are most prepared for a pandemic and most assessments said that the number one was the u.s and number two was the uk tells me that we got something wrong um it suggests that we over relied on structural issues like laboratory capacity doctors hospitals and we under emphasize a whole bunch of other assets public health infrastructure data we did not emphasize in any of these exercises issues of social cohesion political misinformation governance there's a set of things that have not traditionally been thought of as pandemic preparedness that we have come to learn is all about pandemic preparedness and so so there's got to be a rethinking of this and going back to the pandemic preparedness model that the obama administration left behind as good as it was wouldn't it's not good enough for uh for the new uh new set of challenges we do need to come up with new strategies for how to deal with data and collecting more surveillance data and managing it you know what i worry about and i i this is an important issue that we're going to have to sort out countries like china are going to be incredibly well prepared for the next 10 minutes because they don't have compunctions around how to use data for surveillance of their populations how to use a variety of data sources like they do things that we would not feel comfortable in a democracy and we should not feel comfortable but we've got to come up with a strategy for not having to choose between security and our values but we've got to figure out how to use these emerging sources of data so there's a lot of work ahead of us surveillance data infrastructure governance i can't get to it all in five minutes but i want to say it's a fabulous question and obviously we'd love to think more with you and your team about how to do that let me go to something a little bit more simple than what you've just described and that is supplies i come from a district that's manufacturing and i had calls from several of my good manufacturing companies saying that they were told by the prior administration to ramp up and make all those ppes that they've been that they've been making for years but have been cut out for cost reasons because because everybody's turned to china for things like gowns and masks and gloves they ramped up they got them all ready and then they missed out on the actual government contracts because they couldn't provide them at the lowest cost and for a variety of other reasons how important is it for us to maintain a domestic supply chain on things like ppe's and other supplies that that we have run short of as we've been able to well first for for keeping people safe but also as we've been able to ramp up and get those vaccines ready well let me quickly say and others may have more thoughts on this it is absolutely essential that certain things we have the ability to do ppe is definitely one of them the other one is is critical pharmaceuticals the uh the active pharmaceutical ingredient of a vast majority of our pharmaceuticals come from china and many of them are then made in india but that that poses a very substantial risk to us uh as a nation so we really need to rethink our entire manufacturing strategy on anything related to health crises and health security and ask how much of it do we want to offshore with whom what are the and there's a broader strategic rethink that needs to happen but certainly domestic supplies of manufacturing is going to be critical for a lot of these things great thank you i have many more questions to ask but with 36 for 35 seconds left i would get to ask the question and be out of time for the answer so i thank you all and i yield back thank you the gentlelady yields back i now recognize the vice chair of the full committee representative tom malinowski from new jersey for five minutes thank you so much chairman meeks and thanks to all the witnesses it's been a a really great hearing and you know i i was hoping that we could uh get through this without rehashing our debates from early last year and unfortunately that was not to be i i uh share the the uh determination to make our work in this committee as bipartisan as possible and i think there there is a a bipartisan common ground on this that reasonable people ought to agree on and that is that obviously the chinese communist party hid facts about the coronavirus obviously the world health organization um did not work hard enough to push back against china in those early weeks but at the same time the united states government does not rely on either china or the world health organization to know what's going on in the world we knew what was going on in china the former president was warned repeatedly in january and february and yet even after the world health organization declared a global earth health emergency he repeatedly praised the chinese leadership um as late as february 29th saying china seems to be making tremendous progress their numbers are way down we've been working very very closely they're doing great president xi gets it again and again and again so let's agree there needs to be investigation of the origins of the virus chinese government should be held accountable but that in no way absolves us of responsibility for what's happened inside the united states um and as for the who let me let me just ask uh mr uh mr boyki this simple question uh if the united states leaves the who uh does that make it harder or easier for china to exercise malign influence there it clearly makes it easier thank you i think that's pretty pretty plain now let's get back to what we need to be talking about and have covered uh i think quite well um and then i'll stay with you mr mr boike uh the united states we like to do things the right way we like to do things the equitable way and the obvious good government approach to how we help the world deal with this crisis is to work through international organizations to deliver resources and let them do their work but there is and you brought this out the tension between that and the legitimate objectives of vaccine diplomacy uh and i think you said at one point that the the democracies are delivering cash and the dictatorships are delivering doses which i think is uh perhaps the line of the hearing and i wanted you to elaborate a little bit on that and advise us on what is the appropriate balance here between working through those institutions and the united states getting the credit we deserve as a global leader in public health at a time when china and russia are trying to steal that credit in the way that we've described great uh thank you for the question um so it it's understandable that democracies that are answerable to voters are going to be reluctant to share doses at a time where each dose sent abroad is one dose that can't be used at home on a voter or with their loved one uh the issue is that autocracies or autocratizing nations don't have the same restrictions and they are filling that gap the way that we can work both work well with multilateral institutions but also advance a role for democracies in this international crisis that can make us safer and present a compelling alternative for nations is to invest in global vaccine manufacturing because that is not what the who is doing and ultimately it's very little of what kovacs is doing there is a role for us to increase supply if we can't share our early doses because of legitimate concerns about what they might mean to share doses at home we have to increase the pie if we if we can't share it we have to make it larger so that we can address these concerns and that really has to be our focus okay is it your expectation and doctor job chime in if if if you like as well given that the the united states and european union countries have reserved significantly more vaccine potentially than we need i know there are variables there that we can't fully predict is it your expectation that we will actually have a significant number of doses that we can share and if so what is the most uh what is the best wisest most effective way of distributing excess doses that we may have great uh so with regard to doses we will definitely have a surplus um the issue of variance may delay when we declare that we have a surplus uh because if they the virus does uh spread more easily we may need to vaccinate higher populations to hire a shared population to achieve the same public health benefit so that is going to delay matters um what we can do is advance announce in advance that we will be donating and what the terms will be donating and set up that infrastructure the fact that we're not providing any information with regard to that really puts us at a disadvantage to nations that are quite uh willing to fill that gap while we while we wait for more information how we should distribute the doses should ultimately go where they can do the most good um so kovacs does provide a vehicle for doing that but they it is the who mechanism uh it's member state oriented they want to provide doses everywhere in the world it may be that the countries that need are suffering are having the largest crisis or not where kovacs would immediately send it to so it's probably pursuing both channels some to kovacs and some to the nations in greatest need which at least for the time being is latin america which may make some sense from a strategic perspective from the us as well thank you i now recognize uh the vice chair of the subcommittee in the western hemisphere civilian security migration and international economic policy representative juan vargas from california for five minutes thank you very much mr chairman i appreciate it very much and i appreciate you holding this hearing um one of the good things about going last or semi last is you get to listen to everything one of the bad things about going last is all the people that make all these statements and then leave they don't get to hear the report i have to tell you the rewriting of history today was pretty remarkable um i heard one of my colleagues say a doctor who testified in congress said that china was doing a great job this individual praised china to contain the virus that with zero corroboration uh well it wasn't zero of course they were listening to president donald trump if i could just quote it for this january 22nd one of the great things about our just signed giant trade deal with china is it will bring both the usa and china closer together in so many other ways terrific working with president xi a man who truly loves his country much more to come january 24th china has been working very hard to contain the virus the united states greatly appreciates their efforts in transparency will all work out well in particular on behalf of the american people i want to thank chief president chief january 29th and honestly i think as tough as this negotiation was i think our relationship with china now might be the best in a long long time and now it's reciprocal before we were being ripped off badly now we have a reciprocal relationship even better than reciprocal for us january 30th china is not in great shape right now unfortunately but they're working very hard we'll see what happens but we're working very closely with china and other countries february 7. i just spoke to president xi last night and you know we're working on the problem the virus it's a very tough situation but i think he's going to handle it i think he's handled it really well we're helping wherever we can i could go on and on because he kept saying that and of course it wasn't going well he knew it everybody knew it and it really is unfortunate um but you know the facts are a tough thing as john adams said and these are facts i wish my uh colleagues on the other side were here to hear him because they love to to talk about how that just the world organization the world health organizations do well who's the president too it was in cahoots now um dr jean i have to ask you this you said something very scary at the beginning of your testimony i think you said this we are entering an age of pandemics i think that was a quote um and then you went on to parade the horribles climate change deforestation and all i know that these questions were asked by one of my colleagues but i that really was scary to me this this age of pandemics um and you were talking then about in your answer that we need the infrastructure but i just don't see that materializing i i don't see how we're going to prepare for this because we seem to be thinking not that this is the age of pandemics that this is a 100 year event that's not 100 year event i think it's come back could you comment on that absolutely congressman you know and i i'm not trying to be scary but i i think we have to be realistic about the world we're entering uh the number of novel diseases uh that humans have encountered has gone up dramatically in the last 30 years and largely because most novel diseases in humans come from animals and human animal interactions have changed very substantially in the last 30 years largely due to environmental changes economic growth and then climate change is really driving this and then put all that in in a world which is as globalized as it is i always remind people that china 2003 the original sars outbreak versus china 2019 2020 totally different countries amount of internal and global travel in out of china was about seven fold higher in 2020 2019 than it was in in 2003. so a disease outbreak that begins in one city in one town is across the world within a day or two before anybody's had a chance to detect it that's just the reality and we're not going back to a world where we're going to shut down global travel forever right so we have to live in the world we're in and and to and and that means we've got work to do we've got work to do to build this and if we see this as a once in a hundred year event we are going to find ourselves in very much the same situation and i think the one area where liberals conservatives democrats republicans all agree on is no one wants to go through another 2020 again and i think there's a lot we can do to prevent it but we got to get going as soon as this pandemic winds to an end and i agree with you i was in the insurance business for a while one of the things that was interesting we called these big events cats catastrophes we had a 250-year event a 100-year event these 250-year events because of climate change are happening about every 25 years so it what was before is no longer the case because climate change and we really do have to change the way we're doing business and again i thank you very much my time is up but i appreciate very much all the comments i got to hear so much today that i think is positive and also scary thank you thank you gentlemen yields back and uh he is the last witness and so i want to thank all of today's uh uh he's the last should say witness he's the last member he was testifying a little bit but but uh so i want to thank though all of our witnesses today for their testimony you know i i caught some of it uh and but i've been getting words back from members even on the floor how good uh you were and how informative you were despite the questions you were able to get back with the relevant information uh and your testimony dealing with these efforts the combat code this covet 19 pandemic is is is so so important um let me also thank the ranking member mccall and all the members of this committee for their participation today this pandemic is the greatest challenge the united states and the world uh has faced in generations and just listen to dr job it we've got to be prepared for now and in the future we cannot relax and take it easy and what we've learned i think what is clear is that no country can overcome this global health social economic crisis alone and uh as indicated by all of you also therefore you know we've got to make sure that we're preparing and working in a multilateral way with countries throughout so that we can make sure that we never get to this point again because if it's left this disease this this this virus if it's left unmitigated the coping spread around the world will lead to further mutations that we've been talking about that threaten our own public health here at home so you think that we're safe but we're not until we get rid of it everywhere and and i believe that the united states is in a position to work with the global community in helping distribute vaccines equitably around the world and i and the members of this committee uh will work we'll continue to work with the administration however we can to make sure that we beat this virus once and for all and be prepared for any in the future that's extremely important you can't relax if there's one thing that this virus has shown us and as dr john just indicated you know uh in the world that we currently live in to fact that this is only going to be once in a century is a fallacy uh and so we've got to do all that we can and coordinate uh with uh with with our countries around the world to make sure that everybody uh is uh working collected together so again thank you all thank you for being patient i know there's a lot of questions a lot of members uh and you were here from the beginning to the end i was able to do two or three different and still got here before it was over so i know how it has been for you uh we thank you all uh for for being here for doing that and with that this hearing is now adjourned thank you thank you so much thank you so much for this opportunity chairman thank you thank you dr john we'll see you on cnn bye bye thank you chairman from ups you

xCVI03c14C0,"S. Korea, U.S. hold nuclear planning drill to prepare for potential strike by North Korea","한미 TTX 훈련, 한미일 대북 대응 강화.. 전문가들, 군사적 긴장 고조예상

Over in Washington D.C., the Pentagon said South Korea and the U.S. held a tabletop exercise on Wednesday to prepare for a potential nuclear strike by North Korea.
Our defense ministry correspondent Oh Soo-young tells us more about its significance.

South Korea and the United States practiced coordinating their response to possible nuclear attacks by North Korea for the first time in six years.
The Pentagon said the two sides conducted the Deterrence Strategy Committee's Tabletop Exercise --or TTX --on Wednesday.
The senior-level discussion-based drill was aimed at sharpening the allies' coordination and joint planning to strategize and execute nuclear deterrence.

"".coming to a mutual basis to proceed into a decision of how we're going to react to a North Korean nuclear incident, this is very important. Understanding is the foundation for a good decision. They will not get an answer from these exercises, but they will gain wisdom, which will be critical in a time of very tenuous situation.""

The drill came at a critical time for the allies, followng North Korea's firing of an ICBM last Saturday.
They also held naval missile defense drills with Japan in the East Sea earlier on Wednesday, simulating ballistic missile detection and interception.
More joint exercises are coming up after Seoul and Washington last year agreed to resume the large-scale combined training they had scaled down during the previous Moon administration in hopes of engaging the North.
However, Pyongyang has always used the drills as a pretext for further aggression.
Experts believe the North will continue its nuclear and missile testing, leveraging the growing geopolitical divide between the West and autocratic governments.

""I think that North Korea is encouraged by the collaboration between China and Russia, and also the participation to a certain extent by Iran providing weapons to Russia. I think that it's the mirror image of the way we feel more secure when we have our allies cooperating with us, they will feel more secure when they think that they've got an alliance of those four countries and that their backs will be protected.""

South Korea's military intelligence said Wednesday that the North has improved its ICBM capabilities and is believed to be planning a seventh nuclear test to miniaturize warheads.

for for the country it's it varies it's diverse but the most notable one is of course Manila bays it's already being its accepted so you have thirteen point two millimeters per year up to 2018 two

battle for city four to six centimeters per year and village known popular book Naropa a simulation shows that areas in Malabon Navotas and Manila would be something to beat as deep or about 6.5 feet 40 years from now or by the Year 2060 in the year 2110 the ground could sink by as much as four to ten meters or between 13 to 32 feet while land subsidence is happening on the large scale Manila Bay is experiencing and a celebrated rate at thirteen point four millimeters four times faster than the global average the trend started to peak in the 60s at the height of industrialization so why the sudden increase from the 60s sudden increasing the rate of rise in the record of the tide gauges and I think that's related with population growth so the more the population increases or grows then there's more need for water because all people need water and if there's if there's no supply of water of surface water then they would need to get it from the ground which is fresh water as well scientists say that the phenomenon was made worse by excessive groundwater extraction the effects of this are irreversible once water is extracted from the ground it cannot be filled back due to the lack of waterways renowned urban planner architect Jun Palafox jr. was part of the team that drafted the worldA Bank a funded plan for Metro Manila in the 1970s they proposed an encompassing design that could have eased the crowded capital and balance the effects of development the 70s they were more serious urban planning than infrastructure planning but there was lack of continuity there was good planning but there was no implementation or updating those plans even the water crisis it was addressed in the mid seventies identifying different sources of water supply we lost a lot of opportunities because the Metro can't Manila in the seventies we're as good as the plans for Hong Kong Singapore Kuala Lumpur and in some of our Asian neighbors and so we are now in the cut up situation ultimately an uncontrolled population growth rapid urbanization have led to an oversight on what needed to be done and raised issues of whether the existing laws and regulations were implemented well that happened even after a moratorium on groundwater extraction was imposed a long time ago continuous conversion of land in the Metro and the countryside as well as the growth of agricultural fisheries and commercial industries use large volumes of water and that have put tremendous pressure on the available groundwater resources some of them they have they have permeate some of them they don't that's the problem that's what I'm telling you the problem is regulation of all these water extractors so we don't have the data on those legal extractors even in Metro Manila of course because we did not provide already water permits so some of those we cannot monitor so they start being on their own when you develop in one one fashion and all places are already occupied because of the growing population because of the poor planning then disaster strikes in a crowded mega city such as metro manila and then the perennial problem was that estuaries and creeks were either turned into concrete buildings or filled with heaps of garbage pumping stations like these were made to eliminate garbage that clogged up the waterways to offset the adverse effects of flooding and also to protect and rehabilitate Manila Bay here in tripathi Galena pumping station the garbage being collected in a day can literally fill up a mountain in some instances the machine would just break down because of too much trash is a mandatory massara mock back down guys there's a garbage simply macaque aruna my experience that in you bah bah ha no worse Topanga la Luna Park Milan and when trash was unfiltered because of high volume or mechanical sorting problems they make their way to Manila Bay this worsened siltation in the sea it also added to the rapid increase of sea water level in the area there is a social rationale a for or social explanation and why these kinds of problems and sometimes garbage it's really one of them so now parent garbage field delegate Manila being a

purpose [Music] gee Wilma single coastal road McGee gives you one parent protected my prediction of bagging it open up a possible morning yes duration normalcy what yes doesn't everything rising sea levels resulting from climate change could soon make coastal towns near Manila completely unlivable some areas in Bulacan especially the coastal towns for example have already experienced a land subsidence of up to four centimeters a year everybody's problem and we need to be able to bring the message down to the household level because most the conventional wisdom would probably say that you know I'm an individual what can I do to to to battle the effects of climate change but if we put all together those small efforts it should amount to something and there should be a a a snowballing of efforts and actions adaptation is most specifically so that we can combat the effects of climate change more than four thousand five hundred flood control projects are reported to have been completed since the president Rodrigo Duterte took over the helm of the country almost four years ago the total budget allocated for these projects is equivalent to about 7.3 percent of the country's GDP architect Jun Palafox believes that in the long run reducing the urban density and congestion in cities like Manila is the way forward he suggests relocating government offices to the countryside and revolutionising architectural concepts that adapt to the phenomenon of rising water levels to be part of the solution we should really the original development national development in in fact by by developing more rapidly other urban growth centers like Metro Davao Metro Cebu maybe Metro locos Metro Batangas you reduce the attractiveness of the primacy of Metro Manila even the national government center executive branch of government maybe even the judiciary released at him maybe we should start looking at a new capital region outside Metro Manila that would that would reduce the attractiveness of Metro Manila alleviate traffic lack of housing and many of the urban years that by developing the regions and other areas including relocating the seat of national government we build the houses above the frontlines and when there are no floods you can use the lower lower ground and like this one also you you build the houses on stilts above the flood lines in the future and even this condominium you you left the ground floor open and this flood you just let the floods go underneath the building yeah this is actually for proposal for for condo it smokey mountain for socialized housing for the poor we're in it's not just addressing flooding but vertical that's the word gardens they can reach the suppose here accompany our tomatoes and so on in the ground floor when there's no flooding it can be an activity area for children several decades decades ago there was a move to get government offices away from the city of Manila and that is Khe Sanh CP but since then the population population has grown the development has grown as well from the north the south of Metro Manila it is very much crowded that is what I say when it's it's overwhelming there is very hard to manage Kuala Lumpur they move the government offices to put vijaya and it relieve some pressure to kuala lumpur at that time when the government offices were moved to guess on city there was some kind of relief as well but we have come to a point after several decades that I think there's also a need to move the government offices elsewhere because the population of Metro Manila is extremely large and the hazards are overwhelming in básico Manila when some homes are directly anchored on the seawall of Manila Bay Lisa and her family are prepared to move out but they're still uncertain where and when the relocation will take place if at all [Music] noona mean remove Elena PAGASA marentina bomba en abyme him system unless a sympathy Metallica I see because I see Paloma

these fragile regions of Manila ample scientific evidence has suggested that in about three decades from now the Philippines could find many of its coastal regions as well as those surrounding Manila Bay underwater if countries failed to mitigate the effects of climate change has the country and the government done enough to soften the impact are they well prepared to confront these global challenges and survive in the face of such a looming disaster [Music] [Music] you [Music]"

order in their own image [Music] i can assure you no u.s president will send any single american soldier to fight for the independence of taiwan china china coast guard innovation coast guard calling if you ask me is our relationship normal today my answer to you is no it is not and it cannot be normal if the situation in the border areas is abnormal this is a new world disorder watch out there is definitely a danger of war [Music] july 2021 a major naval exercise is hosted by the u.s and ukraine in the black sea region the exercise involves navies from 32 countries when a british destroyer enters what russia considers its territorial waters russia is provoked and almost fires at the british battleship president putin started the war in ukraine but some analysts point to examples like this to back the claim that nato's behavior provoked russia certainly nato expansionism is not a valid reason for invading a country any invasion of another sovereign state unless it's an act of self-defense or endorsed by the u.n security council is by definition illegal many in china have a different view of how events transpired the chinese government's narrative puts the responsibility on the u.s and nato for the ukraine crisis as cities in ukraine burn and millions flee the chinese media runs stories with quite a the united nations declares it's not aware of any biological weapons programs but the story continues to be pursued in china and the u.s embassy's weibo social media site gets inundated with hate messages [Music] chinese public opinion on the u.s which was bad to begin with plunges to a new low [Music] over in the u.s a momentous shift in u.s public attitudes toward china also took place as the ukraine war continued a poll observes the proportion of americans seeing china as their greatest enemy it doubles in just a year from 22 in 2021 to 45 in 2022 7th of march 2022 the day of chinese foreign minister wang yi's annual media briefing [Music] that is some strong language by foreign minister wang yi your comments please well one thing we should be very clear about is that the biggest geopolitical contest of all time in human history has just broken out between the united states and china whenever major geopolitical contest breaks out watch out there is definitely a danger of war and that's precisely why everybody has to be very careful and work hard to avoid the war before it breaks out and we mustn't put our head in the sand like an ostrich and say hey everything is okay no everything is not okay [Music] the indo-pacific strategy was announced by the biden administration and its key thrusts include a free and open indo-pacific supporting india's continued rise in regional leadership strengthening the quad strengthening extended deterrence with japan and south korea expanding u.s coast guard presence contributing to an empowered asean and closing the region's infrastructure gap through build back better world with g7 partners the strategy paper does not mince its words competition with china is stated as an urgent challenge the united states is a proud part of the indo-pacific and this region is critically important to our nation's security and prosperity our exports to the region support four million american jobs and in 2019 the united states conducted nearly two trillion dollars of two-way trade here all of which underscores america's connection to the indo-pacific in this region we have long put forward a vision of peace and stability freedom on the seas unimpeded commerce advancing human rights a commitment to the international rules-based order we know that beijing continues to coerce to intimidate and to make claims to the vast majority of the south china sea and beijing's actions continue to undermine the rules-based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations the united states stands with our allies and partners in the face of these threats [Music] diamonds this is very dangerous because such attempts may not only miscalculate and may also lead to very dangerous causes of action now with ukraine in the middle of this war hundreds of millions of people are suffering millions of people are fleeing the country for example we need to realize the value of peace and stability we do not want to be hijacked by any single big country in the world onto the bandwagon of war the indo-pacific region is much more heterogeneous than nato they have the same political systems they have similar economic standards and and they're well integrated into into each other's economy where southeast asia and japan and korea we have a variety of government styles we have a variety of commitments to democracy a variety of development levels to equate nato to nato to the quad it really doesn't make sense when parties reference nato they're actually often referring to article 5 which states that there is mutual defense in the event of an attack of any one state the u.s knows that it would be a fool's errand to seek to bind countries in the region to a mutual defense treaty because you know southeast asian countries in particular all have different interests and different positions vis-a-vis china as well as one another i do not think that the us is trying to build nato in southeast asia [Music] [Music] as a majority of australians condemn russian action in ukraine australia's leader makes an important speech about a possible new world order our rules-based international order built upon the principles and values that guide our own nation has for decades supported peace and stability and allowed sovereign nations to pursue their interests free from coercion this is now under assault a new arc of autocracy is instinctively aligning to challenge them and reset the world order in their own image a day after the speech the australian government announces plans to build a nuclear-powered submarine base on the country's east coast the cost 10 billion australian dollars the base will facilitate the docking of nuclear submarines like this one the sudden announcement of plans for the base is an acceleration of what was originally an 18-month evaluation the august agreement was signed between the us uk and australia in september 2021. under august the united states and britain will assist australia in its acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines australia's top intelligence chief warned that china is intent on establishing global preeminence and says its troubling strategic convergence with russia will pose new threats to liberal democracies like australia [Music] trump how did ties between australia and china get so bad from 2009 to 2019 trade between china and australia tripled transforming china into australia's largest trade partner china has also emerged as australia's largest source of international students and mandarin as australia's second most spoken language in 2014 both countries even described their relationship as a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a free trade agreement [Music] in 2017 54 of australians pool had trust in china to act responsibly in the world so between 2009 and 2019 australia's trade with china tripled that was largely driven by this huge increase in demand for products particularly commodities that helped to fuel china's growth two-way trade between australia and china was extraordinarily high forty percent of outbound trade from australia went up north to beijing that's one of the highest levels of trade uh between advanced countries and even between any countries in the world then in 2017 trouble started there was first a government study and then it began to work out into the public that there was increasing chinese state interference inside of australia there was a well-publicized story of an australian politician an australian senator taking money from a ccp linked entity and then copying china's talking points in contravention to where his own party stood 1.2 million australians are chinese or of chinese ancestry now what we saw was increasingly the chinese government was reaching into various ethnic communities a number of different ways so first of all working to control the chinese language presses making sure that individuals and companies had no funding for independent journalism if they said anything that was contrary to the line of the chinese state media organs number two we saw that increasingly within communication systems wechat and others that various channels of conversation were shut down on particularly around election time when anyone said something that was in contravention to how china viewed this situation at one point several years ago australia was in the midst of negotiating an extra territoriality agreement with the chinese whether or not you know those who have been accused or convicted of crimes can be exported back to their own countries this was a contentious debate within australia particularly as china looked increasingly authoritarian at home but the minister of state security from china was down talking about this and called in labor who was in the opposition and to labor leadership said you need to support this because if not it would be awful if the entire ethnic uh a chinese population in australia all of a sudden left you and supported a different party that is not even a veiled threat that's an out and out threat to change your domestic politics to make sure that they align with what china wants and that set off alarm bells within labor party no less within the government the liberal party as well yes in 2018 52 of australians poll had trust in china to act responsibly in the world that same year australia passed the espionage and foreign interference act which was implicitly directed at china the government also announced that huawei and zte were not allowed to build the 5g network in australia then in 2020 the pandemic gripped the world when the australian government suggested an independent investigation into where the virus started and how it spread china was and remains outraged canberra's relationship with beijing is now at rock bottom what followed was a trade war beijing has launched a second investigation into australian wine imports accusing canberra of giving subsidies to give firms an edge over local rivals australia says a coal import ban by china would be a clear breach of wto rules china has suspended indefinitely high-level economic talks with australia beijing says the decision affects all activities under the china-australia's strategic economic dialogue in 2020 23 of australians poll had trust in china to act responsibly in the world 77 did not trust china to act responsibly now when that economic hammer began to come down you can see widespread anger and a push swelling up from the ground up that the australian government needs to do more to promote trade with other countries in 2021 16 of australians polled had trust in china to act responsibly in the world 84 did not trust china to act responsibly in september 2021 august was formed [Music] our world is becoming more complex especially here in our region the indo-pacific this affects us all the future of the indo-pacific will impact all our futures and so friends orchestra a new enhanced trilateral security partnership between australia the united kingdom and the united states orcas a partnership where our technology our scientists our industry our defence forces are all working together to deliver a safer and more secure region that ultimately benefits all the first major initiative of august will be to deliver a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for australia the uk australia and the us will be joined even more closely together reflecting the measure of trust between us the depth of our friendship and the enduring strength of our shared values of freedom and democracy so arcus has broad bipartisan support in australia in fact both the government that signed it and the opposition party have signaled that they are on board for this and all three countries britain the uk and the united states are working overtime to make sure that the way that they go about setting up the nuclear propulsion submarines does not enhance nuclear proliferation and in fact might even be able to strengthen it by limiting it just to this technology and making sure that there are no bleed on effects to nuclear weapons that's not what this is although there's a lot of dis disinformation in the system that this is a gateway to a nuclear weapons program which both parties have said it is not and they will not continue it if it is 10 billion dollars to spend on nuclear submarines is a lot of money do australians really believe that china is going to sail all the way down under and launch an offensive what's happened in the south china sea has not stayed in the south china sea and as china has continued to build up their military forces they've continued to push outward and further down and closer to australia so we've seen multiple attempts by the chinese to do a similar spate of building that they conduct in the south china sea in the south pacific we've seen discussions and talks about whether or not there would be a dual-use military commercial base in papua new guinea in vanuatu and even just this past month in the solomon islands all of these are much closer to australia the orcas treaty is a very dangerous thing because australia for all these decades has claimed itself to be a very proud member of the non-nuclear proliferation treaty and a proud member of the south pacific nuclear-free zone and as a result they benefited hugely from this and i think now at urging of the united states and united kingdom the australian government wants to deprive the australian people their rare privilege of living in this bubble of nuclear-free south pacific or protection of the nuclear free non-proliferation treaty this is dangerous for the australian people as well as for countries and peoples in our part of the world submarines are stealthy but trade agreements are stealthier so it's much better to protect security in this region by countries developing patterns of cooperation and interdependence as we are going to do with the world's largest free trade agreement the regional comprehensive economic partnership that was uh launched in january 2022 with by the way australia japan south korea china uh also as members of this trade agreement the quad or quadrilateral security dialogue has australia japan india and the us as member countries there are joint military exercises parallel to the dialogue like exercise malabar a naval exercise conducted off the coast of guam the exercise began in 1992 between the indian and u.s navies japan has been a permanent partner in the exercise since 2015. in the 2021 edition of exercise malabar australia participated for the second time as the malabar exercise drew to a close in 2021 india rolled out the red carpet for u.s defense officials in new delhi meridian pintoda the quad countries present a different point of view besides military exercises and security discussions the quad includes cooperation on vaccine partnerships climate change action counterterrorism and infrastructure development if you looked at the quad three or four years ago it would have been focused more on maritime security today the quad has evolved to focus on the provision of public goods so vaccine production in india and distribution to emerging countries the provision of infrastructure and connectivity aid to southeast asia and south asia and we also see now investment in the selective diversification of supply chains throughout the region so i think that is important from japan's point of view in that it's providing a public good to the critical re partners as japan understands in the indo-pacific and that southeast asia and south asia without shifting away from a security view of the quad it's not going to get buy-in from southeast asian countries vietnam indonesia malaysia singapore the quad members have collectively pledged to donate more than 1 billion doses of vaccines globally by the end of 2022. [Music] in southeast asia a hotbed of u.s china rivalry the quad has gotten a mixed response southeast asia in general has been more wary about the more muscular security oriented dimensions of the u.s into pacific strategy and the quad is one of that or at least was one of that um i think their main concern with the quad was that it would heighten tensions in the region especially vis-a-vis china i think the quadrilateral security dialogue has also positioned itself it's moved away from its more militaristic elements to focusing on areas that asean cares more about so areas like pandemic recovery and that by demonstrating a sensitivity to the region's needs i think the position on the quad dialogue has softened somewhat [Music] the quad disease is somewhat of a mystery if you talk to the members of quad they deny that it is an anti-china alliance but everybody in the world perceives the quad to be an anti-china alliance and it creates this rather strange situation where the four countries deny that it is aimed against china but the perception is that it is against china which is why if you notice not many other east asian countries uh have volunteered to join it and so uh it's therefore important for the members of the quad to actually explain what exactly is the end game of the quad if you look at the uh last quad foreign minister's joint statement asean centrality was right up at the top everybody understands that the thing that brings the four quad members together is their shared anxieties about china but the quad members also understand that the way they prove that they're worth siding with is by delivering public goods might there be deeper engagement between asean and the quad developments in the south china sea are likely to steer the conversation china coast guard china coast guard coast guard calling one hour away from singapore work has commenced on a u.s funded indonesian maritime training center the training center will be owned and operated by indonesia's maritime security agency bakum [Music] berkamla is a coordinating board for maritime security it's an inter agencies department responsible to safeguarding the maritime security indonesia and it involves navy the ministry of fisheries as well as other ministries relevant ministries it is led by a navy admiral indonesian navy plays a big role in the day-to-day work at bakamla but um the location is very strategic it is close to the strait of malacca as well as the south china sea indonesia needs to upgrade its navy and also its maritime capacity having defense cooperation is one of the best ways for the purpose and we are aware that the u.s has a lot at stake in defending the freedom of navigation in the state of malacca and the south china sea [Music] according to the u.s department of state indonesia received nearly 39 million dollars in the year 2020 from the u.s part of the funds are targeted for spending on military education military financing and security assistance the bakum law project is of significance because bakum law is the agency tasked with overseeing indonesia's territorial waters and its exclusive economic zone bakama has intensified sea patrols in recent years after chinese fishing boats escorted by the chinese coast guard sailed into what indonesia regards as its territory beijing of course has a different view on who owns these seas china coast guard china coast guard innovation coast guard calling magic this is hanako yes sir please move away and go back to your territory sir no no we are coming out portugal in this area another justification of the people republic of china china has an imputable sovereignty over the island in south china sea i order you so to leave this territory i order you to leave this territory take your fishing board or leave them away this event occurred at the natuna islands in the south china sea china claims most of the south china sea as its traditional fishing grounds around october 2021 china sent a diplomatic correspondence to indonesia demanded indonesia to halt the drilling activities in the national waters it's oil drilling it's uh for for indonesia park so we have drilling activities within the national waters within our maritime rights they said it it is within their so-called historic rights [Music] i think this is a bit unfortunate for both sides because in my opinion china should not drag indonesia further into the whirlpool of the south china sea the waters in the philippines are much more turbulent in may 2021 close to 200 chinese vessels were moored in the contested area in the south china sea prompting fears that beijing was building a naval base there we now understand why it is that the philippine authorities now have taken such a tone of concern and a ton of defiance against china in terms of what's going on in the west philippine sea we saw nothing less than what you would call a swarm of chinese vessels particularly in areas that are close to the artificial islands that are built by china uh one particular reef was quite unsettling to see it's called gavin reef around it you could see easily a hundred ships and it's it's quite hard to be accurate about it from a moving plane up above especially since some of these ships are being tied together um as edges to appear as one group we saw similar formations in the bullion tradition just a few weeks ago responding to the events in may 2021 the foreign affairs secretary used less than diplomatic language he later apologized more recently in march 2022 a chinese coast guard vessel sailed dangerously close to another vessel from the philippine coast guard with a distance of just about 19 meters accidents are not unlikely in the last year or so there have been a lot of movements in the west philippine sea concerning chinese militia chasing filipino fishermen who are fishing in our own waters when we speak of filipino fishermen usually these are just small boats trawlers they're not organized at all the militia on the other hand they have been proven to be organized efforts they have bigger boats more sophisticated technology and equipment so they can really track down where where the filipino fisher folks are and chase them down or chase them away from supposedly chinese waters many believe it is china's assertiveness in the south china sea that is giving a boost to the u.s indo-pacific strategy and things like orcas when you talk about the south china sea just allow me to make several very brief points we do not need to go further into asian time we can just go to the end of the second world war i do not need to remind all of us that during the second world war japan was occupying all the islands and reefs and the talls in the south china sea when japan unconditionally surrendered in 1945 do you know to whom japan surrendered all the islands and reefs and atolls in the south china sea japan unconditionally surrendered everything to china why because it was dictated partially by the united states it was because during the second world war china was the only country standing on its feet in this part of the world fighting against japanese occupation in 1945 there were no independent vietnam there was no independent malaysia there was no independent philippines there was no independent indonesia for example all these were still colonies okay this is a bit sensitive but i'm trying to to clarify this okay no available historical record can show if china performed uninterrupted continuous [Music] act of sovereignty over the spartly islands prior to the japanese occupation in 1939 and after the second world war japan relinquished the title over the spartly islands but it was not clear whether any party or any state would inherit the claim so there is no historical document that supports our beijing's claim the permanent court of arbitration at the hague dismissed beijing's claim to much of the south china sea in 2016. baby as filipinos go to the polls the issue has been a subject of debate if you look at existing public opinion surveys a lot of filipinos would like a government that would be more assertive that would use the arbitral ruling that would exhaust all means and and that would not adopt a defeatist attitude towards the issue simply because we're up against a a major power and in this campaign i think a lot of the presidential candidates are tapping into that by saying that i will be stronger than the current president the current administration i would be more assertive in 2020 my colleagues and i conducted a study on perceptions of the filipino strategic community regarding which country would be our preferred partner a majority of them actually said that they prefer to be partners with japan the united states and australia so these are our traditional partners china is way down in the list of preferred partners [Music] the china factor does play a very big role in the balikatan exercises they are also holding exercises regarding patriot missiles of the united states so we can assume that this is part of the different theater scenarios and this is likely in preparation for china's next move in taiwan or whatever might happen in the south china sea [Music] the russia-ukraine conflict or war has been a an important uh debate in the philippines there's this chilling effect to a lot of other small states that if um behavior like this by superpowers are tolerated then no small state is safe a lot of people are saying that now there's an opportunity for other hegemonic powers to also flex their muscle and impose their view of regional orders here in asia particularly china and uh given its uh assertiveness in the south china sea for example [Applause] if for example after the may 2022 elections existing military arrangements with the united states would be reinvigorated that means that u.s presence would be what we will see in the coming years because prior to the end of the cold war the largest military installations outside u.s territory is in the philippines uh the subic naval base and the clark airfield were critical in the projection of u.s military power in its wars in korea in vietnam and in other places in the asia pacific in case of a flashpoint happening in the taiwan strait then the philippines can be requested for this logistical hubs to be used but i think it really depends whether the new administration after the may 2022 elections will be a bit more open or flexible to this the united states made a major mistake in underestimating duterte's chances and not developing a relationship with him before he took office so then washington was blindsided by this new president's anti-americanism when anybody could have told him that duterte had been anti-american since his college days i think now you're going to see the u.s much more aware of the fact that the alliance is strategically too important to play games with like this the u.s must engage with whoever wins and look americans don't get to vote it doesn't matter if the us government likes a certain philippine president it doesn't matter if that would have been their preference the us government's job is to uphold the alliance commitment to the philippine people whoever their president is the philippines and the us are now beginning to have the kind of conversations that the u.s has had with japan and korea and australia and nato for three decades and part of that conversation is obviously what are the philippines responsibilities including if there were a contingency in taiwan that involved danger to american service members [Music] phobia ancients has your general um southeast asian countries need to stop thinking or stop framing their choice so much as a choice between the united states and china rather they need to think about the choice that lays before them as one that um supports rules-based international order and the rule of law or a world where you know might becomes right and to me the choice is very clear in that situation i choose the former i would not like to see the world and particularly not the region descending into a situation where might is right and we've seen um what happens in a scenario such as that in the case of russia's invasion of ukraine there's a new giant in our neighborhood but that doesn't mean we kowtow but we must we must speak to them clearly and firmly but not provocatively and that can be done you know i was a diplomat for 33 years they say that a definition of a diplomat is someone who can tell you to go to hell in such a way that he feels he's going to enjoy the journey to health now this is the art we have to learn to do we have to tell china to go to hell on some issues like the south china sea but we do it in such a way that the chinese are going to enjoy the journey so that's what diplomacy is about there's gonna be [Music]
S2KtLTXXej8,"Rodrigo Duterte on drugs, death and diplomacy | Talk to Al Jazeera","It's been about 100 days into the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. 

Since he took power, the Philippine president has overseen the killing of more than 3,500 people in his war on drugs, offended world leaders and strained relations with the US.

In an exclusive first interview since he was sworn in, we talk to Duterte about his controversial war on drugs and foreign policy - including deteriorating relations with the United States and potentially warming relations with China.

""We have three million drug addicts, and it's growing. So if we do not interdict this problem, the next generation will be having a serious problem ... You destroy my country, I'll kill you. And it's a legitimate thing. If you destroy our young children, I will kill you. That is a very correct statement. There is nothing wrong in trying to preserve the interest of the next generation."" 

But Duterte admits that children and innocent people have also been killed in the bloody crackdown, and promises to investigate these extrajudicial killings, but he also says calls them ""collateral damage"".

When asked about the contested South China Sea, Duterte says: 

""We will not give up anything there; it's an entitlement ... You can only negotiate to prevent a war ... They invited me for talks, and I will go.""

since he was sworn in we talked to him about his controversial war on drugs and foreign policy including deteriorating relations with the United States and potentially warming relations with China the president of the Republic of the Philippines Rodrigo Rojo detected talks to al-jazeera mr. president thank you for talking to Al Jazeera it's been a tumultuous start to the presidency for you full of controversy particularly about the war on drugs but first let's start with your background you were raised in a politically inclined family your father was a governor your mother was a freedom fighter during the reign of former President Ferdinand Marcos how was that affected your outlook profoundly I would say I grew up in a environment of politics and as politicians we tend to you know we go by the issues of the day the big was the road of fact the conditions economy and all especially the political issues and what my father was governor for 10 years or more but when he died I was I was then a prosecutor and when the revolution came my mother was one of the stalwarts of the opposition against Marco you also had some difficult times when you were younger as a child you have revealed that you were sexually abused by a priest it has that shaped your beliefs is that shaped helped to shape who you are now yes the large extent actually it's uh what you get along the way that shapes your character especially and even you're at that time even your politics and uh how you look at the world and how you should assess them by the standards of use in school and in growing up the things that you pick up along the way he said sorts of a blend into a coalition it blends it to something which is big can be said forming your own values in life let's talk about the war on drugs now three and a half thousand people have been killed so far it seems like the whole world is talking about it at the moment the Philippines seems to have so many problems so why launch what is a brutal war on drugs because the sheer number of people contaminated will pull them play country now it will destroy the next generation of Latinos you know this lives lost some of them were lost during legitimate encounters with the police but the fact is at the moment we have three and a half thousand people killed and you yourself alluded to just then that perhaps some of them weren't legitimate targets you know there is no crime at all when you threaten criminals with death in my country at least there is no law which says I can have threatened criminals and that was the favorite but of course the de clichy that they used it became a cliche over time and when I was president I said we have three million according to Padilla three million drug addicts not counting mine because it's still going on so I said if we do not end up dick this problem the next generation will be having a serious problem and I found that again same you destroy my country I'll kill you and it's a legitimate thing if you destroy our young children I will kill you that is a very correct statement there is nothing wrong in trying to preserve the interest of the next generation that three million addicts it's not they are not a residence of one compact area or contiguous place they're spread all over the country and by the sheer number because if you are a user you must push unless you are the son of a millionaire or because you have to sustain your addiction by getting another financier for you and then at the next financier will have to get a new victim to finance that's what it became that is how drugs is a spread but it was not until I became president that the widespread and the magnitude of the problem became really a serious issue so what about the children and the innocent people have been killed this is bad so will those cases be investigated you give up do you promise that all those but let me tell you this is the law of my my London here is a police here is a gangster his arm between m16 because they're only a pistol but when they meet the exchanged fire with the police with an m16 it's one bus prep and hits 1000 people there under die this is criminal liability it could not be negligence because you have to save your life it could not be recklessness because you have to defend yourself just like when the United States and the rest of the country when you bomb the building's you intend to kill the militants but you kill in the process the children there it's only how it is explained and we are you know people judged best when they condemn so you would always flip place you in a bad light but the situation does not comfort it and it explains the reason why until now I have yet to hear an apology for those who have in Vietnam in Afghanistan never mind about the militants kill them we will but then in depressive to families hospital or as collateral damage then why is it it is equilateral damage the West and to us it is murder you went to law school yeah you worked hard to be part of the legal system you are a lawyer by profession good and you were a prosecutor for many years yes do you still believe in the country's judicial system right now I should believe in the system because I will guarantee this time that they law this way there are judges here in Manila more than 1000 cases no conviction at all of a drug case that is where punish blows the well maybe savagery threatening people on both sides that is how it is played here that's why we are this miserable thing about the drug problem no but do you agree do you acknowledge that you have encouraged vigilante killings no I said I will kill you if I encourage fine yes but the point is that people can get away with murder right now and you know that some of the killings are not legitimate well so do you think that there might be cases of people settling old scores out there and dessert and disguising them as the war on drugs I do not play with conjectures I do not make assumptions I just say what I should be saying as a precedent under Samiha now if the criminals they are killed by the thousands that's not my problem my problem is how to take care of the law-abiding god-fearing young persons of this Republic because they are resources strictly speaking you do cannot find any redeeming factor in being you know the criminals are there there for what the other for the just like the cartel in maximum if you have read young litleo this is how the cookie crumbles exactly so when I make a purchase I will kill you because MDMA or I am the president now if the Vigilant they will take over but you know I cannot control it I cannot be God and control everything okay you just kill these guys or you wait for the courts do that well you can encourage good policing and you can encourage justice and trust in the judicial system but when I was campaigning as a president the drug problem was already reaching by the millions well 3 million is 3 million now during my time we have started to count we are nearing now the 800 mark 800,000 by the year end ends I would have about also a million so I have 4 million drug addict do you think that's that's an easy number No so why not put all the energy into rehabilitation what do you find it reforming health care ok oh uh gun company we cut this for a while I just heard a soldier ok ok hit up again appeal newspaper Capone he wants to show you the news oh sure sure enough okay so you were saying about this facility sir what is this about this is a rehab facility built by somebody this is what they click rided you know the third day he should have built harihar houses instead of killing the criminals the drug lords you know this would cost millions I entered the presidency of the Republic of the Philippines mid theorem there is nothing at all left in the budget for this year which was prepared by my predecessor which was also prepared the other year to be implemented this year the implementation does not contain any money because nobody until I became president of this country nobody realized how widespread how dimensional it was sir in the past during the campaign and weeks into your presidency you have repeatedly said that you have no regard for human rights but human rights is actually part of the Constitution and as a head of state it is also part your duty to uphold the Constitution how does that connect I would rather intimidate and strike fear in the hearts of the criminals just like what happened in Davao when finally you can walk the streets walk about in the streets at night and you can eat anywhere at any time and nobody but nobody would bother you it's happening dabao Davao City is in the midst of Mindanao it's Robert lon but I can assure you as plenty of people have been there it's a destination for conventions and conferences international it's always elected so it's booming it is a little bit rich than the others why because we can live or knives or lives normally and of course business contract so that when I said I do not care about what the human rights guys say I have a duty to preserve the generation if it involves human rights I don't give a [ __ ] I have to strike fear because I have I said the intimus of the states are out there to destroy the children are you not worried about possible ramifications in the future for you a possible impeachment or being tried in the international court good question before you can begin you must determine that I have committed the crime in my country that I have committed mass murders in my country and then charged with them there can be no ratification when I say that I will kill you if you destroy my London it's illegitimate it says it's a legitimate statement the of any general of any work I'm president of ad tribal leader to say those things of course you said there could be consequences but I am not worried about this thing I do not make any projections how many vigilante killings well if you compare the four million to the to the three thousand - legitimate encounters between the law enforcers and the criminals give give or take even a half of it so what is it - the lives already lost I have four million addicts to take care of and I have been criticized I would say well why don't just you know the dirt they build rehab centers and just place them there when ready to kill him look I am embed term president in the sense that I entered this year the presidency the only this year the budget for this year was prepared by my predecessor so Aquino and it binds me because it would last until December nowhere in this budget provides enough money to build even two buildings Aubry hub structures it's all what is left of my government now after the election is just enough for the M or e or e maintenance and all so he sings you not know capital outlays the budget of President Aquino for this year the last six months does not include any rehabilitation because the problem was there but there was nobody minding the store I was the only mayor brave enough to say those things so my seat City well got the benefits of a peaceful place where you can where you can eat work safely but the others we did not know but they allowed so many administration's to flourish and it was done until I became president between you realized that there were already according to at the time those generals generals and cello of the Padilla Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency that there are already three million addicts so never mind my counting because I'm still counting up to the end of the year are you in favor of medicinal marijuana yes but that is a very long process it has to be something like being officially certified by the food and drugs of the Philippines and it must have this qualifying you know activity where it's being used to find out if it's really a medicinal or if it can do something good for the body but should consider it you'd consider it legalization of it for example III I'm not the authority for that it's the Food and Drug Administration which I said it's good okay if it is certified by the government that it's good fine no problem I don't think anyone could deny doesn't matter how controversial it is that you've delivered on your election campaign promise to crackdown on drugs one thing you haven't delivered on yet is your promise to ride a jet ski out to the disputed territory in the South China Sea and plant the Philippine flag on there now many people many voters I assume took that as a sign that you were going to be tough on China in that disputed territory in the South China Sea or the West Philippine Sea but you haven't been why you really think that I would go there riding I don't even own a jet no I don't but if people perceive that as a sign that you were going to get tough with it I was a hyperbola literally table you cannot expect oh right I don't even know how to swim and if it overturns and you lose a president along the way so why did you say that then what were you referring here a hyperbola to stress a point that we will not we will not give up anything there but your statements recently tend to indicate that you are willing to give up some territory there no it does our nobody is going to give up my Madrid the readjustment I thought that it's enough able you cannot I cannot give it up nobody can give it up nobody in the Constitution allows anybody to give it up even the president cannot give it up those are our entitlements this is an island everybody every country in this world is given its own fishpond that's your Fishman where you get to fish the shares and everything you cannot give it up you can only negotiate to prevent war remember that we're ok I'll push your logic to the logical conclusion we have this judgment right two things I can do I can go into a rage because it's being occupied but remember it is not a sovereign and it is there is the entitlement attached to it if the sovereignty okay the order is to go into a rage and fight and the other is the top what do you think will happen to my country if I choose to go to work a fight alone oh I would call upon the other countries to help me who who died for my country except us so we can only talk and that's why they invited me for talks I will go but I will go with this paper a blank she's a president yeah I said this is the award I cannot go out beyond the boundaries of this paper come on let's talk let's begin here the Philippines want a landmark case against China unprecedented in recent history a smaller country standing up to a superpower it declared the nine - claim of China invalid now you're going to China and you've mentioned previously you said that you will not insist on the position of the Philippines on the Scarborough Shoal now your critics are questioning why it seems you're going to China and negotiating from a position of weakness rather than abstract it would be arrogant to me to go there and say I'm going there to fight for this and that you know there's much to be learned in history and even in the books and the way the orientalis places the words in small especially the Chinese you have to go there with a little bit of courtesy but when you are already in front which are Ghana then I said this is it we do not do what would be I go what would be the purpose in going there without for what but you can guarantee to the Philippine people that you are not going to sign away or give up hope of give up fighting for the Spratlys Scarborough Shoal if they are Philippine territory nobody but nobody not even the president of this country can give up the claim you're not allowed to do that that this one's sure we are going to impeachment but can you guarantee that you will fight - yeah - nobody is going to give up anything that I said if the Constitution does not allow you then who can they're not even your mouth as that's how it is what do you see hoping to do when you go to China well maybe we talk about I would no no I would that put the wherewithal so we would start then the judgmental thing would come come in - for then some other matters of both trade and commerce and if there's any arrangement is going to come it or happy compromise 10 per week we can talk about entitlements of the China Sea but really I cannot predict on on any solid thing to talk about until em though so uh I am not there until I am there will you discuss the war on drugs because records show that a lot of the drugs coming into the Philippines are coming from China understand it that's why I'd like to help but you're not china knows you democracy I mean the Communist is just something which is just you think to go buy keep control but everything there is a free enterprise having said that mr. president you have clearly moved away from the United States why do you think it is necessary for the country to distance itself from its long-standing ally in Asia our exclusive interview with the Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte will continue on the next episode of talk to Al Jazeera"
L1codx6AsR4,Arbitral Tribunal on South China Sea Disputes not Primary Judicial Branch of UN: Former ICJ Judge,"The Arbitral Tribunal, which issued a so-called award on the South China Sea arbitration, is not a primary judicial branch of the United Nations, said a former judge of the International Court of Justice. 

""The Arbitral Tribunal which rendered the award yesterday, that is a body which was set up under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is not the International Court of Justice and it is a temporary body,"" he said. 

Abdul G. Koroma said the International Court of Justice is the principal, the main judicial organ of the UN, but the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which filed the South China Sea arbitration case with the unilateral request from the former government of the Philippines, is a temporary administrative temporary body. 

""The Permanent Court of Arbitration, the PCA, and the International Court of Justice share the same building in The Hague which is called the Peace Palace. So it's not very easy for a non-lawyer to be able to make the distinction between the two bodies,"" said Koroma. 

""The Permanent Court of Arbitration, it's a body which acts as the administrative body of arbitral tribunal. So states that have to exchange documents, pleadings, they use the PCA for that purpose. The PCA, of course, it has other functions. It's also responsible for investment disputes and so on and so forth,"" he said. 

The former judge said the purpose of any arbitral settlement is to bring peaceful resolution of a conflict, rather than for any political uses. 

""One should never lose sight of the fact that the purpose of an arbitral settlement, or it's not an end in itself. It's a means to an end - that is the peaceful resolution of a conflict. A tribunal or a court should never lose sight of that,"" he said. 

China rejects the jurisdiction of the arbitration on the South China Sea disputes unilaterally initiated by the Philippines. 

The award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal is null and void and has no binding force, said a white paper the State Council released on Wednesday.

https://www.facebook.com/TED",1,"I'm going to talk today
about energy and climate. And that might seem a bit surprising, because my full-time work
at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need
to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion
live better lives. But energy and climate
are extremely important to these people; in fact, more important
than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means
that many years, their crops won't grow: there will be too much rain,
not enough rain; things will change in ways their fragile
environment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation, it leads
to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. So, the climate changes
will be terrible for them. Also, the price of energy
is very important to them. In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty,
by far you would pick energy. Now, the price of energy
has come down over time. Really advanced civilization
is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled
the Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s,
we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have
refrigerators, air-conditioning; we can make modern materials
and do so many things. And so, we're in a wonderful situation
with electricity in the rich world. But as we make it cheaper --
and let's say, let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2. CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2
is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase
leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather;
perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems
can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses. Now, the exact amount of how you map
from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be,
and where the positive feedbacks are -- there's some uncertainty there,
but not very much. And there's certainly uncertainty
about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists
on this several times: Do we really have to get
down to near zero? Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? And the answer is,
until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. And so that's a big challenge. It's very different than saying, ""We're a twelve-foot-high truck
trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under."" This is something that has to get to zero. Now, we put out a lot
of carbon dioxide every year -- over 26 billion tons. For each American, it's about 20 tons. For people in poor countries,
it's less than one ton. It's an average of about five tons
for everyone on the planet. And somehow, we have to make changes
that will bring that down to zero. It's been constantly going up. It's only various economic changes
that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go
from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero. This equation has four factors,
a little bit of multiplication. So you've got a thing on the left,
CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based
on the number of people, the services each person
is using on average, the energy, on average, for each service, and the CO2 being put out
per unit of energy. So let's look at each one of these, and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably, one of these numbers is going
to have to get pretty near to zero. (Laughter) That's back from high school algebra. But let's take a look. First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job
on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by,
perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see
an increase of about 1.3. The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. These are very good things. Getting rid of poverty means
providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. And it's a great thing
for this number to go up. In the rich world, perhaps
the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number,
on average, is going to go up, and so, overall,
that will more than double the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service: Do you have lighting in your house
to be able to read your homework? And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading
their schoolwork under the street lamps. Now, efficiency, ""E,""
the energy for each service -- here, finally we have some good news. We have something that's not going up. Through various inventions
and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars,
different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy
for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services
even bring it down by 90 percent. There are other services,
like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement
are far, far less. And so overall, if we're optimistic,
we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even,
perhaps, a factor of six. But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion
to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it. So let's look at this fourth factor --
this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2
put out per each unit of energy. So the question is:
Can you actually get that to zero? If you burn coal, no. If you burn natural gas, no. Almost every way
we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables
and nuclear, puts out CO2. And so, what we're going to have
to do at a global scale, is create a new system. So we need energy miracles. Now, when I use the term ""miracle,""
I don't mean something that's impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services
are a miracle. So the people here have participated
in the creation of many miracles. Usually, we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle
by a certain date. Usually, you just kind of stand by,
and some come along, some don't. This is a case where we actually
have to drive at full speed and get a miracle
in a pretty tight timeline. Now, I thought, ""How could
I really capture this? Is there some kind
of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab
people's imagination here?"" I thought back to a year ago
when I brought mosquitoes, and somehow people enjoyed that. (Laughter) It really got them involved
in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitoes. With energy, all I could
come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution
to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I'm told they don't bite; in fact,
they might not even leave that jar. (Laughter) Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky
solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much. We need solutions, either one or several, that have unbelievable scale
and unbelievable reliability. And although there's many directions
that people are seeking, I really only see five
that can achieve the big numbers. I've left out tide,
geothermal, fusion, biofuels. Those may make some contribution, and if they can do better
than I expect, so much the better. But my key point here
is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them
because they look daunting, because they all have
significant challenges. Let's look first at burning fossil fuels, either burning coal
or burning natural gas. What you need to do there seems
like it might be simple, but it's not. And that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it,
going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid,
put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. Now, we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80
percent level. But getting up to that full percentage --
that will be very tricky. And agreeing on where these CO2
quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here
is this long-term issue: Who's going to be sure? Who's going to guarantee something that is literally
billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of
in terms of nuclear or other things? This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one. Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems: cost, particularly in highly
regulated countries, is high; the issue of safety, really feeling good
about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have
these human operators, the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste? Although it's not very large,
there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems
that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on. The last three of the five,
I've grouped together. These are what people often refer to
as the renewable sources. And they actually -- although it's great
they don't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy
gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,
thousands of times more area than you think of
as a normal energy plant. Also, these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn't shine all day,
it doesn't shine every day, and likewise, the wind
doesn't blow all the time. And so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way
of getting the energy during those time periods
that it's not available. So we've got big cost challenges here. We have transmission challenges; for example, say this energy source
is outside your country, you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk
of the energy coming from elsewhere. And, finally, this storage problem. To dimensionalize this, I went through and looked
at all the types of batteries made -- for cars, for computers, for phones,
for flashlights, for everything -- and compared that to the amount
of electrical energy the world uses. What I found is that all
the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes
of all the energy. And so, in fact, we need
a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be
a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now. It's not impossible,
but it's not a very easy thing. Now, this shows up when you try
to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent
of what you're using. If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery. Now, how are we going to go forward
on this -- what's the right approach? Is it a Manhattan Project?
What's the thing that can get us there? Well, we need lots of companies
working on this -- hundreds. In each of these five paths,
we need at least a hundred people. A lot of them, you'll look at
and say, ""They're crazy."" That's good. And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people
who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies,
including one called eSolar that has some great
solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla is investing
in dozens of companies that are doing great things
and have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I
actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly,
is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations
in nuclear: modular, liquid. Innovation really stopped
in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some
good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. The idea of TerraPower is that,
instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent, which is the U235 -- we decided, ""Let's burn
the 99 percent, the U238."" It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact, people had talked
about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly
whether it would work or not, and so it's through the advent
of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate
and see that, yes, with the right materials approach,
this looks like it would work. And because you're burning
that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste,
and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste
from today's reactors. So instead of worrying about them,
you just take that, it's a great thing. It breeds this uranium as it goes along,
so it's kind of like a candle. You see it's a log there, often
referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel,
this really solves the problem. I've got a picture here
of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they've taken out
the part they burn now, so it's called depleted uranium. That would power the US
for hundreds of years. And simply by filtering seawater
in an inexpensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire
lifetime of the rest of the planet. So, you know, it's got lots
of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many
hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. So let's think: How should
we measure ourselves? What should our report card look like? Well, let's go out to where
we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. For 2050, you've heard many people
talk about this 80 percent reduction. That really is very important,
that we get there. And that 20 percent will be used up
by things going on in poor countries -- still some agriculture; hopefully,
we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries,
including countries like China, will have had to switch
their electricity generation altogether. The other grade is: Are we deploying
this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it
in all the developed countries and are in the process
of getting it elsewhere? That's super important. That's a key element
of making that report card. Backing up from there, what should
the 2020 report card look like? Well, again, it should have
the two elements. We should go through these efficiency
measures to start getting reductions: The less we emit,
the less that sum will be of CO2, and therefore, the less the temperature. But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us
all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly
less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation
on these breakthroughs. These breakthroughs,
we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that
in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things
that have been changed. There's a lot of great books
that have been written about this. The Al Gore book, ""Our Choice,"" and the David MacKay book,
""Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."" They really go through it
and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this. There's a lot that has to come together. So this is a wish. It's a very concrete wish
that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish
for the next 50 years -- I could pick who's president, I could pick a vaccine,
which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2
gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don't get this wish, the division between the people
who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the US and China,
between poor countries and rich, and most of all, the lives of those two billion
will be far worse. So what do we have to do? What am I appealing to you
to step forward and drive? We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together
in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2. They should discuss
this innovation agenda. You'd be stunned at the ridiculously
low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives --
CO2 tax, cap and trade -- something that gets
that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue
be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps
that the government takes. This is an important wish,
but it is one I think we can achieve. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause ends) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) CA: Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower. I mean, first of all, can you give a sense
of what scale of investment this is? Bill Gates: To actually do the software,
buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists,
which we've done, that's only tens of millions. And even once we test our materials out
in a Russian reactor to make sure our materials work properly, then you'll only be up
in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing
is building the pilot reactor -- finding the several billion,
finding the regulator, the location that will actually build
the first one of these. Once you get the first one built,
if it works as advertised, then it's just clear as day, because the economics,
the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it. CA: So to understand it right, this involves building
deep into the ground, almost like a vertical column
of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium, and then the process starts
at the top and kind of works down? BG: That's right. Today, you're always
refueling the reactor, so you have lots of people and lots
of controls that can go wrong, where you're opening it up
and moving things in and out -- that's not good. So if you have very -- (Laughter) very cheap fuel
that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have
those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns
for the 60 years, and then it's done. CA: It's a nuclear power plant
that is its own waste disposal solution. BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there -- there's a lot
less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that. And we start out, actually,
by taking the waste that exists today that's sitting in these cooling pools
or dry-casking by reactors -- that's our fuel to begin with. So the thing that's been a problem
from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you're reducing the volume
of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. CA: You're talking
to different people around the world about the possibilities. Where is there most interest
in actually doing something with this? BG: Well, we haven't picked
a particular place, and there's all these interesting
disclosure rules about anything that's called ""nuclear."" So we've got a lot of interest. People from the company
have been in Russia, India, China. I've been back seeing
the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits
into the energy agenda. So I'm optimistic. The French and Japanese
have done some work. This is a variant on something
that has been done. It's an important advance,
but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done
a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually
taking something like this live? BG: Well, we need -- for one of these
high-scale, electro-generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent
and then 20 years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models
have shown us that we have to meet. And TerraPower -- if things go well,
which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that. And there are, fortunately
now, dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot
plants goes well, that they can compete for this. And it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use
a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed. CA: In terms of big-scale
possible game changers, is this the biggest
that you're aware of out there? BG: An energy breakthrough
is the most important thing. It would have been, even
without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint
just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space,
there are other innovators. You know, we don't know their work
as well as we know this one, but the modular people,
that's a different approach. There's a liquid-type reactor,
which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. And so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this
is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy
as a molecule of, say, coal. And so, if you can
deal with the negatives, which are essentially the radiation,
the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect
on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own. CA: If this doesn't work, then what? Do we have to start taking
emergency measures to try and keep the temperature
of the earth stable? BG: If you get into that situation, it's like if you've been overeating,
and you're about to have a heart attack. Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research
on what's called geoengineering, which are various techniques
that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years
to get our act together. Now, that's just an insurance policy;
you hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even
work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you'll keep eating because you know
heart surgery will be there to save you. I'm not sure that's wise,
given the importance of the problem, but there's now
the geoengineering discussion about: Should that be in the back
pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes
a lot slower than we expect? CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two
to say to them, how might you persuade them
that they're wrong? BG: Well, unfortunately,
the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific
arguments are very few. Are they saying there's negative
feedback effects that have to do with clouds
that offset things? There are very, very few things
that they can even say there's a chance
in a million of those things. The main problem we have here --
it's kind of like with AIDS: you make the mistake now,
and you pay for it a lot later. And so, when you have
all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now
that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing. In fact, the IPCC report --
that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world
who look at IPCC and say, ""OK, that isn't that big of a deal."" The fact is it's that uncertain part
that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic,
and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, ""OK, I don't care
that it doesn't put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2. But I guess I'll accept it, because it's cheaper
than what's come before."" (Applause) CA: So that would be your response
to the Bjørn Lomborg argument, basically if you spend all this energy
trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away
all your other goals of trying to rid the world
of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste
of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. BG: Well, the actual
spending on the R&D piece -- say the US should spend 10 billion a year
more than it is right now -- it's not that dramatic. It shouldn't take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on,
and reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something
that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that -- that, to me, mostly is a waste. Unless you're very close, and you're just funding the learning curve
and it's going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential
to be far less expensive. If the trade-off you get into is,
""Let's make energy super expensive,"" then the rich can afford that. I mean, all of us here could pay
five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion. And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is, ""Why isn't the R&D
getting more discussed?"" He's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he's realized
that's a pretty lonely camp, and so, he's making the R&D point. And so there is a thread of something
that I think is appropriate. The R&D piece --
it's crazy how little it's funded. CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak
on behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. BG: Thank you. (Applause)"
S_zX9L8A2Hk,Kal Raustiala - South China Sea: Conflict Or Cooperation?,"For an area with the tiniest of populations, the South China Sea certainly gets a lot of attention from world leaders, military strategists, shippers, energy and fisheries planners, and the general public. A number of countries lay claim to islands and rocks in the 1.4 million square mile region. Much of the oil that powers the economies of China, Japan, and South Korea passes through the area. So does a huge share of global trade. China’s built air strips, the Philippines has gone to court, Vietnam and China have sparred over oil exploration, the United States has sailed ships and flown planes near the disputed islands and rocks, and last month, Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-jeou visited an island controlled by Taiwan’s military, but claimed by three other governments. The region deserves the attention its getting.

He’s published numerous articles in academic journals as well as in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, the New Yorker and other publications.",1,"what I really want to do is talk about the United States excuse me and our our interest in our role let me just mention one thing earlier this year I received a call from the philippine consulate here in Los Angeles this is in advance of the sunnylands summit that occurred the ASEAN summit and they said would we be interested would I be interested in hosting the president of the Philippines to talk about the West Philippine Sea and I said of course we'd be happy to host him and in the end we weren't able to work out a venue and so the event didn't happen but what was striking was how rarely you here West Philippine Sea you always hear South China Sea and of course some sunzu told us that the supreme art of war is to is to subdue the enemy without fighting and in terms of the nomenclature I think China has clearly succeeded in that we only ever talk about the South China Sea so what is the US interest in the South China Sea well the US has been a Pacific Power for at least a century dating back to the acquisition of the Philippines in the spanish-american war of course the Philippines were an American colony for many decades and also the acquisition of Hawaii the Republic of Hawaii at about the same time so roughly at the end of the 19th century the us both acquired Hawaii and then acquired the Philippines and in doing that for the first time in a meaningful way projected its power and its presence directly into the western Pacific and of course in the many decades the over century since the US has never really left and today the United States has a troop presence in East Asia as many of you know of upwards of 80,000 troops mostly concentrated in the north in Japan and to some degree in Korea where the seventh Fleet sits in Japan but spread out around so the US has always had a major military presence we have a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines dating back from 1951 and that was strengthened just a couple of years ago the relationship has been a little rocky but the philippines philippine government is much more interested in the united states and its military presence today than it used to be what other thing to note about the united states that's may be unique it is unique is the size of the US Navy so the US Navy is over 400 chips depending on how you count 10 to 12 aircraft carrier groups each group of course comprises a lot of ships so the US has a uniquely global Navy the reason I'm stressing that is because that explains a lot of what the US interest is in the South China Sea so first of all the United States government takes no position on the sovereignty claims that Professor foo laid out for us just a few moments ago there's no official u.s. position on who controls the islands professor who is absolutely right to stress that the basic principle of the law of the sea has always been the land controls the water that is absolutely correct so who controls the land is the critical issue there's no u.s. position on that there are many claimants I'm sure if we had others here we would hear differing stories and see different evidence but again there's no American position on that so the American position is really about regardless of who controls those land features and I'll just call them land features because they vary quite a bit regardless of who controls them what sorts of rights do others have in terms of transit and in terms of use of that water are we allowed for example to engage in innocent passage what kind of freedom of navigation does the US or really anybody else enjoy and so when I mentioned the size and presence of the u.s. Navy that is important because the US has had a program of freedom of navigation operations dating back to the Carter Administration to the late 1970s and there are many many many of these operations that occur we never hear about them most of them really are not interesting nothing happens some sort of warship transits through or passes by a particular land feature nothing really goes on what's unusual about what's occurred in the last six months and of course going back lady us some examples from an earlier time is the degree of tension and even conflict that's occurred around them so I just want to stress that what the US has done in the South China Sea what the US Navy has done is not unusual for the US Navy and in that sense is not also aimed at China because remember that there are many claimants to these to these features Taiwan of course claims exactly the same set of positions that we've just heard laid out by Professor food you'll hear exactly the same thing if we had the effective consul general here from Taipei of course the Vietnamese the Philippines etc all have similar times so so this isn't named a China per se but of course we know geopolitically the relationship between the US and China is the one that matters a couple of other points I want to make one thing that's often pointed out when it comes to what is the u.s. position visa V the South China Sea is why is the US not a party to the UN Convention on the law of the sea one Clause professor foo laid out a few of the most significant principles for this particular case so what does it mean that the u.s. is not a party first of all why are we not a party and the second what does is what's a significance of that so in terms of the why question I'll just say that it's a quirky product of American politics and doesn't represent the position of either the US Navy which has always been strongly supportive of the law of the sea treaty and in fact has consistently argued that the United States should be a party to it nor is it a position of the executive branch so go back to the Clinton administration the Bush administration the Obama administration in all of those cases there was support for the United States to sign the UN Convention on the law of the sea the reason it hasn't happened is because within the US Senate of course the US Senate has to consent to any such treaty by two-thirds majority then the US Senate there are senators who I think for for unfounded reasons view the law of the sea convention as a threat to American sovereignty and in particular are concerned about some issues that probably are not foremost in the South China Sea but do you have some residents so for example the law of the sea treaty talks about the undersea mining that might occur and creates a kind of authority what's called the seabed Authority to deal with the resources that would come from deep sea bed mining and in the eyes of these senators this is another exam of a kind of centralized UN bureaucracy that will take resources and redistribute them and so for a host of reasons they have resisted the law of the sea treaty even though those those particular provisions are relatively I was a meaningless but they're not really the essential provisions certainly for sale trying to see they're not there number one there is some importance to them but there are some other issues that are even more important so conservatives for example in the u.s. like to call instead of own cloths they call it lost the law of the sea treaty that's their preferred shorthand for it and so they consider they continue to resist it and there's really no prospect at the moment that the US will sign it so that's simply a political fact now what significance flows from that does it matter that the u.s. is not a party for the most part the answer is no it doesn't matter and the reason it doesn't matter is the law of the sea convention is a treaty that codifies pre-existing law there are many such treaties during the 60s and 70s and 80s when when unclass was negotiated and signed it was finalized in 1982 it was one of many such treaties that aimed at codifying areas of international law that had been traditionally understood as customary international law customary international law refers to the kind of international law that states develop through their practices visa vie one another not by writing them down in a sense like common law in the u.s. system or in the anglo-american system and of course issues around the high seas go back centuries so this is a paradigmatic example of customary international law so while the law of the sea treaty does maybe clarify certain areas of the law it does create some dispute settlement provisions that only apply to parties for the most part it simply takes pre-existing law and codifies that law and so in practice the US Navy treats the law of the sea treaty as binding on itself in the sense of the substantive rules that it contains so it's not a it's not a significant issue in terms of the actual practice and in terms of legal arguments that go back and forth between the US and many other countries we invoke the same kinds of principles and often the same provisions that Professor food mentioned so let me say a word or two about the u.s. actions so the USS lassen for example earlier this fall the Curtis Wilbur in January what how should we view these actions in which warships were sent through deliberately sent through the South China Sea and of course within close proximity to certain of these features and I'm calling them features because there's a factual dispute of course about whether there are islands or not it will return to that in a moment so first of all under the Convention on the law of the sea and under traditional customary principles warships are always permitted to engage in innocent passage meaning they can pass through even a territorial sea the closest part of the sea as long as they abide by certain rules so they can't threaten or use force they can't spy they can't engage in war games and so forth if it's literally just an innocent passage that's okay and it always has been in my view the US Navy has adhered to those rules the ships that have been sent the ones I mentioned did not fire weapons did not threaten to use force did not engage in war games we're not spying so in all senses they were operated consistent with the principles of the law of the sea so I don't think there's really a legal dispute over that now that said if we step back and look at the politics of this especially in the us-china relationship we of course have to recognize that china is in a unusual position in that as I mentioned the beginning of my talk there are over 70,000 over 80,000 depending on how you count american troops in east asia and a network of bases and treaty alliances that could be viewed as encircling china so if we were to flip this around and say what would it be like if the chinese instead operated a series of bases off of baja california in which they put one of their major fleets and had a huge troop presence how would we feel here in the United States and I think there would be quite a bit of discomfort with that and of course if Chinese warships were frequently transiting off the coast of California going back and forth we might be a little troubled by that so I think of course in context we have to recognize that the US and China are not similarly situated we may be a Pacific Power in the United States but we don't live in Asia China of course has always lived in Asia has in many ways to find Asia so we have to be cognizant of that perception when the United States engages in these operations that's it I think it's important you know what argument that flows from that that one sometimes hears is that the US should be much more sensitive to China and really should not be pushing the issue by engaging in these freedom of navigation operations I tend to think the opposite is true i think when when there are claims made that are overly strong and overly broad that's precisely when you need to establish the principle of freedom of navigation and all the subsidiary principles that flow so in that sense I'm supportive but it has to be done delicately and carefully I want to close by making two points so the very end I just want to respond to a couple of things professor Liu said I think the major point I want to make is that going forward the South China Sea is incredibly significant economically and militarily clay at the beginning laid out all the reasons why but it's also significant as a test case and it's a test case for the relationship between the US and China and between China and the rest of Asia and in that sense it's a test case about a rules-based order what kind of international order do we have and will it be one that is rules based in which we have agreed-upon rules and principles and systems of adjudication and negotiation to address disputes within them or do we have a system that's more predicated on power coercion and military might of course it's in all of our interests to have the former and not the latter as we pointed out in the very beginning world war two was incredibly destructive in China more so than here in Asia more so than North America no one wants to see anything remotely like that so it's imperative that we operate carefully and think about how we might bolster a rules-based order and that's why the arbitration that was mentioned by Professor foo is so important because the arbitration again the u.s. does not have a position on and I'm not speaking on behalf of the US government of course but the u.s. does not have a position directly in that except I think to the degree and here again is not an official line that arbitration and rule of law processes for disputes are generally favored we would like to see that process go forward China of course has a different view in this particular case but has often stated that it wants to support a rules-based order and will build one as much as possible so I think over the next year or two we will see how that plays out and that will be extremely important regardless of the outcome in the specific disputes at stake in that arbitration last thing about the substantive claims I really haven't said anything about the legal claims that China has laid out in part because professor fruit laid them out so well and in part because there were so many other things to discuss but I just want to say that at bottom I agree with Professor food that there is not clear guidance within own claws on the features and the claim that China makes with the nine-dash line what Professor foo has laid out the evidence that he laid out for us today historical evidence some was very interesting I've never seen before is important and in on cloths there is discussion about course historical title and the idea that history matters who possesses lie on matters the land in turn gives you control over the sea that said these are questions of fact and so at bottom this is not about lawyers arguing over what April provision and the very long is over well over 100 provisions in the law of the sea what a particular provision might say or how it should be interpreted but really about a question of historical fact did China control these islands did other states in the region or parties in the region except chinese control those are factual questions and I would submit that the best way to get to the bottom of factual questions is in a proceeding in which those can be unearthed and pitted against opposing forms of evidence in other words in some kind of legal process so I guess the only area where I might differ and I don't know that Professor we necessarily took this position is that I think China should embrace if it's comfortable in its position it should embrace processes like the arbitration and any future such dispute settlement procedures if it feels it has the best argument it should put those arguments up against opposing arguments that we should work this out in a rule-based fashion so let me close with that I look forward to hearing from the other presenters and I want to thank clay for having me here thank you"
GyVqX2dOT8w,Shelley Rigger on Taiwan's Role in China's Economic Rise,"How did the once-secretive, isolated People’s Republic of China become the factory to the world? Shelley Rigger argues the answer is Taiwan. In The Tiger Leading the Dragon, she follows the evolution of Taiwan’s influence from the period when Deng Xiaoping lifted Mao’s prohibitions on business in the late 1970s, allowing investors from Taiwan to collaborate with local officials in the PRC to transform mainland China into a manufacturing powerhouse. After World War II, Taiwan’s fleet-footed export-oriented manufacturing firms became essential links in global supply chains. In the late 1980s, Taiwanese firms seized the opportunity to lower production costs by moving to the PRC, which was seeking foreign investment to fuel its industrial rise. Within a few years, Taiwan’s traditional manufacturing had largely relocated to the PRC, opening space for a wave of new business creation in information technology. The Tiger Leading the Dragon traces the development of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic relationship and explores how Taiwanese firms and individuals transformed Chinese business practices. Rigger’s book also reveals Taiwanese contributions to Chinese consumer behavior, philanthropy, religion, popular culture, and law.

Shelley Rigger is Brown Professor of political science at Davidson College. She frequently writes for think tanks (e.g., Brookings Institution) and speaks to Congressional panels (e.g., Dec. 2020) and military workshops. Her books include Why Taiwan Matters: Small Island, Global Powerhouse (which she shared at USC) on Taiwan’s place in the world and two volumes on Taiwan's domestic politics, Politics in Taiwan: Voting for Democracy and From Opposition to Power: Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party. Prof. Rigger was based in Taiwan as a Fulbright Senior Scholar in 2019-2020. She joined our 2020 election roundtable.

See Shelley Rigger in our 2020 Taiwan election roundtable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6c0ogUMHOo",1,we're focusing on taiwan and we're looking at what professor shelley rigger has uh written a book about how taiwan was involved in helping to bring china the people's republic of china to the position that it now occupies with the world's second largest economy uh rapidly growing challenging the us in uh technology challenging the world with its technological innovations in this way few people are as well equipped well prepared to talk about this as professor rigger she has written here a great work of history it's full of political analysis and it's also an economic primer on east asia's development you can get so much for the from this book it draws on her research on both sides of the taiwan strait and it begins with a puzzle and so that's where she'll start professor rigger is the brown professor of political science at davidson college a school in north carolina a highly selective uh institution she's a graduate of princeton and harvard she's done really quite a lot in a relatively brief career she started by focusing on islam in china but shifted gears focused on taiwan looked at taiwan's democratization its economic development and of course taiwan's relationship with its giant neighbor and its relationship with the world we have been really fortunate to have her with us on a couple of occasions she introduced her 2011 book and you can watch the video from that a little bit later not right now that book is why taiwan matters small island global powerhouse and it's a really important contribution to our understanding about taiwan and its place in the world but she's written many other studies about taiwan she may have been one of the first uh writing in english to focus on generational change and what that might mean in taiwan so take a look at her several books she is a distinguished scholar an accomplished educator and an important public intellectual she's somebody who speaks to congress she participates in the training of military officers and we have her with us today so friends we are really happy that you are with us to hear from professor shelley rigger talking about the dr the tiger leading the dragon we want you to be part of this conversation too so take advantage of that q a function on your zoom screen go to the bottom of that zoom screen click on that q a button to share with us your question we'll put links to professor riggers books and things like that in the chat but please to get to us post your question in the q and a section so without further ado let's turn to professor shelley rigger shelley thank you for joining us today well it is so much my pleasure to be with you so i'm gonna go ahead and share my introduction of this new book the tiger leading the dragon how taiwan propelled china's economic rise let's see so we all remember this kind of image right the the spectacular transformation of shanghai from 1980 to 2006 and actually that particular stretch of road probably looks fairly similar now in 2021 but just the uh incredible transformation of china in a very short period of time from a primarily agricultural and very poorly resourced and isolated country and economy to this bustling central feature of the global economy and really even by 2006 already well on its way to becoming the factory to the world and one of the ways that we can also uh you know visualize some people like to look at the pictures and visualize it that way other people want to look at a graph and visualize it this way but you know this just shows us the magnitude of china's transformation specifically measured by its its exports so its contribution to the global economy and of course a major inflection point for china economically was joining the wto um at the end of 2000 early 2001 when you see this incredible acceleration in china's export growth but that this graph the the scale of the y-axis disguises something that i think is actually really important and that's this trajectory so even before joining the wto china's econo china's export growth was really impressive and while it did accelerate even faster in subsequent years even 1978 to 2000 tells a pretty interesting story so just as 2001 is an inflection point with the wto we're left with this question even before 2001 how did the prc this country that had no private property as of 1976 no business in the sense in which we understand business in the west how did the prc become the factory to the world by the mid to late 2000s and you know the wto is part of it but here's another part of it in 1987 the for the first time taiwanese were allowed to travel to the prc and almost immediately traveling to the prc they recognized the economic opportunities that the prc's reform and opening which began in 1978 offered to them and so i would say that if 2001 is an inflection point 1987 is also won and while you know it may take a little time for these trends to really be reflected in the data by 1993 there's already a significant upward spike in china's exports so my answer the answer that i am going to defend perhaps put forward tonight to how the prc became the factory to the world is that a very significant factor in that transformation was foreign direct investment and specifically manufacturing oriented and export-oriented manufacturing oriented investment largely by ethnic chinese from overseas hong kong investors played a really important role but i think there is a uniquely significant contribution that we haven't really talked about enough from taiwanese investors or the people who are called in china taishong here they are actually these are not taishong these are people who play tai shang on tv because by 2012 the phenomenon of taiwanese investors taiwanese business people being in the mainland doing business was such a a big deal and something that was so intriguing and fascinating to uh prc citizens that there's actually this television show a kind of um business soap opera called taishan so taiwanese have changed the prc in many ways the contributions that they have made have had an enormous influence on the prc economy you know foxconn it's just too easy i gotta find another photograph because everybody knows foxconn but there are literally thousands of companies obviously none of them on the scale of foxconn but thousands of companies taiwanese companies that have had a really profound effect on different prc communities but it's not only the economy that has been affected by the introduction of taiwanese influences into the prc i also in the book talk about and tonight i want to just give you a little bit of a taste of the ways in which taiwanese investors students dependents workers have affected the culture and lifestyles in the prc as well so how have they done this well by bringing taiwan's experience of export-oriented manufacturing development to the mainland so in toy story buzz lightyear remember um you guys are in southern california so you you all are buzz lightyear fans i'm sure buzz lightyear thinks that he's a real guy like a real spaceman but he's actually a plastic toy and how does he find out how does he make this shocking discovery about himself he finds inside of his glove the words made in taiwan and then he knows oh my gosh i really am just a plastic toy so the joke there of course is that for people of a certain age my age uh growing up things like plastic toys small electronics like the transistor radios that uh everybody put under their pillows so we could listen to baseball games and music at night after we were supposed to be lights out uh all that kind of stuff came with made in taiwan stamped on it somewhere but of course today all of that stuff even literally your buzz lightyear's toy is made in china and i think there's a really important story to be told here which is how taiwanese manufacturers who were making this kind of item [Music] right up until the late 1980s transferred that manufacturing process that the the specific manufacturing of of actual stuff but also all of the things that go along with that kind of export-oriented manufacturing to the prc so in order to really make sense of this story i need to tell you a little something about how taiwan became the place where plastic toys and electronic small electronics and so on were manufactured and it really begins in the japanese colonial period so 1895 to 1945 when japan was part of or taiwan was part of the empire of japan there was already even then an effort to upgrade taiwan's infrastructure for some basic manufacturing or basic industrial tasks mainly agricultural processing so this is a sugar mill back in the day then after taiwan became detached from the japanese empire and was handed over to the republic of china so the uh government as of the end of world war ii that was in power throughout mainland china which soon thereafter lost mainland china to the communist party but shortly after that transfer of power from the japanese empire to this chinese-led leadership taiwan underwent a very important agricultural revolution which was rooted in uh a land reform a land to the tiller land reform that greatly accelerated taiwan's capital accumulation so you had small family businesses that were originally farms but as people began to accumulate crack capital through this uh um sharp increase in productivity thanks to the land reform they began to create small and medium-sized enterprises for manufacturing so in the 1950s 60s 70s taiwan became this island of tiny workshops where all kinds of products were made for export under other brands so taiwan did not develop very many of its own brands but what taiwan had a lot of was contract manufacturing for exports so this is a bicycle factory um and it's it kind of looks like any taiwanese factory in the 1980s or even this one's probably from the early 90s small scale out in the countryside pretty low technology and the boss is on the factory floor doing the work alongside the employees in 1987 president jiang jinguo decided to allow taiwanese who had been prevented from traveling to the mainland since the uh basically since the end of the chinese civil war in the 1940s he decided to let taiwanese go back to the mainland to see the people that they had left behind during this and after the civil war well a lot of those guys were very elderly who went in 1987 and they took with them their sons their sons-in-law to carry the luggage and the sons and sons-in-law saw in the prc an incredible opportunity to and to reinvigorate the kinds of businesses that by the late 1980s in taiwan were starting to run out of room because of the rising cost of production so taiwan was becoming a more developed place wages were rising expectations for things like environmental regulation were increasing and it was just getting really hard to be competitive in that kind of injection-molded plastic world so immediately in 1987 you see taiwanese entrepreneurs the owners of these small and medium-sized contract manufacturing export oriented businesses going to the mainland and setting up shop and radically reducing their costs so that they could continue to service the same clients so continue to manufacture for the same branded companies but at a much lower price so early on everybody was scared to death in taiwan you know oh my gosh we're hollowing out our economy all of our manufacturing is going to the mainland what's going to happen to taiwan so there's one more step in the taiwan story that we have to pay attention to before i start talking really about what happened in the mainland and that is the fact that taiwan's economy kind of did empty out a little bit actually created demand and space for another huge and far more high value sector to develop and that is the high-tech ict and semiconductor industries and many many many of the companies that we know that are household names today acer asus tsmc are products of this ecosystem that the taiwanese government promoted through organizations led by the industrial technology research institute for itri uh in taiwan okay so all these guys go over to mainland china and what do they do well they do the same thing they did in taiwan if this photo looks a lot like the one of the uh welding line in the bicycle factory um it's because it was the same kind of business model in the prc that these manufacturers were using back in taiwan so this is actually a photo that my host clayton dube gave me that he took back in 1991 on the outskirts of shanghai where a taiwanese manufacturer who's making pool toys has set up manufacturing in the mainland and they're making the same thing no doubt for the same exact clients but at a much lower cost because now they're paying the land cost the labor cost the water and electricity cost of china in the 1990s mainland china in the 1990s rather than taiwan where all of those costs were way higher so the result of this movement of taiwanese investors taking their businesses to the mainland was just an explosion in cross-strait trade from uh 5 dollars in 1998 to 150 billion in 2018 and also an explosion in taiwanese investment in the prc and both of these figures are using taiwanese government statistics so they're actually probably underestimates so the taishong these taiwanese businessmen contributed to the prc economy in many ways and i'm going to talk about money jobs technology management expertise and supply chain relationships but i'm going to tell you right up front i think the most valuable of all was the supply chain relationships that it would have been extremely difficult for prc entities to develop manufacturing capacity that would have allowed them to enter global supply chains without the being introduced into those supply chains by people who were or companies that were already embedded in them that is these taiwanese companies so money wise we know that between 91 and 2 and 2020 there was at least 188 billion dollars invested from taiwan into the prc but actually it's probably two or three times that amount because much of this investment especially in the early years but even right up to the present is channeled through third parties so it's not directly from taiwan to the mainland but works its way through hong kong um the british virgin islands panama cayman islands um so the while no one really knows for sure exactly how much has been invested by taiwanese people and entities in the prc uh i think most of the most expert economists agree that taiwan is china's second largest investor talking about jobs uh there are many millions of again nobody knows and when i asked this question so i used to ask this question when i went to see tai chang in the mainland and they were like that one we're not answering because they pay taxes per head so the size of their workforce is the size of their tax burden and they have a number that they give the tax authorities and that is their number but they were not interested in giving me a number that might not be exactly the same so nobody really knows how many times uh how many people are employed by taiwanese investors either but we know that it is a very large number and it's larger the effects are maybe disproportionate to the absolute numbers because they're so concentrated so most taiwanese companies are concentrated in a relatively limited number of localities so places like dongguan and quinchon have massive amounts of taiwanese investment xiamen a few other places and then many parts of china have very limited taiwanese investment although as costs in the coastal regions have risen some of the taiwanese investors have gone inland to look for a better environment and there's some interesting stuff in the book that i don't have time to talk about tonight about some of the challenges that come with trying to export this model which is based on migrant labor that is disciplined by the prc state and made available at a low cost to investors taiwanese prc other foreign not all of those are available in the inland regions taiwanese investors also brought enormous amounts of technological innovation to the prc right uh the prc had heavy industry in the mao era but it was very limited in light and consumer industry which is exactly what global markets want from a low cost platform so the technology for that kind of manufacturing also needed to come from taiwan and then management expertise so how do you actually organize production for these international clients so i chose this photo or this image of la puda the castle in the sky from a hayao miyazaki movie to um sort of represent the concept that my good friend the sociologist uh chun ming chi developed the fortress in the air he said these taiwanese communities and networks uh and clusters of businesses that are all working together to produce a particular item for a particular customer they're enclosed they're self-reliant they really try to minimize their attachment to the prc community in which they are located so taiwanese businesses whole supply chains moved on mass to the mainland and continued the same kind of production process that they had mastered back in taiwan and then finally supply chain relationships so it's really difficult to manufacture for nike nike has a lot of internal intellectual property that they need you to protect they have incredibly high quality expectations they want the contracting relationship to be smooth they want to be able to tell their customers that they're not using sweatshop labor and they're constantly updating their designs so not just anybody can can manufacture for nike so what you see is the big global brands like nike adidas puma timberland that's just shoes or all kinds of electronic devices like apple products and high-end manufacturing and schwinn was ultimately kind of pushed aside by taiwanese bicycle brands but all of these companies yayan foxconn giant were taiwanese companies that already were manufacturing for these brands in taiwan so when they went to the mainland and started manufacturing for those same brands it was a smooth transition for the customer for the for nike for for schwinn and it was a smooth transition for the taiwanese manufacturer but what they discovered is that in the mainland the labor supply the availability of land and other resources made it possible for them to become much larger than they ever could have been if they had stayed in taiwan and so what did the taishan these taiwanese businesses get out of taking their operations to the mainland a new lease on life right they were about to be squeezed out by lower cost manufacturing platforms as the cost of production in taiwan got too high but by moving to the mainland they're able to bring their costs back down and start over on a much bigger platform but i want to just conclude by saying something about ways in which taiwanese have influenced the prc that go beyond just the business part of the picture consumer taste uh new consumer taste being being imported into mainland china the introduction of philanthropy and forms of philanthropy that had not existed the rejuvenation of of religion traditional chinese religion the um enlivening of popular culture in the prc and also and i won't talk about this one tonight but a lot of prc institutions are also heavily influenced by taiwan especially legal institutions so the big um benefit to the prc of having taiwanese in the retail sector is affordable luxury so you know a lot of a lot of people in the prc can afford real luxury so they can afford gucci prada uh starbucks but a lot of people in the prc want to have a kind of elegant and beautiful high-class experience but they can't afford gucci prada they can't afford starbucks and taiwan's special niche is to be able to marry chinese taste and price point to the feeling of a special experience and in fact taiwan has come to be kind of associated in the prc with that more high class or deluxe experience so wedding photography is an entire industry that came from taiwan to the prc but even this contemporary ad for the lilly garden wedding photography shop says and the dresses are imported from taiwan so you know this is 2021 and we're still wanting uh a dress that feels special and it feels special because it's imported from taiwan or yes for those of you who read chinese korea is also one of the one of the high class points of origin for wedding gowns also philanthropy so uh the tsuji buddhist compassion relief association was the first overseas ngo to be able to operate in china and mainly excuse me in mainland china and it is to this day one of the only foreign or non-prc based organizations that is allowed to provide direct services to um prc people in need also religion uh these religious pilgrimages from taiwan into the prc reintroduced religious practices and rituals that had been dormant during the period of high maoism so the cultural revolution a lot of people in the prc kind of wanted to do religious practices but those religious practices were hard to recover and taiwanese went to the mainland they paid for the renovation of temples and they built new temples so this is a um a temple built by the folguangshan religious organization in taiwan bringing the opportunity for traditional chinese religious practice to reawaken in the prc and pop culture you know from theresa dung who they used to say back in the deng xiaoping era uh big dung rules during the day that's done shopping uh but little dung rules in the evening that's teresa dung the uh sweet voiced crooner who uh took who brought love and romance back to prc popular culture after the cultural revolution other superstars ame the very popular taiwanese singer who is still performing in throughout the region and in the prc and someone like jay cho super popular singer even the language as it is spoken in the prc has been influenced by these cross currents and hybridization with taiwan so the idea uh that tongue the mainland word that was introduced to capture the idea of comrades so in the prc you know communism you need a term that means comrades that you use as a term of address well comrades in hong kong and then popularized in taiwan in mandarin came to be a kind of ironic way of saying lgbtq now in taiwan everybody knows tong jer means gay but they also know that in the prc that beijing lgbt center is the beijing tundra so there is another chapter and i'm not really going to talk about this tonight because i want to get to your questions but uh this is a story that's kind of coming to an end now it is uh increasingly the case that the costs in ch in the mainland are rising to the point where a lot of taiwanese manufacturers can no longer make a profit in the prc and they are looking further afield for opportunities and it is also true that many many many prc companies have found their way into global supply chains and are either operating alongside taiwanese companies or are displacing taiwanese companies within those supply chains so the role of taiwanese entrepreneurs is not so critical in the prc anymore although they still have a lot of business there and they still do a lot of business there but there is now something called the red supply chain so the indigenous prc supply chain that has to some extent um replaced or kind of overtaken taiwanese investors in the mainland and i think i'm gonna call it there and look forward to discussing all of these ideas with you thank you so much for that whirlwind trip through taiwan's economic development and the link between taiwan and the chinese mainland this economic link that has had all of these other influences right in society and culture and that sort of thing i have a couple of questions that i'd like to get to including some things that you didn't address tonight but that you talk about at some length in the book that i think are really useful for people to be aware of but we are also receiving questions from the audience and some of those uh audience members we have a large audience and some of them you actually cite in this book okay so we have people from academia and we also have some tai chang uh some taiwanese business people who are joining us so we'd like to like to get to some of their questions as well but let me back up you know back to the 1970s and you know the early 1980s because one of the interesting things that you highlight uh is of course the enticements the efforts that the mainland made to entice outside investors uh to bring in uh external technology these kinds of things and one of the names that many people not may are certainly familiar with but may not associate with that is joe and lie and you highlight joe and lie with the idea of special economic zones which deng xiaoping will later come to power and put into place but you also identify some of the key technocrats on the taiwan side that helped push taiwan's economy forward could you take a moment and we'll we'll talk about more recent leaders in just a minute but can you take a moment but uh to discuss the role of early leadership on both sides of the strait sure you know part of why i wanted to do this book is that i'm really interested in the east asian developmental state and i have been ever since i read a magnificent book looking at the sun by james fallows which just really explain how japan could have become you know the japan that that we know today but that we we were really scared of back in the mid 1980s through this kind of collaboration between business and private ownership and government leadership and the what what in japan they called administrative guidance and both japan and south korea use that developmental state apparatus to develop really large companies and to develop global brands so everybody knows lots of you know japanese brand names lots everybody knows lots of korean brand names but most people don't know or they didn't know until tsmc suddenly had a chip shortage and they were on the on the news every day you know a lot of people don't really know taiwanese brands so one of the things that's interesting about taiwan is that the the form that the developmental state took there was a bit different and it focused more on enabling bottom up entrepreneurship than on sort of picking winners and constructing big companies that were going to be able to be dominant in their sectors so there's a lot more failure in taiwan than maybe in japan and korea no taiwanese are so tough and this generation that became the taishan and went to the mainland we're so used to starting a business and having it fail there's this whole story um in the book of the uh swarm of bees so there are all kinds of wonderful uh chinese expressions for stuff that economists have a fancy name for but i don't know what you call swarm of bees but that's when uh everybody finds out oh my gosh uh barbie i'm gonna make i'm gonna do in injection molded plastics because i'm going to be a mattel supplier make make a barbie and everybody goes in and they're swarming all over it and nobody makes a profit you know uh these taiwanese businessmen were not protected by the state they were they were and are genuine entrepreneurs so when they get into and there's people like kt lee the you know who basically guided the taiwanese economy from the 1940s right up until the end of his life in the 90s they were they understood the virtues of of the private but they also understood the necessity for the state to enable and to create an environment in which private business could really thrive and i think what you see in the prc then at the the in the early dungeon era is sort of trying to figure out can we do this so tves are an attempt to kind of blur the line between public and private but tvs have these limitations that have to do with capital and markets and technology there's like lots of reasons why tves couldn't take off but i think a big reason that tves couldn't take off was that they didn't have a market you know their they needed an they needed an external market in order to develop china's internal consumption power to the point where it could be sort of self-propelling one might argue we're still in that stage today right there are people who would say you know what china needs is a higher income society so they can buy up the stuff that they're making but anyway that's where the seds come in because the secs are like a way of walling off private capital from chinese society to see how it goes like can these foreign investors really make money for us can they create employment for us well while we're finding out the answer to that we're going to keep them in a in a corral but they were so successful and the secs were so powerful as a driver of growth that local governments in the adjacent you know like so fujian guangdong everybody on the outskirts of the sec is like we need a piece of this action no that you tell that so well here but also in the book describing that and how the success of this of course encourages uh beijing to expand these kinds of opportunities and to do these uh to make it possible for not just taiwanese but especially taiwanese to come in and do these kinds of things one of the things that comes through in the book is the transfer of techniques and networks that had had worked for taiwanese business people in taiwan and then they bring that over some of that same sort of thing and you refer to clustering you talk about networks perhaps the credit aspect is not so important by the time they get to the mainland they have plenty of capital but maybe you could say something more about how that works and how that is part of the supply chain strength that taiwan brings yeah one of the things that i really loved researching this book was uh learning about how taiwanese business families operate and so you know some of these are generalizations like definitely not every taiwanese company is the same but a lot of the smes are they're family businesses they start out really small and so dad the patriarch um makes something and one of the examples i use in the book is the umbrella king so the umbrella king makes them makes umbrellas and he figures out how to make umbrellas and then as his umbrella business grows and grows he branches into the component parts of umbrella making so making the spines you know the metal things that pop out making stretching aluminum tubing for the handles and each of his sons gets one of those kind of component businesses so they've got this kind of network dad's in charge and he's kind of controlling how they spin stuff off but they're also all working together and if somebody needs money to you know invest in something really expensive they all pull their resources and they so they're all kind of growing together but if something doesn't work you know you can triage it you can just cut it off throw it away and start something else and so many of these businesses are like that and so the patriarch holds it all together until he's gone and then they don't have to fight over who's going to be the ceo they're all the ceo of their own thing my total favorite chinese saying is it's better to be a chicken's head than a cow's ass which is you know like be in charge of something however small it is it's better to be the boss than to be at the bottom and i think that's why the high-tech revolution has been so hard for many people in taiwan is that you you can't run it that way you know uh a a tech company has to be sort of bureaucratized you know it's got an engineering function and it's hard i think for a lot of these kind of what they call uh black hand bosses that is guys who actually learned the business by doing the manufacturing process with their own hands it can be hard for them to uh trust this other kind of organization with their money yeah that comes through uh very much in the in the book talking about about this sort of thing but those networks would exist beyond the family beyond the family connections and you build these kinds of things and that adds a certain resilience a certain flexibility and agility that that you highlight if i could for a moment ask you to talk a little bit about the relationship between these business people the the folks who've created these business then they've brought it to brought it to the to the main to the mainland and in some cases they brought their managers as well that sort of thing but over time those folks get replaced uh in part it's a deliberate strategy to build up develop talent and in part it's just a necessity since your employees are all from whatever place be it shaman don't go on wherever it might might be can you say something about that relationship and the learning that happened as part of you know this business enterprise yeah so uh a lot of a lot of taiwanese business owners initially really wanted taiwanese right they wanted their white collar staff also to be from taiwan but it got really expensive in addition to the variables that you're mentioning it's also just really expensive you know they they want a premium over their salary in taiwan even though margins are lower in the mainland so i think for various reasons also the necessity to cultivate relationships with local officials which are a hugely important part of this whole story it was necessary to bring a prc citizens into uh business and that can be really dangerous because they can sometimes replicate what you're doing and because they are local their relationships are better and you know you find yourself kind of undercut and there are lots of just as there were lots of taiwanese businesses that failed in taiwan during the era of you know sme explosion there are lots of businesses that have failed in the mainland too and there are whole organizations devoted to kind of telling people don't go over there it's not safe you know they'll take your business they'll take your technology they'll take you know out whatever um but i think on the whole taiwanese have have accumulated a just massive amount of money it's hard to imagine how much wealth has been generated through this collaboration and one of the consequences one of the benefits to people in the prc is the opportunity to work in these organizations and to become leaders and to create their own businesses not necessarily in the same sector or niche but to be able to have the skills and the connections to be able to manufacture for international clients that's that really is evident and in some cases competitors in some cases these folks might become suppliers all sorts of all sorts of possibilities now i in just a moment we're going to shift uh to today and will shift also to tomorrow a lot of the questions that people have been asking have been speculative ones asking about what if but uh one more question here focusing on again leadership because one of the things that comes through through your book is that although we associate warming relations between taiwan and the mainland with the mayan joe years in fact you highlight all these things that uh really develop under censure bien the democratic progressive party leader who preceded ma and so i was wondering if you could say a little bit about that because the legacy of both you know chun's efforts uh to create some sort of what he considered to be a normal relationship that would involve trade would involve uh you know tourism these kinds of things and then the more explicit efforts that mind joe made to put in place you know treaty's legal agreements that would provide some protection for some of the business practices some means of adjudicating disputes those sorts of things so if you could say something about you know those first those first 16 years of the 21st century uh with those two administrations yeah one of the great ironies of this whole story is that uh taiwanese business in the mainland has flourished when it has been unregulated and no one was in charge you know it's it's really the collaboration is the product of local officials in the prc who wanted to do something for their communities and you know some people would say well they also wanted to do something for themselves and of course they did but they were bringing wealth to poor people who had no opportunities who had very limited opportunities and they created opportunities for them so they really wanted to grow their local economies and this was how they could do it and they did it so they were you know they were doing that uh the mountains are high the emperor's far away kind of thing too but the taiwanese businesses were oh we have no protection at all this is the wild west they relied on each other so there's also a lot in the book about the taiwanese business associations which kind of banded together to help uh taishan navigate challenges and catastrophes in the mainland but the more regulation and the more sort of institutionalized the interactions became in some ways the the more halting and difficult further you know further progress was and i i don't think it's really the fault of the ma administration you know but i think what the mind my administration was doing was first of all they were they were trying to make this happen with a new kind of industry that is just very different from uh you know light manufacturing for export but also they were trying to negotiate a two-way straight right up until 2012 it was a one-way straight and ma wanted to institutionalize a uh a more symmetrical relationship and that symmetrical relationship scared the living daylights out of a lot of people in taiwan and i didn't see it coming i don't think anybody really understood what the effect of having the money and the people coming the other way was going to be on taiwanese sentiment but i think a big part of how things kind of went off the rails between 2012 and 2014 was just the kind of in the book i talk about the increase in the number of prc tourists in taiwan from zero to like four million in five years time so that you know that was scary and as you say when it's profits flowing back uh you know you know to uh to taiwan that's one thing but now you have tourists and that is generating income for some businesses and those sorts of things but as you highlight in the book uh inequality expands in taiwan during this period it also grows on the mainland and it certainly grows in the united states at the same time but that that is one of the factors that leads to the sunflower movement the occupation of the legislative u.n and all of those sorts of things this is really one of the truly interesting parts of the book together with all of the cultural impact uh you gave us a couple of slides here but there are you know full chapters devoted to 85 degrees and you know the wedding photo industry and a whole lot more uh in the question of affordable luxury how can i how can i deliver you know five-star a five-star experience at a two-star price those kinds of discussions uh are covered at some length in in the book but i need to bring in some of the questions that have been raised here uh so before i do that a reminder everybody should be getting this book there's so much we don't we simply don't have time to explore all of it it's an incredibly rich and uh powerful story these individual examples of entrepreneurs of officials and a whole lot more but we have some concrete questions and so first uh one of the things that some uh foreign businesses have complained about is the difficulty of getting money out of china uh they have uh success making it but repay or i shouldn't say repatriating it but bringing it to wherever they want to bring it is a problem could you say something about uh the experience of the taiwanese business people yes it's a problem for them too and it has been for a long time um so they one of the reasons maybe why there is so much taiwanese investment is that it's easier to reinvest in in the mainland than to try and find a way to get your money out but it's also true that a lot of money does find its way out um and that's you know that leads to the problem of inequality and so on but yes that is they don't have the they don't have a secret formula or a special deal that makes it easy for them to get their money out okay so some of the same issues that confront uh businesses from outside the mainland confront uh these taiwanese taiwanese businesses as well one of the questions that we've uh that we've got uh concerns the belton road and whether or not uh taiwanese companies are playing a part in that uh you know i have anecdotal uh experience with this but maybe you might say something more about the ability of taiwanese companies to take advantage of these big initiatives in your book you highlight you know the the five-year plans made in china 2025 plan that sort of thing is there space on the belton road for some of these taiwanese companies um i would be very interested to hear you know your anecdotal um stories on that because you know my first thought is no for two reasons one is that the prc is not going to be um welcoming that kind of um uh contractor actually the prc doesn't even really welcome contractors from the country where they're building the thing much less you know um taiwanese contractors um and then number two is that you know taiwan is not that big in infrastructure um they for example taiwan has a huge alternative energy commitment and a lot of it is um foreign companies doing that work in taiwan so like their um wind power which is a rapidly expanding um energy sector for taiwan is danish and dutch but i think mostly danish so i don't know what they would you know what in what lines of business would align with the belt and road even if they could get in but what taiwan is trying to do is um encourage export manufacturing in the same countries that are targeted by the belton road not central asia you know central asia is china's backyard but southeast asia and south asia are strong targets of taiwanese uh business promotion yeah there's already been considerable investment in some of those places and certainly if uh you can export along this way it makes a great deal of sense uh the stories that that i'd be in a position to share uh are all sad ones so there's not not stories of of great success and they all involve come uh companies that are related to you know moving things along the belton road providing uh certain kinds of services let's shift if we could um one last question for a snapshot and that someone asked for a comparison between the impact of hong kong business and the impact of taiwanese business so the answer is somewhere along the line i decided i just wasn't gonna do that i just my uh you said that i i had had a short career but somebody on a at a faculty meeting today told me that i've been at davidson college 29 years so i didn't think i had enough time left to do hong kong as well i mean my my sense of hong kong is that their um that their investment was more localized in southern china um and taiwan certainly was localized in fujian jiangsu shanghai and southern china as well um but i really i i don't know enough to answer that question well okay that's that's great thank you and uh now let's move into the what might happen uh realm so we need a little bit of your well-informed crystal ball on this and we have a series of questions that move along the lines of okay in the push and pull between the united states and china what happens for taiwan how are taiwanese companies trying to cope we certainly know about taiwanese companies you know having to cope with uh changing or attitudes towards the taiwanese government the 85 degrees uh example comes to mind but maybe you could say something a little bit more about how this tech challenge especially since you you write so eloquently about tsmc and others in your book yeah i think you know decoupling uh between the u.s and the prc has a lot of risk for taiwan um the tsmc a major customer of tsmc has been huawei and when the us basically said you know we all have to shun huawei cut huawei out of our out out of our networks at at that time it was possible to replace that demand but that's not a strategy go you know for long-term success to just sort of say whenever uncle sam says you can't sell to those guys go find another customer because of another customers are hard to find um so i think that it is it is a real challenge because a lot of taiwanese companies are really dug in in the prc a company like foxconn you know i make on my iphone they can't move there's nowhere in the world where you can get 600 000 people in the same city to work for the same employer that just doesn't exist so they're they're they're diversifying by constructing plants outside of the prc but the basic iphone assembly stuff i mean that is really hard to move so they're working on automation try to get a lot of robots so that they don't have to have all those people but decoupling is a is a real challenge for taiwan and i think it's not it's also feels kind of symbolic because i also think politically it's not good for taiwan and so now i'm moving away from the content of my book a little bit to make more of a political statement but it worries me greatly when i see americans who think that the way to be pro-taiwan is to be anti-china because taiwan is right next to the prc and it is very intertwined with the prc and it is vulnerable to the prc so that's not to say that the way to take care of taiwan is just to roll over and and give beijing everything they want but it is to be smart and not just to to be kind of a knee-jerk anti-china policy because a knee-jerk anti-poli china policy sooner or later will come back to bite taiwan yeah i don't think people in taiwan ever lose sight of the geography but unfortunately some people outside uh do and may not fully understand too that china's rise in many respects has been very very good for taiwan uh certainly for the business people making money for the people who want to sell wedding photo packages uh to those couples to the people who are going to lounge in uh cafes or hotels or any number of other you know of these sorts of businesses or in other days they may have taken a package tour that took them to sun moon lake and that sort of thing so certainly china's rise uh changes the dynamic but in many respects it's been good and you highlight in your book that when many markets were closed because of the great financial crisis the fact that china was open for business was of benefit to taiwan yeah so i think that really comes through in your book i wanted to close though with a question uh where your book you know takes us the last several chapters that are focusing on the cultural influences the social influences things like that uh the expectation of course is that content contact is to increase knowledge increase understanding lessen fears that sort of thing but in some respects that hasn't happened and i was wondering if you could you know conclude with a statement about you know what what are the legacies of this at first you know weird sort of development where nobody had a plan uh but taiwanese businesses plunged in and how that has played out so you know one of the things that kind of drives me crazy is that there are a lot of people out there who who want to say that there was a golden age of crosstrait relations back before all of this taiwanese identity and independence stuff wrecked it when i went to taiwan for the first time in 1982 the mainland china was called gongfe communist bandits and people really meant i mean like no one had ever been there who who wasn't you know who hadn't been there in uniform 40 years earlier people hadn't been there they didn't know people from there was just no interaction and there was a lot of fear and hostility so this opportunity to know each other i think has mitigated a lot of that fear and hostility and created a lot of opportunities for although in my book i point out that there is no such thing as win-win in china this is something that i learned from reading taeshang literature but you know it was kind of a win-win thing i think the problem is that ultimately in the prc there is ambition for unification or annexation of taiwan that makes the how friendly they can people can be limited it limits how close and how much trust can exist because everybody in taiwan kind of knows like a lot of people say i'm not worried because you know i know like taishong that you talk to this i'm not worried you know taiwanese they the mainland people are all about business they just want to get money we're working well together there's no reason for something bad to happen and people in taiwan say why would they attack us that's so dumb but we all know that you know churning in the background for the prc leadership at all times and now increasingly projected on to the prc population is this idea that the existence of taiwan as it is today is an affront and has to be um that that a front needs to be addressed and so you know i feel like we got another 40 years of peace and stability but the truth is that the prc is not clearly committed in the long run to peace and stability and no amount of friendliness on the taiwan side is going to change that that comes through in the book the uh you i i won't quote you exactly because i've forgotten the exact words but you talk about ambiguity and ambivalence being baked in that there are opportunities but also hazards and that is no less true today than it has been and in fact you've highlighted uh the issue of vulnerability with all of your eggs in this proverbial basket that and you you know you you mentioned that also in your comments when you're talking about it's easier to find a supplier than to find a customer and to do these kinds of uh these kinds of things uh professor shelly rigger i just want to say thank you uh for your wonderful presentation uh for your openness and clarity in the q a section i also want to thank you for this wonderful book that i hope everybody who's joined us today and everybody who watches this subsequent video will go out and get it's a terrific it's a terrific resource but i also want to thank all of the people who are with us now uh and who have chosen to learn more about the relationship across the taiwan strait and it's really really fascinating history uh thank you shelley it's been terrific you are very welcome i hope we do this again soon in person uh that would be ideal come on come on over to l.a friends thank you all you
vtSh3JyjS4M,Barry Naughton On China’s Economic Rise,"Lessons from China’s Economic Rise: what economists expected and what surprised them. Barry Naughton reviews what economists correctly anticipated from China’s economic reforms and what they didn’t expect (and why). He discusses what China’s policies mean for the country’s future and its ties with others. Naughton is an accomplished analyst of China’s economy. His textbooks on China’s economy are the most widely used. His 2011 and 2016 presentations at USCI conferences captured key issues of the moment and anticipated the challenges of today. 

Barry Naughton holds the So Kwanlok Chair of Chinese International Affairs at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego. Prof. Naughton is a prolific author, writing for both specialized and general audiences. He wrote Growing Out of the Plan: Chinese Economic Reform, 1978-1993 and contributed chapters to and edited many other books including Reforming Asian Socialism, The China Circle: Economics and Technology in the PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong, Holding China Together: Diversity and Integration in the Post-Deng Era. He is the author of the widely-used textbook on China’s economy: The Chinese Economy: Adaptation and Growth (a revision of his earlier The Chinese Economy: Transitions and Growth). In addition to his articles in academic journals, he is a regular contributor to the China Leadership Monitor.

USCI Director Clayton Dube and USC Marshall School of Business Prof. Nan Jia moderated the event.",1,so today we're looking at reform era china and we have professor barry naughton who's going to be talking with us about his recent contribution to a terrific book that uh hopefully many of you will get and benefit as i have from reading it's called engaging china and it's edited by ann thurston and it's come out from columbia university press uh professor natan will talk more about that in just a moment but we're joined today as our co-host we have professor nanja with us from the usc marshall school of business uh professor jaw is a distinguished scholar she joined usc in 2009 and she is the gra a graduate of beijing university and the university of toronto she's widely published just to highlight some recent articles she's been writing on corporate governance and innovation uh the connection between the two she's looked at ownership patterns and whether or not that works out well for the overall company's success she's looked at political questions political embeddedness and strategic use of political connections uh she's a terrific member of the university of southern california faculty and we're delighted to have her with us today she's also an academic leader she's one of the hosts one of the leaders in a regular seminar that looks at economics and business in china so we're delighted to have professor zhao with us and she'll join in asking questions during the q a session but our lead speaker today is professor barry naughton who's not a stranger to usc microphones although today's microphone is in his own office uh he has spoken for us a couple of times and i would encourage you and we'll put links up in the chat a little bit later to look at that those earlier presentations in 2011 and in 2016. in 2011 he was our lead off speaker at a conference focusing on the state of the chinese economy and he highlighted key issues that have really dominated discussion about china's economy and issues connected to china's economy over the ensuing decade five years later we had him back and he participated in our china card conference which looked at politics and policy in the united states towards china and he took us on a deep dive on some of the issues that china was combating internally but also some of the political spillover here in the united states you know with that he is he publishes widely uh one of his articles uh that he actually cites in this particular chapter but which i read a couple years ago has the very provocative title is china socialist and that was published in 2017 he looked at if china was socialist what characteristics would it have and then compared that with what he saw on the ground professor naughton has written extensively on these questions uh his first book growing out of the plan chinese economic reform 1978 to 1993 in fact won the ohio prize uh a true a true honor before this path-breaking work he's subsequently contributed as an editor to many different volumes and has participated in the creation of three widely used textbooks the first of those is the michigan book china adapting the past confronting the future but he is the sole author of the two most influential textbooks used to teach about china's economy in 2007 the chinese economy transitions in growth and then a revamped version of that the chinese economy adaptation and growth which came out in 2018. professor naughton holds the so-con lot chair of chinese international affairs at ucsd the university of california san diego's school of global policy and strategy we are so happy to have you back with us barry please the floor is yours thank you so much clay gosh what a warm uh introduction i feel i feel very welcome and at home this is the um the story of me looking back trying to be retrospective and think about how we understood china's economy over the past few decades and what we got right as economists in particular and what we got wrong now obviously this is a big topic right because there's a like everything in america today there is a highly politicized version of this question uh the highly politicized version says uh americans got china wrong they thought it was gonna be a prosperous semi-democracy how foolish they were now we have to be realistic um that's you know way oversimplified but i think it really makes sense for people to go back and and try to be explicit about what they thought then what they expected uh and uh and the ways in which things turned out differently because nobody has a crystal ball and when we're you know when we look at the emergence of china over 40 plus years of course this is the biggest most ground shaking event changing the world that we live in in the past few decades so of course we're not going to understand the whole thing so let's go back and see what we got right and what we didn't anticipate and in the process of that maybe there are a few areas as well where we should be critiquing our judgment and and thinking about how we could have done it a little bit better now this you know my effort is not something that i came up with it's part of a a project a conference that was convened as a kind of festive for mike lampton who of course as you know has been contributing fundamental work about chinese politics and u.s china relations since the 1970s uh he's retiring from some of his uh some of his jobs and uh as you might expect if you know mike he didn't want some kind of celebratory mishmash fest strip kind of thing he wanted a group of scholars to come together and look at a set of clearly related focused questions so actually i can't take any credit for the title what did we get right what did we get wrong all those kind of things that was actually the the assignment for everybody who participated in the conference i have to say the others really aren't very good at following instructions i don't think anybody else really tried to answer that question what do we get right what do we get wrong that doesn't mean their chapters aren't great they are really really interesting but what happened is people tended to um pick crucial critical issues and and critical events where perhaps uh an opportunity was missed or where engagement what looked like engagement to the united states maybe didn't look like engagement to china and you know all kinds of different and very very creative uh perspectives um i guess maybe from a lack of imagination or something i just did what i was told to do and and that was to say what did what did we think then what did we get right and what did we get wrong and so as part of that in in carrying through with that i uh sort of ended up with a paper in three parts the first part is what we got right which is pretty simple but very very fundamental the second part will be about what we didn't incorporate into our viewpoint at that time but you'll see that what i'm going to argue is it's not realistic to have expected us to incorporate these things into our viewpoint at that time and in particular nobody in for example the 1980s or even the early 1990s could possibly have envisioned the dramatic restructuring of the global economy of global production network of the american corporation uh and some other things but that's that's probably the biggest thing and and and that the impact of of the set of unanticipated events most of which are bigger than china they involve china but they're also bigger than china the impact of almost all of these was to accelerate china's rise and accelerate the speed with which its impact on the rest of the world had to be was felt and had to be adapted to so the the basic theme of the second movement is uh it's an allegro movement in other words that there was a acceleration of change due to a a whole set of different factors uh and that in some ways made it more difficult for the world to absorb china and integrate china smoothly into the world economy and then the third part is a is well what did we get wrong and of course we could say there are a number of things we got wrong but the basic idea is going to be that economists in particular because of our focus on the process of economic reform i think we're late to grasp the fact that after jurongji the the objectives of chinese policymakers really shifted in fundamental ways and we can start to trace this shift as early as 2005 certainly 2006 before the global financial crisis but then intensified by the global financial crisis and that are the delay in sort of recognizing the way that china's had changed china had changed and the reasons for that change have made it a little bit more difficult and contributed to the very difficult opposition between china and the united states which seems to be so firmly embedded in our relationship right now so in other words i think it's part of understanding how things went not just went wrong in the sense between china and the us but but why they went so wrong so fast and why it's so hard for us to get out of it and so hard for the chinese to get out of it as well assuming that they want to all right so that's the basic uh structure of this talk let me start with the the first thing uh foreseeing a china miracle i mean you sometimes hear people say that uh oh we never imagined that china could grow so fast for so long and there's a little bit of truth to that in the sense that china did grow a little faster and a little longer than probably most people predicted but the basic idea that china in the 1980s could be a miracle economy that it could grow very very fast for a couple of decades that definitely was what economists predicted and what they were talking about what was structuring their their thinking and i think the clearest example of this is this this great book by dwight perkins by perkins kind of the dean of china economist at harvard uh sort of half a generation older than really anybody else who's uh who's a major analyst of china um and you know back in 1986 he looked at the situation he's you know he put a question mark at the end of the title asia's next economic giant question mark but that's just him being cautious it's quite obvious when you read the book that what he's saying is look japan south korea taiwan they did this and china's going to do it too that's the basic fundamental point of the book what's interesting about this quote is what's the limit that he sees in this it's it's food production right which nobody talks about today right china has enough food no there's no doubt about that but you know as we started this process and this is already 1986 so uh china had already experienced tremendous gains in the rural sector following the adoption of the responsibility system uh but still you know here perkins was seeing the potential constraint on the agricultural side on the food side as being the one thing that might hold china back and so since we know in retrospect that that was in fact resolved fairly smoothly um you know that just shows us that the the prediction of a dramatic sustained rise from china is something that was uh valid i think it's fair to say this was widely accepted by economists at the time true there was a minority group that claimed that gradual reforms couldn't work and that therefore china wasn't doing enough but that within the china economics community that was always a pretty small group and this viewpoint really informed economists views through the 1990s because a really funny thing happened in the 1990s of course tiananmen was this huge shock to the political system to deeply undermine the position of reformers the conservatives reactionaries really were in charge of economic policy for about three years from the middle of 1989 at least until 1991 so many many people became pessimistic about china and economists were a little bit pessimistic immediately after tiananmen but quickly swung to optimism and the reason they swung to optimism was that in the early 1990s china started to do bold things to revivify the economic reform agenda there's actually a you know a document from one of these third plenums right there are many famous third plenums in china's uh political history and one of them was in 1993 and it listed you know 50 things they were going to do to be honest at the time including economist nobody took it that seriously because we had all been living through a dozen plus years where policy was incremental would move forward would go back no blueprints ever made any sense you know lots of policies succeeded but there was never any sense of design grand design to the process so nobody took the third plenum uh manifesto very seriously except that in the next couple of years all of the things that got laid out in this blueprint started to get done right and so economists being focused on that piece of the puzzle really started to look at um really started to think of the chinese policy process as something that was working something that was functional in particular in its ability to sometimes pay short time costs in order to reap long-term benefits i have a quote in the article from um sorry i have a difficulty remembering people's names now but um i'll think of it in a second but he's he he talks about china in the wake of the global financial crisis sorry the asian financial crisis of course that's way back 1997 he says china's in just as deep a hole as anybody else but china is digging out more quickly than the other east asian economies and i think that really was sort of a brilliant observation that captured what was going on in china in the 1990s um and so by the time we got to the turn of the century and george had agreed on the terms of wto membership world trade organization membership uh he had taken the really tough steps to close down a lot of the state enterprise sector um and so these were the really really hard things that were essential to sort of completing the first era of china's economic reform so economists were especially optimistic and especially satisfied they felt in some sense that china had made it now what happened at that time if we put ourselves back at the beginning of the 2000s right so we're looking at at this economy the chinese economy that uh as i said the second ago has apparently made it i mean they you know they passed this hurdle that uh a lot of people said they could never do right to shrink the state enterprise sector laid off 40 million people right in state in factories and collective factories um and manage their way through that really difficult period so what what do we expect then well frankly we expected the pace of change to slow down right i mean the tough stuff had been done yes there was going to be a benefit from these reforms and so growth would benefit from it but on the other hand a lot of people thought that the very high growth period was over and that you know china's growth would slow down and actually remember a conference in uh in beijing in 2001 that the development research council of the state council called because some people had been telling them that china's growth momentum was going to play out and there would be a big slow down and so they decided to have a conference on this topic and um and and to their credit they invited about half and half domestic and international economists something you can't quite imagine happening today uh and there was a consensus around the room no china's not gonna slow down a lot but it will probably slow down a little so that's what everybody thought and it didn't happen instead china accelerated now here's something that we economists didn't anticipate the acceleration of china's growth after about 20 2004. a lot of which has to do certainly with its entry into wto because exports took off at especially rapid increase and so the potential that was always there for sort of export-led growth which hadn't really been the case before there have been some of it but now all of a sudden boom this caused an acceleration this we didn't anticipate now what's going on i think to understand that acceleration we need to bring in four factors it's not just a single factor not just wto membership it's four different things that i call accelerators because they either removed constraints or they made the process of economic growth easier increased productivity increase lowering transaction costs so the first was the impact of the demographic dividend demographic dividend meaning a window of opportunity right where because birth rates are falling and death rates are falling there's a window that opens up where the labor force grows very quickly while the dependency rate declines everybody knew that would happen but people didn't pay as much attention 20 years ago or 30 years ago to the importance of demographic dividend as they do today and what it meant for china was that in the 1990s urban labor markets went through a surprisingly rapid transformation in the 70s of course everybody was terrified about unemployment due to surplus labor and then all of a sudden in the 1990s the growth rate of the urban labor force slowed way down as lower birth rates among the urban population kicked in and it became increasingly obvious first of all that well china could reduce employment at state-owned enterprises and not face a revolution you know because people would generally speaking be able to find new jobs even if it takes them a while but even more important that it was okay to start reducing the barriers that kept rural people out of the cities and so by the late 1990s we start to see this and then especially after the turn of the century right the pace of migration steps up because demographic conditions are more favorable right there are fewer new urban workers and so there's room especially as exports boom there's room for rural to urban migration to take off and that means abundant cheap labor powering the export boom that's going on exports are pulling the labor labor is keeping costs low it's a virtuous cycle that reminds us of what happened in japan korea and taiwan earlier but was even more powerful just because it's bigger but also for other related reasons the second accelerator was the information technology revolution right of course we just take it for granted today that i t hardware is at the core of of many of the issues between china and the united states but it's exactly at this time right the end of the 1990s in the beginning of the 2000s that new communications technology falls in place so broadband communication cell phones you know fax machines at first and then broadband software connections all these things happen at about the same time and in 2001 the end of 2001 which is just as china's going into the wto taiwan decides okay companies in taiwan that produce laptop computers and desktop computers you may start to move assembly and other types of relatively sensitive operations over to the mainland we're both going into the world trade organization things are opening up we feel a little bit more secure that barrier is being reduced of course the quotas on textile and garments were also eliminated at the same time so so even beyond just wto there are these other factors that are giving an additional boost to china and this these technological factors weren't just affecting china of course they were affecting the united states as well american corporations were arguably some of the leaders american corporations and taiwan corporations and korea corporations were the leaders of this process american corporations that had been you know arguably out competed by japan japanese corporations in the 80s and early 90s now started to come back and establish their dominance in many information technology hardware spheres and as they establish this new model of disaggregated production networks that meant they could retain certain key links within the united states they could cooperate with korean and taiwan firms to carry out other key technology intensive links but keep them in taiwan or korea and then outsource lots of labor-intensive production to wherever labor costs were lower well where were labor costs lower of course in china in the china mainland and so there was this massive global restructuring it wasn't because of china right but china was a big driver of it because it had such strong capabilities combined was still such low wages in part because of this flood of rural to urban migrants right so that facilitated the global process and of course in turn this became a big driver of china's export growth and ultimately its gdp growth so if we put these factors together we can say do we understand now why china's growth accelerated after 2004 and the answer would be yeah yeah we do between 2004 and 2010 china rode this incredible export driven boom where the export boom was in turn in fact driven by this global restructuring of production networks um and then finally this the speed of this process and of course we could spend you know day we could have a whole conference on this process how it worked uh what the strengths and the shortcomings were but let's just pull back for a second from china to the united states and my point here is simple that for the united states to deal with the impact of china it would have been a lot easier if the process was a little slower instead what we saw was this very very rapid restructuring and it meant that u.s winners were bigger winners faster and and that meant in particular big corporations because big corporations could see that all this was happening they had people in charge of logistics over at apple uh that's you know that's where there were people who could say ah you know we can move the assembly part over to china and save a bunch of money there apple's emergence as the world's most profitable corporation in some years also dates from this from this program right and so look at the change within the u.s economy if we just look at all corporate profits as a share of gdp look at this shift that occurs right around 2002. so in other words just as china is taking off and accelerating so american corporations are experiencing this sort of step up in profitability a step up in profitability that has been maintained all the way through the present which means ultimately that shareholders and pension funds that are invested in shares have done quite well because corporate profits have been strong growing as fast as or faster than gdp now i'm not claiming here that oh china is the driver of all this um but china is a park driver right china is one of the things that's going on here and it enables u.s corporations to carry through this restructuring process that definitely improves economic efficiency definitely improves corporate profitability and definitely widens income gaps in the united states between people who share in the corporate bounty either because they're executives or their shareholders and people who didn't either because they're poor to begin with and have no assets or more importantly because there are workers in factories that uh were import competing sectors in other words that felt the flood of felt the competitive impact of the flood of chinese imports and this is definitely something that we got wrong the economist government the economists have a very standard way to look at what happens to the economy when it had it faces new kinds of trade and the the way that we look at it virtually all economists look at it is there are adjustment costs there is friction but econom economies are pretty flexible pretty adaptable and you know adjustment maybe takes 18 months in most cases something like that uh and then factors of production meaning workers and capital and land move into new use that's higher productivity and lower cost from the imports so everybody is potentially better off and you know what economists discovered when they looked at this crucial period and and hear the the crucial work was this piece by auteur dorn and hanson in the american economic review around 2018 uh shows that that adjustment process just didn't work that because the impact was so great right that the and so fast that what happened is instead of having formerly uh uh manufacturing districts that were impacted by imports instead of having them shift into new kinds of production or services what happened was there were essentially miniature local recessions or depressions where employment dropped even employment in non-manufacturing sectors because there were fewer wages there was less demand they just weren't able to adjust properly so by the time we get to the global financial crisis in 2009 people are already feeling pain right american parts of american society are feeling pain there's more anger uh there's more frustration and there's more of a sense that elites who've told people that this process was manageable and was going to end up working for everybody every month so in other words four accelerators that put together increased china's growth even beyond what we had anticipated back in the 80s gave it an additional almost decade of very high speed growth and also made the economic and political issues between the two countries much tenser and more difficult to resolve so here's the corporate profits that i showed you um and uh and so that's full stop that's one uh that's the second movement so there's also a third movement and that is that i argue that we did get something wrong in my view because economists were so focused on a set of issues about market-oriented economic reform we saw that in the 90s and throughout the premiership of jerome g that the desire to push china towards a more efficient market economy was clearly the predominant objective of the chinese leaders that mattered and of course for economists we were also meeting on a quasi-regular basis with our counterparts with economists in china who absolutely shared those same objectives they thought as we did that as long as china persevered in the economic reform process that it would be uh that that would continue to contribute to uh further economic growth and improvement of living standards for everybody and as a result it took us a long time to see i think that after juwonji stepped down and one jab all became the premier and the objective of policymakers in china began to undergo a fundamental change of course they never swung to become against economic reform market-oriented reform because after all if you can if you can achieve other objectives that you want and also have a more efficient market economy why not but policy makers began to be much more concerned with carrying out other national objectives and in particular national strength and new kind of high-tech drivers but also a set of policies that we might with all do uh uh with all due hesitation call common prosperity of course it's just been reintroduced by xi jinping as a as a key objective but we can already see that in the 2000s whereas chironjia had neglected some of the sort of social welfare functions of government punjab clearly came in and said hey we've neglected this for a while let's let's bring some of these uh measures in and in retrospect let's look at a a graph it's actually a graph that i've been following literally for decades because it shows so clearly that in the 90s that low point there in 1995 just shows that in the early phases of reform even though there were many many successes those successes came at the cost of a reduction in state capacity in terms of the government's ability to get stuff done right and so the turnaround in 1995 is a remarkable thing because it shows the success of economic reforms especially tax reform but also a set of other uh market related reforms that also contributed to this recovery and i think it makes sense to say wow at this low point the low point in the valley here china really faced some sort of existential challenges could it do could it achieve the goals they wanted to achieve it really wasn't clear they had to reform right and and so when we get up to let's say 2006 notice we're kind of uh near 20 of gdp as a budgetary revenue and we've got a balanced budget there for a year and you know i think outside economists tend to look at this as good this means the reform based institutional uh innovations have done their job this vindicates reform and hopefully will allow a new period of renewed economic reform but it didn't happen and it didn't happen largely because for policy makers it was more the case that previously they had been driven to reform by the absolute need to for example welcome foreign investment in high-tech fields in order to develop those sectors that they saw as being part of the future but now after a few years into the century they were starting to look at a situation where they had money they had resources and they had the opportunity to choose among different kinds of political objectives here's a different kind of graph that shows uh that it's not just fiscal revenues it's also other things like land revenues social insurance premiums so that the overall fiscal position became much more comfortable and of course i'm not even talking here about how they resurrect the banking system and and create credit reserves which can are also available to support the objectives of um of policy makers so so what happens i mean wenjabao was he a success or not well actually in one area when java was a huge success right he rebuilds rural services creates a you know rudimentary public health system begins a very modest program of industrial policy rebuilding military strength etc etc all these things not easy to achieve and so an impressive record but on the other hand in terms of economic reform he really sort of doesn't achieve anything and so we should have seen back there that the basket was changing and after the global financial crisis when java actually makes a statement at the national people's congress where he says yeah of course we have a market economy and market forces should play their role you know yeah we've all agreed about that but what's new is now we have to make best use of the socialist systems advantages which enable us to make decisions efficiently organize effectively and concentrate resources to accomplish large undertakings in other words he's saying yeah we got a market economy but now the key thing is to use state power to achieve the things that we really want so here's the last slide the conclusion the focus on reform a market-oriented reform it really helped economists get ahead of the game in the 1990s but in a sense i think keeping that focus on economic reform and not seeing how the other objectives of policymakers were now at least as important and maybe more important meant that economists kind of slipped behind the curve in a way so that some of the changes that uh certainly xi jinping since xi jinping came to power in 2012 have been very surprising very dramatic and very tough for the rest of the world to stomach as we analyze china's behavior as we figure out how to adapt to to china's you know much greater influence and and activism and engagement with the world as we think about say the world trade organization as we think about the imf there's sometimes a tendency to think that oh china's still driven by market-oriented reform considerations i think it's pretty clear that it's not that xi jinping in particular has a new model of maximizing national strength and if if market oriented reforms help him do that fine but if they don't then he's not interested and i think this is a change that economists were a little bit late in seeing even though they got the big picture basically right all right i'll stop there barry thank you so much for this wonderful presentation uh based on your chapter in the engaging china book uh you've told the story of how a relatively poor china becomes an economic superpower and how success uh in one realm uh doesn't mean that the same priorities will continue and so that's very much evident in your presentation again friends we welcome you to contribute to our discussion by submitting your questions via the q a button but right now let's turn to professor nanja from usc to raise a question for professor nan thank you so much clay and and and thank you so much barry is always a it's a it's always a great pleasure to uh uh to listen to your presentation have a and have a conversation i enjoyed your enjoyed your presentation and and also your book chapter um so for those who haven't haven't read the book chapter it was written with such clarity about very complex problems and yet with such modesty and openness for that it invites uh discussion so i do have some questions i want i'd like to to raise it to you to see what you think about these issues um you have provided very clear illustration of um some strong top-down forces that that actually it's that steered china into the reform direction and also maybe changing course i was i was wondering that if you could share your thoughts on some maybe there are some bottom-up approaches or some bottom-up forces for example the reform is like the train is moving in around the rail and you can derail it but then there would be hopefully some resistance of of of switching course into let's say a much less market-oriented uh direction so i was wondering what you think about um that option well actually uh not alternative forces maybe somewhat simultaneous force that is at work yeah yeah i think that that completely makes sense um but what's funny in a way is if we if we go back to the sort of mid mid point of the first decade of the 21st century um [Music] you know economists are all enthusiastic oh look what we've achieved but i think the feeling among the chinese population forgive me for sort of imputing to hundreds of millions of people a feeling it's kind of ridiculous but but i think the feeling was more um oh we need a rest we need a break from reform we're we're much better off but for that reason we can afford to go a little bit more slowly so i don't think that policymakers felt pressured at that at that point and and really in a way to me one of the greatest mysteries is how come people don't go around talking about how great jurong g is well of course partly it's because you know we've got a new gang in town and they don't really want us to talk about general g very much but i think it's also because people people forget you know people associate the junji with the pain and they don't of of unemployment i mean in particular people in cities and they don't show associate him so much with the subsequent economic acceleration even though that could never have happened without all the things he did so so i agree a fuller theory would certainly need to to bring in grassroots and bottom-up forces much more fully yeah and some of those grassroots forces of course is you know are the local party officials and you know these folks who have to meet ends you know when you have that financial revenue gap that you're talking about uh they're the ones that are on the front lines of that uh barry uh thank you for highlighting jurong g he comes through in the chapter as this uh under-appreciated hero of the chinese economic reform and economic growth now over and over you mentioned that one of the remarkable things about the chinese party state and you see it as a great strength was that it was able under jurong g for example to do hard things that in the short term had serious costs that inflicted real pain on tens if not hundreds of millions of people but that there was uh an awareness that there would be a long-term benefit and a willingness to sacrifice in the short term for that long-term benefit now at the conclusion you were just talking about you know uh or in response to none you were saying uh about diminished levels of happiness and things like that that people were ready for a break by 2003 maybe we need to lighten up on economic reform but can you come back to this question about being able to make short-term sacrifices in order to achieve hard long-term gains is the chinese party state still capable of that that's a very good question and a difficult one i mean we know uh i don't know if you recall back in uh back in the early 90s um larry lau and and ying chien uh at stanford talked about a reform without losers uh which they recommended as a as a great way to get reforms going but also kind of implied that the system was fragmented enough that was very hard to impose costs on people even if they were necessary and good for the uh good for the society as a whole so churanji seemed to have this window where first of all you know all the elders had passed on so there was really nobody looking over his shoulder except john zamen who was basically supportive and he had this you know state crisis that he could sort of point to to people and say this is not a joke you know we've got to do this so i i do think that was to a certain extent a temporary set of conditions at the same time it seems like xi jinping has amassed so much power and yet we do see this pattern where a lot of difficult reforms have have failed right not and not because they've been applied and didn't work and caused all these costs but because they cause some disruption and then they're pulled back and i think i feel like i don't understand that well enough uh if that is system characteristic or is it just xi jinping's extreme security uh cautiousness i just don't know yeah barry i think this is a this is a nice moment to actually loop in one of the questions raised by one of our audience mr edward story who asks you to comment on whether the u.s can learn something about industrial policies in china and he made this i thought it's kind of interesting he made a comment that the only place where i can see he sees in the u.s that having that industrial policy is the department of defense other than that is missing i was i was wondering how would you comment on this question yeah i you know i think i i mean i think there's there's something to that um [Music] but i guess i mean i guess let me let me start by sort of laying out what i think my ideal is i mean my ideal would be what we might call a soft-touch industrial policy based on a robust democracy right so that people participate in this and there are lots of checks on it um so do we have stuff we can learn from china sure of course you know it's a it's a huge great country that does lots and lots of things um and does it make sense for us to move a little bit away from the kind of you know super market fundamentalist ideology absolutely but let's not move too far you know i think if we move uh i think china's way too far over on the state-led side if we move a little that's fine but let's not go too far because that's not our relative strength now thank you for that and that's related to an another point that you make in this you know in your presentation where you show that public revenues are greater than 30 of gdp and so this is you know hugely impressive right that state capacity is at this level and even though common prosperity poverty alleviation or various themes uh china has massive inequality and maybe you could say something about this uh does it come down to having a rich and therefore uh capable state was that the only goal well maybe it was the the fundamental goal on which other goals were based um and you know which obviously would resonate in terms of chinese history would resonate in terms of the communist party uh and its objectives and goals so i think probably we underestimated that and and that probably a lot of people in china just saw that as the you know as the the precondition for everything else um today i mean it it's funny probably a lot of people have in the audience and probably clay yourself have been looking at the speech that she's being made uncommon prosperity and of course it's so it's striking that he basically promises nothing uh it's almost like well we're going to talk about common prosperity and we're going to ask the rich people to help but that's because right now i'm really not comfortable putting any more actual resources into it and so i think that's uh that shows that's revealed preference as economists say there's plenty of money there they could uh put money into more social services but they would rather put it into industrial policy that's great um and barry i also have a question about uh um actually a bigger question about what you think about uh the inevitability of this change of course when i read your chapter i i had i thought i saw two sets of arguments one is that this might be some sort of a concerted effort in that we have we now have weak states capacity so therefore we're going to do this reform but once we become stronger we're going to scale back and so for example you raise the example of how china did not really carry out the promises to wto to actually um to to substantively um there you but then you also mentioned this very interesting debate actually within the party of which direction to go and once that somehow got over overwhelmed by the other side so what do you see of this word is it is coincidentally we happen to have this leader whoever says you know the power and ego um i wonder what is your sense of uh is this is it is there a kind of almost deterministic causal reason why we're going to see this change or or there is a bit of a randomness in there i'm a big believer in randomness so i i don't wanna um i don't wanna claim inevitability in this um i think uh if we had been stepping back a little bit you know 20 years ago and saying well wait a minute when they resolve these problems where are they going to go we probably should have plugged in more the idea that once china becomes a strong state again it's going to behave in different ways so i think we should we should have seen that it was inevitable that it would be a factor but the outcome no i don't think it's inevitable at all i think um [Music] uh you know the personalities i remember a reform-oriented economist in china tell me around 2005-2006 uh we're hopeful that who jintao will unite you know with a more of the reform wing and push forward a new wave of reform and he could have but he didn't want to why did he not want to i don't know why he didn't want to but for whatever reason he didn't you know i think that could have happened um maybe if the global financial crisis hadn't occurred that would have made a big difference to uh not that that caused things but that there were trends already in place and then the global financial crisis kind of ended arguments in some ways i think so yeah and even today i mean we've got these two great powers neither seems to be able to figure out a way to take a step back you know i mean there are risks in everything but can nobody take a risk in stepping back i mean i think china has a lot to gain by stepping back from confrontation but they don't seem in the least bit interested at this moment leadership makes obviously a giant difference uh we've been talking now about the current leadership you highlight in your chapter and in your presentation previous leaderships and talk about leadership groups and talk about that uh it's really uh like non i think that this is a wonderful chapter it should be mandatory reading for so many people and one of the things that has come up in the q a where uh for example eric heyer and some others have been talking about american responses to china's rise and in the you know the the united states wanted china to join the wto uh under certain conditions including that china would meet various obligations and eric has asked you know uh should we have asked for more uh what you know was that was that an option these kinds of these kinds of things in your presentation you highlighted this long-term corporate trend uh in a new direction in corporate america uh in the chapter you use financialization as as this term and so you know overall uh you know you you have automation you have all of these different factors you have outsourcing and these kinds of things uh and yet profits go up and you know that's great for shareholders not so great uh for people in certain communities that you know otter and others look at can you say a little bit more about american expectations on the political side and now what uh americans ought to ought to expect from their leaders uh sure that's an easy question huh um first of all hi eric good to hear from you um i don't think the problem was with the wto accession agreement um i think uh that really the us did a remarkable job at sort of pushing china to commit to certain things that were specifically designed to sort of make the chinese system more transparent and and put some clear boundaries around certain policies the problem is more that uh in 2004 567 the u.s kind of lost interest in this and lost interest in the wto didn't push china too much at what were at first modest uh falling away and of course the wto courts are very very legalistic so for instance you know if you subsidize an export that's clearly wrong if you subsidize an entire industry that's okay you know so uh because in general nobody could imagine that somebody would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize entire industries um so i don't think the problems with wto um uh i you know what should we be doing now i mean i think we should make clear to china that there are ways to stabilize competition but um i don't think um i don't think there's any appetite in the united states in either party for a more generous policy shall we say which because people feel that that hasn't achieved results and so i think we're just looking for a modis vivendi you know i want to go to to nan for another question but uh perhaps today we have this announcement that uh xi jinping and joe biden are to have some sort of virtual summit uh over the next week and we had the announcement of some sort of agreement to cooperate on climate change and so maybe this is leadership stepping at least sideways on confrontation uh i think this is a great thing yeah i strongly support stepping sideways thank you and and non we we have a only a few more minutes but let me go to nan now for uh another question thank you clay uh let me ask a question that actually um is resonates with one of the questions raising in q a but alicia webb's question which is this balance between soe state and enterprises and private owned enterprises and in fact yesterday in the workshop we had a ton gonzo visiting us and we had this discussion of um even prior to see we have already had this quoting quote the state advances in private retreats and looks like it's ongoing so would you would you it's dangerous to predict but would you say that like the private sector the development is going to further contract and to be dominated by the by the state of that sector altogether i don't know if i'd go that far but what worries me a lot is that um this the share of the state sector has has at least stabilized and maybe it's increasing but i don't i don't i haven't i don't think the data is good enough for the last couple years to know for sure but in any case it's stabilized but the party is now specifically telling state-owned enterprises to be you know members of the national team they're not just supposed to be maximizing profits and and acting like you know profit maximizing market-oriented corporations which is what the idea was uh back in the early years of the 2000s they're expected to do a bunch of other things and that means it's it's harder to hold them to performance it means they have weak softer budget constraints and now this is spreading into the private sector uh where uh you know obviously if you were running one of the big internet companies you'd have to you have to think a lot now about what the party wants what the government wants you know you have to be very very careful so um yes we definitely need to watch whether the state share increases but i'm also maybe even more worried about the deteriorating incentive environment both within the state sector and within the private sector and that speaks to a feedback loop uh that you highlight in the chapter about getting messages not just to those running these businesses but state policy makers uh that sort that you know that particular issue and in the chapter in your presentation and in earlier presentations you've talked about uh you know the gigantic investment in these strategic industries uh and again you've been talking about that to our audience for quite some time and you've suggested that the returns on that have been uh disappointing in many respects and this speaks to what you were just talking with not about uh you know where you have true in truly innovative private companies that have become globally competitive in the tech sector and others and yet those now are undergoing some you know some reassessment and the leaders of those companies don't quite know what to do so maybe you could say something about this feedback loop uh that provided the right information to the right people at the right time well of course i mean for economists the easy answer is well markets are a really good feedback loop and so you know restricting the scope of markets really hurts um i think right now 2021 china's doing two things that really limit that the effective feedback one is in terms of industrial policy they're no longer just investing in the areas where they think hey this is a target of opportunity they're also saying oh this is a vulnerable point we have to invest there too even though we have no comparative advantage we know we're going to lose money but we have to do it because of the security challenge from the united states so that's going to really mess up the assessment of what the return to investment is because it's going to be much lower and that means growth is presumably going to be much lower the second is yeah this idea that there are certain things that we don't want to do and that private firms can't do too much so that for the first time since really 1978 government policy is saying no no there are certain types of economic activity that we want less of um which i think is not promising for the chinese economy uh thank you uh nan do you have a question i think we're running short on time right we we are we are getting closer to that witching hour and in the chapter barry you also highlight that one of the problems for a propaganda state is while information flows up so that you can get some information everybody else is getting a different message much of the time or an incomplete one and maybe you could say something about the role of information and how information flows have become more constrained in the current era um it's great if i said in the chapter i don't remember what i said at all but that sounds that sounds right i mean uh you know if we go back to 2005 uh you know china wasn't a perfect place by any means but it it it sure was good enough if you know what i mean i mean from the standpoint of of an outsider it's like why would you criticize this system seems to work pretty good there's a diversity of voices there's a there's a emphasis on competitive markets again it's not perfect but the assumption is that most sectors can be driven by markets so we're getting information both from the both from the economy and from different different voices in the public sphere not even thinking about you know wechat and things like that but just publications that are that are uh widespread um so you know we've seen a steady tightening of that incrementally for for 15 years now at first the steps were pretty small but they sure haven't stopped so um i think it you know there are i mean i i don't want to be a china bear but i think you have to say that there we can see you know five six seven eight things that we predict should reduce the performance of the chinese economy and maybe we're starting to see that in some areas thank you for that and thank you for you know a career of research that has made it possible for you to speak with such clarity on such an important issue highlighting and i should again remind audiences go and look at those uh 2011 talk that 2016 talk uh professor naughton was already talking about the demographic dividend that pays off big in the 1990s and early 2000s but now is posing some great challenges uh he anticipates uh this emphasis on indigenous innovation and then the the current made in china 2025 plan the emphasis on dominating strategic industrial sectors there's really so much there for for everyone uh to consume but i'd like to offer the last the last comment uh to you know you professor naughton but first if none if you have a concluding question please feel free to ask it um i actually was so one of the audience asked a question that we discussed you know i'll be discussing with my colleagues for i would say multiple years so far uh but um um it's very difficult okay we'll have a limited time i'm going to throw it out at you and maybe you don't have time to to complete your answer which is fine but i'm really curious do would you say there will be a decoupling happening between u.s and china or maybe china in a global market economy um so i think i'd give that a firm yes but if we if by that we mean a direction of change yes i think we'll see i think we'll see the pendulum swing but if we interpret that too strongly as really meaning that these two giant economies will return to a situation where they have relatively few uh economic links no i don't think that will happen unless unless something terrible happens uh so i think it's uh it's a process that yes will will happen and it'll be costly to both sides and and then hopefully we'll reassess thank you and indeed thank you in 2016 you used the expression uh we're joined at the hip and not happy about it on either side that we have this interconnectedness and that the complementary aspects of each other's economy were starting to disappear and competition was indeed becoming the rule of the new road uh friends i hope that wherever you are uh that you'll join non and i in thanking barry for a wonderful chapter for a terrific presentation
ZtvnA38bpY4,Kirk Denton Looks at Taiwanese Museums,"Prof. Denton discusses his new book, The Landscape of Historical Memory. He explores the place of museums and memorial culture in the contestation over historical memory since martial law ended in Taiwan in 1987. He’ll look at the role of politics—especially political parties—in the establishment, administration, architectural design, and historical narratives of museums. It is framed around the wrangling between the “blue camp” (the Nationalist Party, or KMT, and its supporters) and the “green camp” (Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, and its supporters) over what facets of the past should be remembered and how they should be displayed in a broad range of museums and memorial spaces. The case of Taiwan museums tells us much about Cold War politics and its legacy in East Asia; the role of culture, history, and memory in shaping identities in the “postcolonial” landscape of Taiwan; the politics of historical memory in an emergent democracy, especially in counterpoint to the politics of museums in the People’s Republic of China, which continues to be an authoritarian single party state; and the place of museums in a neoliberal economic climate.

Kirk Denton 邓腾克 is professor of Chinese literature at Ohio State University. He studied at Colby College and the University of Toronto. For more than twenty years he has edited the journal Modern Chinese Literature and Culture and oversaw the rich collection of materials at the MCLC Resource Center. Prof. Denton wrote The Problematic of Self in Modern Chinese Literature: Hu Feng and Lu Ling and Exhibiting the Past: Historical Memory and the Politics of Museums in Postsocialist China. His edited volumes include Modern Chinese Literary Thought: Writings on Literature, 1893-1945, China: A Traveler’s Literary Companion, The Columbia Companion to Modern Chinese Literature and Jottings under Lamplight: Lu Xun.",1,we are going to be looking now at museums and all of us of course uh go to museums some of us are fanatical about it we we love to visit museums but we're going to be looking at museums in taiwan what is the purpose of particular museums who sets the agenda what is included what isn't who decides what is the process what if exhibits need to change who changes them and how do they change what should be represented now we in the united states of course are familiar with our own national museums the smithsonian is of course this sprawling enterprise with 20 museums plus a zoo and sometimes we describe it as the nation's attic and i've always thought that that description was woefully inadequate because things get put up into the attic when you don't know what to do with them and in fact in the museums everything is carefully chosen everything is part of a story that someone wants to tell and sometimes of course this is quite controversial as it was in 1994 1995 when the smithsonian museum planned an exhibition on enola gay the plane that delivered the atomic bomb to hiroshima in 1945. that became quite controversial a lot of fighting about what that story should be what should be included what should be emphasized of course the museum recently a few years ago announced that it was going to expand dramatically but earlier this year ratcheted that back a little bit so we have direct experience with some of these issues now we're extremely fortunate to have uh professor denton with us today he is just out with this book the landscape of historical memory the politics of museums and memorial culture in post-martial law taiwan the book is published by the university of hong kong press and you can go ahead and order it today professor denton taught at the ohio state university for quite some time from 1988 until his retirement just this spring in 2021 he is a distinguished scholar of chinese literature his studies included time in shanghai at fudon university and also at the taipei language institute so he has studied in universities on both sides of the taiwan strait his research has been primarily focused on republican era literature and he's taught a wide variety of courses including those on film on literature in taiwan and in china and has contributed mightily as an uh as a an academic leader as the editor for modern chinese literature and culture a journal that in addition to being a print publication also has this huge online component all sorts of resources are available there and a widely read blog discussion list that you too should take advantage of professor denton's books include works on modern uh chinese literary thought as well as things like a china a traveler's literary companion he has written extensively on people like lu shun on hufang on a whole host of important figures he's examined literary criticism in china at great at great length he is a remarkable scholar and we're so fortunate to have him with us today this new book on the museums of post-martial law taiwan is a great complement to an earlier study that he published in 2014 looking at museums in the people's republic of china that book exhibiting the past historical memory and the politics of museums in post-socialist china is a terrific read and i really recommend uh that you spend time with it as well as his new book in both of these books he takes a very broad look at these museums and tries to look at the different goals that the museums seem to have not just in listening to what people say about them but in actually looking at the exhibits looking at what is conveyed and trying to assess how it is received friends thank you so much for joining us we are so happy that you're with us and now we turn to professor kirk denton of ohio state university what i'm going to do today first of all is uh present very briefly a kind of overview of my first book on museums that deal with post that post socialist china uh and then i'll turn to uh the more recent book and the bulk of the presentation will be about museums in taiwan uh first with a kind of overview of some trends that i find in musiology and exhibitionary culture in taiwan since 1987 and then i'll home in on one particular museum and that's the national museum of taiwan history which is down in tainan in southern china so let me get rid of things here so my work on taiwan museums is actually an outgrowth of my first museum book which is on museums in post-socialist china and in this first book you can see the table of contents on the screen here i look at the politics behind historical representation in a variety of museum types and how they represe how these representations have changed since the mao uh and early post mile era so conventional mauera museum uh narratives continue to exist in some exhibitionary contexts but in others we find radically new narratives so i'll just give a few examples of some of the the new things that we find in in museums in post-socialist china first new representations of late qing and republican era modernization and commercial life that lay a kind of historical foundation for the market economy of the post-socialist present second the commodification of revolutionary history through what is called red tourism third the glorification of local cultures as a reflection both of nativist consciousness and the multi-ethnic nation state fourth martyrdom is an emotional hook for forging national unity in a splintered social environment fifth nostalgic modes of remembrance that elide historical trauma sixth the re-emergence of traditionalism including strong connections with the imperial past and the confucian social and ethical tradition and finally the uses of victimization and trauma particularly with respect to japanese imperialism as a vehicle for shared national sentiment so my focus in this book is on the role of the state in shaping historical narratives through state-funded museums in in the prc almost all not all but most museums are state funded and i by this by doing so i don't mean to suggest that the state has a kind of monopoly over historical memory in the prc clearly if you go online read works of fiction see uh films from china there are plenty of what might be called alternate alternative quote-unquote historical memories but i don't think we should over emphasize these alternative memories to the neglect of the role of the state in forging official narratives whether in autocratic or democratic societies people tend to accept prevailing narratives not because they are unthinking or passive but because their personal identities subjectivities economic well-being and dreams are intertwined with those narratives so we fail to understand china in its fullness if we neglect these official historical narratives and their power to persuade but my focus on the talk today will be my new book on the politics of museums in taiwan as you can see from the table of contents my approach to both books is quite similar and is equally political i'm concerned with the politics behind historical representation in museums most of which are state funded in the case of the prc that politics is driven by a single political party in post-martial law taiwan it is driven by two main political parties the kmt al also often called the gomindang or the nationalists and the dpp the democratic progressive party i'll be using the abbreviations just for simplicity's sake so this book also takes a somewhat comparative perspective on exhibitionary culture in taiwan and china so periodically through the book i'll make references to things going on in the mainland and comparing and contrasting uh the taiwan situation with the mainland situation so before we get into taiwan museums a little bit of historical background on taiwan history since the 1970s taiwan has experienced a dramatic political transformation from a single-party dictatorship under the kmt to a multi-party democracy like the post-moral liberalization on the mainland this transformation was spawned by a death in the case of taiwan the death of zhang kai-shek in 1975. zhang jinguo who is sheikh's son initiated the political reforms which recognized what are called dong wai political elements that is political groups outside of the kmt uh and ended martial law then in the 1990s president lianghue ushered in reforms that led to the first ever presidential election in 1996 and to the election of the opposition dpp in 2000 and to the thriving multi-party democracy taiwan now has so history and historical memory have been particularly sensitive topics in post-martial law taiwan during its single-party rule over taiwan from 1947 to 1987 the kmt sought to control the representation of history it suppressed local taiwan history and upheld a cynocentric view of the past a cultural policy that served the kmt's political platform that taiwan was part of china and that the kmt had an in-abstentia dominion over the mainland over the mainland in the kmt cultural rhetoric and policy taiwan was also the bastion for the preservation of traditional culture traditional chinese culture which was from their perspective being destroyed on the mainland and taiwan's culture and history were ignored or radically downplayed reduced to a history of inter interaction with the mainland of course the kmt also suppressed memory of more recent history including that of the japanese colonial era and the white terror foisted on taiwan from the late 1940s to the late 1970s by the kmt it's itself from the 1950s to the 1980s the kmt propagated its historical and cultural vision in museums and memorial sites particularly in the capital of taipei exhibitions in the 1950s promoted an anti-communist agenda and the nationalist fantasy of restoring the country fuqua typical of museums and memorial sites in the nationalist era were the national history museum established in 1955 the national palace museum established in 1965 the suny hatsen memorial hall established in 1972 and the jankaishek memorial hall established in 1980. these sites present a cynocentric view of chinese history or they contributed to the propagation of the cult of zhang kai-shek or the cult of the kmt more generally with the political liberalization of the 1980s many intellectuals writers and political figures started questioning the kmt narratives of the past and the kmt monopoly on the meaning of that past the taiwan nativist bantu movement of the early 1980s suggested there was a uniquely taiwanese subjectivity to juuti that was an accumulation of taiwan's particular history of multiple occupations and colonization they called for desensitization that is the decoupling of taiwan's history and identity from china and for the promotion of taiwan's own history and culture as a product of these nativist trends since the 1990s new museums and new kinds of museum exhibitions gradually appeared to display facets of taiwan's taiwan's history that had been repressed in the martial law era these museums often promoted by the dpp tend to focus on four aspects of taiwan's history number one pre-history that is the history of taiwan prior to written records and well before han chinese immigration to the island number two the history of taiwan's interaction with non-chinese cultures in particular during the dutch and japanese colonial eras number three the trauma and human rights abuses inflicted on taiwan by the nationalists during the jankaishek era particularly the 2-2-8 incident which refers to the february 28 1947 uprising against the can against kmt rule that was violently suppressed by the kmt and the fourth taiwan's aboriginal cultures now let me quickly take a look at examples of each one of these types or trends that i see the most prominent in the pre-history museum category is the national museum of previous pre-history in taidong in southeast china which was established in 2001 in the kmt era taiwan's history was thought to begin only in the ming dynasty in other words the history of taiwan corresponded with the history of han chinese immigration by contrast this museum and other and others like it draw attention to a much earlier history of taiwan's ancient civilizations the museum forges on a historical origins for taiwan an origins that is largely independent from the mainland it suggests that the people of taiwan today are connected to those who lived here in millennia earlier and to the land that gave up the artifacts from these ancient civilizations the museum placard makes this idea of roots to this ancient past explicit and this is the placard that appears in the upper right hand corner of your screen and the placard reads facing the future we treasure the past for without history we have no roots and without roots we have no future the second trend is taiwan's long history of interaction with the world which is stressed in a variety of exhibitionary contexts and let me draw attention to just a couple of those an exhibit called ila formosa the emergence of taiwan on the world scene in the 17th century held at the national palace museum in 2003 marked a radical move for an institution that had always been associated with the display of chinese culture that is the national palace museum had always been in the kind of cyanocentric mode the cover of the catalog for this exhibition which appears in the upper left-hand corner of your screen shows a map of taiwan from the dutch colonial era with taiwan on its side with the east at the top and no man no mainland visible the introduction to the catalog puts taiwan at the center of quote the east asian maritime traffic and stresses the history of taiwan's quote emergence on the world seen unquote the exhibit the exhibit expresses uh expresses a global cultural attitude that is at the heart of taiwan's new self-identity in the post-martial law era in 2005 the national museum of history another bastion of the sinocentric historical narrative mounted a taiwan-related exhibit titled oceanic taiwan a dialogue between the people and the island again the exhibit emphasizes taiwan's history of contact with the world beyond its shores indeed the word oceanic is a central trope in exhibitionary discourse in post-martial law taiwan this reorientation of taiwan away from china and outward toward the ocean and toward the world is embodied in the map on the right which is rather disorienting and it's it's entitled uh huangaj and taiwan so looking at taiwan from a different angle or perspective and you struggle to find actually where taiwan is but here it is here japan up here mainland china over here but this is a very telling visual representation of what i've been talking about the reorientation of taiwan away from mainland china toward the world other museums stressed taiwan's interaction with the world by depicting the japanese colonial era was the period of the birth of taiwanese modernity and even taiwanese consciousness for example in the february 28th memorial hall in taipei which you can see on the left the history of japanese colonialism is presented positively compared to that of the kmt period this is according to scholars a discursive strategy of making the kmt look bad one scholar jeremy taylor has called this pro-colonial historiography and it's part of the process of de-synthesizing taiwan's history and culture by emphasizing the japanese social and cultural influence there this museum of course the february 28th memorial hall in taipei also exemplifies the third trend that i mentioned exposing the wounds and trauma inflicted during the national nationalist era this museum was ushered into being by chantry bien who was at the time dpp mayor of taipei and who would go on to be the first non-kmt leader of taiwan the museum is more than just a testament to the victims of 228 it represents in essence an entire history of taiwan from the japanese colonial period true to retrocession that is when taiwan returned to mainland chinese control in 1945 to the incident itself that is 228 and the history of kmt martial law and the white terror other memorial sites have opened in the past decade or so that focus on human rights abuses under martial law such as the jing-mei human rights culture park on the site of a detention center in taipei for political prisoners obviously during the martial law era the core of this site is the prison which you can see pictured in the upper left the image on the right is the kind of entrance way that's been kind of reshaped to give it a particularly stark look and also the green island human rights culture park where leftists taiwan nativists and dissidents were incarcerated more long-term so many of the people who were imprisoned in the jing-mei site from the previous slide were eventually sent off to green island for a longer term incarceration and then in in 2011 the administrative yen in in taiwan initiated the process of joining the jing-mei site and the green island site together into a new institution that they're calling the national human rights museum um of course when you put the label national in front of a museum it symbolically takes on a lot more power than it might otherwise have had and it gives much more visibility to the two individual memorial sites and allows them to speak more clearly for the nation the final trend of the four that i've outlined is museums and exhibitions that detail the history and cultures of taiwan's aboriginal peoples taiwan has two major museums the shinyan museum of aborigines and the catagolan cultural center both in taipei and two theme parks one near sun moon lake and the other outside of gaucho that are devoted to indigenous peoples since the 1980s aboriginal cultures have been put on display in taiwan in the service of decentrification and the forging of a unique cultural identity for taiwan museums that focus on aboriginal peoples as well as those on the prehistoric origins of taiwan discussed earlier contribute to creating a national imaginary founded on a sense of rootedness in the physical place of taiwan and to the construction of a new identity for taiwan as a multi-ethnic multicultural nation taiyin wen the current president of taiwan announced in 2017 the location of the future quote unquote national museum of taiwan aborigines to be located outside of calzone but this is not projected to open for quite some time i think in 2027 some of these aboriginal museums go as far as to suggest that because of intermarriage between han chinese and aborigines in particular the ping pool tribes a new taiwan ethnicity ethnicity has emerged a placard in the catagolan cultural center exhibit is labeled looking for the shadow of our ping poo brothers and the inscription so you can see the placard in the upper right the inscription reads what is the ping-poo ethnic group where are they who are they the folks saying have a tangshan father not a tangent mother the tongshan means chinese basically in this context uh so have a tongan father not a time mother best reflects the indisputable fact that the taiwan ping po ethnic group has nearly fused into a single blood lineage with the han this kind of discourse is an extreme version of the vision the dpp seeks to display through the four exhibitionary trends i've been uh introducing desensitization historical rootedness in taiwan ethnic diversity and interaction with the world and democratic pluralism and these have contributed to forging forging a unique taiwan identity even as the dpp and taiwan native nativists appropriated exhibitionary spaces for their cultural and political causes the kmt and those sympathetic to its cultural vision have not stood idly by the kmt has sought to tame the excesses of taiwanese cultural consciousness in some museums and memorial sites and to ins assert taiwan's cultural ties to china and downplay the horrors of kmt rule in others in short the struggle over the past in taiwan has become embroiled in the oppositional politics of taiwan's multi-party system and taiwan's two main political parties have both actively used museums and memorial sites to promote their cultural and political agendas this is seen most dramatically in the example of the zhang kai-shek memorial hall it was built at the height of kmt power as a commemoration to taiwan's lincoln so if you've been to this you can't see it here but if you enter the hall here there's a giant statue of a seated uh a seated chiang kai-shek that looks remarkably like lincoln in the lincoln memorial so i call him taiwan's lincoln when the dpp was in power and chandra bien was president dpp politicians co-opted the space and converted it into the taiwan democracy memorial hall which exhibited human rights abuses under the nationalist regime the statue of jankashek remained there but the exhibit was surrounded him a real insult to the kmt uh with the return to power of the kmt in 2008 the original name of the memorial was restored at present now with the dpp in power the status of the memorial is in legal limbo uh though dpp minister of culture joni jin expressed the desire to revamp the exhibits to focus on human rights issues so now i turn to my case study of the national museum of taiwan history in the fall of 2011 not long after beijing unveiled its new national museum of china the national museum of taiwan history celebrated its grand opening in tainan in southern taiwan this is the first museum dedicated to the history of taiwan the idea for the museum can be traced back to 1992 during the lianghui presidency after martial law had been lifted and the kmt's grip on power was loosening however it took more than seven years for a preparatory committee to be formed and almost 20 years for the museum in tainan to finally open to the public suggesting the difficulty of reaching consensus as to what kind of story to tell tainan was chosen as the site because it's historical of its historical importance it was the center of taiwan politics and culture until taipei displayed it in the latter part of the qing dynasty the museum slogan is everyone's museum which tells you something about the museum's desire to appeal to all constituencies and this will become clearer as i go through my analysis of the exhibits so the main exhibit in the museum is called our land our people the story of taiwan the exhibit is divided into seven parts organized in chronological order part one early residence part two encounters with disparate cultures part three chinese migration to taiwan part four territorial societies and plural cultures part five transformations and the new order part six striding toward a diverse democratic society and part seven peering into a new century so these are basically in in chronological order the very first display that one encounters so the the welcoming section is on the first floor and to reach the exhibits themselves you have to go up an escalator to to the second floor so the very first display is a large video screen that captures captures images of people entering the exiting the the escalator and entering the exhibition space on the second floor so if you're really alert you'll see yourself in the screen getting off the escalator and next to the screen there's a a sign or a placard that reads who are the taiwanese this display suggests that everyone whose image appears in the screen including a foreigner a foreign visitor like myself is taiwanese or potentially taiwanese the accompanying placard to the to the video screen reads thus the term taiwanese is a form of self affirmation impossible to define with a particular language or ethnicity all those who identify with and are concerned about taiwan who love and accept taiwan and who wish to live together in this land can declare with a loud voice i am taiwanese the display raises the question of what it means to be taiwanese and who can lay claim to being taiwanese the openness and inclusiveness of the category of taiwanese is unlike anything i've ever ever seen on the mainland where notions of chineseness are a given whereas in some taiwanese nativist discourses in the 1980s the haklo these are immigrants from fujian to taiwan were positioned as uniquely taiwanese this museum takes a post-identity politics view of taiwanese identity that emphasizes not language or ethnicity but rather one's ties to the land and to the and to its culture in this sense it's still strongly nationalist a recurring light motif in the museum is diversity geographical diversity ethnic diversity and cultural diversity part and parcel of the long history of immigration too and multiple occupations of taiwan displays through the exhibit emphasize in positive ways the cultural contributions of the dutch the spanish the chinese and the japanese as well as taiwan's aboriginal peoples the exhibit also shows a tolerance of the multiple ways of looking at taiwan's past this is something you rarely see in mainland chinese museum but its discourse of diversity clearly asserts taiwan as a modern pluralistic nation there is a kind of telos to the museum's narrative that taiwan's cultural diversity leads inevitably to its march toward democracy which is the title of the exhibit's penultimate display the museum's emphasis on ethnic and cultural diversity seems to be part of its positioning of taiwan's national identity in opposition to a quote-unquote decentralized identity for the chinese mainland if the mainland is homogeneously high and has a conservative continental culture and an autocratic state taiwan by contrast is open and inclusive ethnically diverse interconnected with the world and democratic the section on chinese immigration constitutes the largest part of the exhibit so in no way is the museum in some sort of radical de-synthesizing mode and here on the screen here we see a diorama of a chinese merchants arriving in taiwan by boat but the display on the japanese colonial period is the second longest and most detailed part of the exhibit the exhibit does not disregard the japanese military political and cultural control over taiwan which is which it exerted through the power of a local police mapping land surveys household surveys and so on though it could have done much more for example there is no mention of the existence of japanese comfort women's stations in taiwan but on whole on the whole the the exhibit is rather positive in its representation of the colonial era in the text in the upper right placard the final line discusses the dilemma of taiwan toward japanese colonialism it reads on the one hand the people were attracted by aspects of modern western civilization brought by their new ruler on the other hand they suffered from prejudice under colonial administration the taiwanese people thus had a half-century japanese era struggling between resisting injust injustice and embracing the new civilization one of the ways it emphasizes the allure of the taiwanese uh four taiwanese of the western modern lady modernity brought to taiwan by the japanese it is through exhibits like those pictured here which are i think rather nostalgic representations of japanese cultural influence the exhibit on the japanese colonial era contains positive displays on for instance contributions of japanese anthropology which offered the first systematic ethnographic study of taiwan's aboriginal groups modern infrastructures such such as the sun moon lake power plant and the modernization of agricultural production and the refinement of sugar as well as the formation of modern modern health systems and modern education systems the latter of which according to a placard quote opened a window to the world for members of the taiwanese elite who absorbed elements of modern western civilization while developing a specifically taiwanese ideology in this museum the colonial era gave birth to a taiwan identity or a taiwan consciousness there is a large display on the taiwan cultural association and the journal it published taiwan this organization was principally cultural it promoted vernacularization of language and the new literature that was being pushed on the mainland but it also had a political agenda of seeking self-rule for taiwan the cultural and political uh taiwanese consciousness promoted by this organization filtered down to the popular level as well with the appearance of hit taiwanese language songs such as our taiwan and you can see a display here in the lower right hand corner the colonial era is also depicted as the beginning of taiwan democracy because the first elections in taiwan were held then although they were limited in scope rather than a period of oppression japanese colonial colonialization is depicted as the key to the material educational cultural and political modernity of taiwan as well as of the rise of taiwanese consciousness among people a museum educational pamphlet pamphlet for school children poses the interesting question quote if you lived in that era would you choose to accept japanese rule or resist it why but the picture of ethnic diversity and harmony presented them in the museum seems blind to a history of ethnic strife and violence the history of indigenous people's encounter with a parade of outside occupied occupiers has been far from a happy one involving at worst violent suppression campaigns and at best a range of civilizing policies quote unquote ethnic tensions between mainlanders and hawk laws are downplayed and relations between japanese and taiwanese during the colonial colonial era are generally portrayed in positive ways the museum seems to be motivated by a post-identity politics desire for ethnic harmony rather than drawing attention to ethnic conflicts and the traumas it caused it seems to be interested in healing the wounds of the past and forging a notion of unity in diversity and just as the repression of the japanese colonial era is whitewashed so too is the violence of the kmt era downplayed in some other exhibitionary context the 228 incident is the defining historical event in the shaping of a taiwanese identity in consciousness it's holocaust so to speak in the national museum of taiwan history however 228 and other facets of kmt white terror occupy a relatively minor position the 228 incident has just one small display consisting of a single enlarged photograph with two small placards one on the incident itself and the other on the repression that followed that you can see those two placards on the screen here there is no lingering on the trauma or reflecting on the significance of the events to taiwan national consciousness rather than a time of political repression the exhibit on the martial law era conveys a nostalgic feeling in the upper left you will see a recreated classroom with an image of chiang kai-shek and to the right is a placard about military compound culture this tren tun these were military compounds built by the kmt when it came to taiwan in the 1950s to house soldiers and their families in neither exhibit is there any reference to military dictatorship intellectual repression or educational brainwashing to the lower left you can see a photo of a mandarin speech competition which has no mention of the suppression of other chinese dialects under kmt rule the cultural and social pluralism that is the main narrative thread in the exhibit also serves to lay the discursive foundation for a narrative of the emergence of taiwan as a democratic society in the 1980s and 1990s the sixth chapter in the exhibit is called striding toward a diverse democratic society and the exhibit makes an explicit link between taiwan's multicultural history and democracy one display entitled an era in which everyone can have a say shows various groups protesting such things as nuclear power and nuclear waste disposal political oppression and white terror the limiting of academic freedom etc the exhibit is careful not to demonize the kmt for exhibiting for inhibiting the development of democracy in taiwan instead it focuses in a more positive way on the invent the eventual unleashing of democratic forces the museum presents a rosy picture of democratic pluralism and the idea that people's voices matter which may be problematic in the present neoliberal world dominated by entrenched political power and corporate interests social history is at the forefront in a special exhibit called taiwan memories but it is a constant throughout the museum the museum's mission mission statement lists as one of its schools is to construct quote to construct common historical memories for the taiwan people given the multiple political social and ethnic constituencies in taiwan it's no easy task to arrive at common historical memories but in its attempt to do so the museum avoids or downplays memories that serve the interests of one constituency or that makes another look bad in the name of creating a sense of common investment in the national narrative a narrative of diversity leading to democratic pluralism serves the purpose purpose nicely as does a nostalgic mode of representation that downplays historical trauma political repression and ethnic conflict the museum's permanent exhibit seems to avoid the polemical and confrontational approach to his historical memory that characterizes some of the museums and exhibitionary spaces developed during periods of more radical taiwan nativism in the process the past becomes a deep traumatized happier place to visit a place of ethnic and cultural harmony the museum's does not rile up ethnic differences so much as it seeks to harmonize them in a multicultural mosaic umicha the first director of the museum himself acknowledges that the museum presents a quote-unquote consensus view of taiwan's past so it is less a challenge to conventional modes of historical representation than it is an accommodation of the interests of different groups within a common narrative of striving for democratic pluralism so with that i bring my talk to an end that was a wonderful presentation of an excellent book i've had the good fortune to read the book and i heartily recommend that others get it and read it we put up some links in the chat earlier i want to encourage folks to submit questions using the q a button we've received one just now and we encourage others to submit i found this presentation really interesting for a lot of reasons i particularly where you ended the notion of constructing common memories right that these are created uh they are manufactured rather than leaving it to chance what people hold on to and so uh is the national museum of taiwanese history is this uh the search for a usable past i use what do you mean by usable a usable past i was hoping you were going to fill that in uh in it what i take away from the book and from your talk is that there has been a deliberate effort and this museum was a long time in coming a deliberate effort to move beyond the identity politics that animated earlier decades and to embrace where taiwan is today and where most taiwanese want to go tomorrow and so maybe you could say something about how this representation of the past serves those needs right yeah it was one of the things that i say in the epilogue to my book is that you you you see in recent times a kind of convergence of um ideas that we had previously seen as belonging to either the kmt camp or the tpp camp there's a kind of convergence that's this taken place so that that these two political parties have come to share many of the things that i've been talking about in this in this presentation so it's it's uh part of the political transformation of taiwan as it's emerging uh as a modern nation nation state quote unquote not to be um provocative um but um and so we see this this kind of convergence in terms of things like with the kmt taiwan is really remarkable in the fact that it is moved from being a a dictatorship uh where the the party that was behind this dictatorship is the party that actually ushered in the process of of uh of um destroying that that that dictatorship and leading taiwan into a multi-party democratic system so over time the kmt has come to accept certain facets of of the narrative of history that was being pushed very hard by the dpp uh things like human rights abuses even a kind of moving away from uh chiang kai-shek um and uh distance dissing itself from from uh the the dictator quote unquote um the use of aboriginal cultures the idea of of a global taiwan and a cosmopolitan taiwan these are all things that were pushed by the dpp initially but that had been accepted by the kmt so in the sense this museum reflects that less intensely political competition over the nature of taiwan history that we see in more recent uh times and in your book uh in the early part of the book you make mention of code switching uh you know this term that we use all the time now in the united states and talking and you talk about the fact that many in taiwan uh absolutely reject a binary uh that you know that you have to be either chinese or taiwanese or just one of those two uh and so maybe you could say something about how that fits into telling a different story in these museums than was once the case you know i think that's right a lot of people in taiwan um i you know i've painted this picture of this intense competition between these two political parties but that doesn't mean that average taiwanese people buy into to that so i mean obviously some do there are fervent supporters of the gpp camp there are fervent supporters of the kmt but a lot of people i think especially young people who reject those um the political pigeon holing and uh they do they reject notions of of identity that is narrowly either taiwanese or chinese however i think since uh events in taiwan and sorry in hong kong have unfolded and recent events like the flybys by the uh the pla in taiwan may change things um and opinion polls in taiwan have shown over time since the 1990s i think a a pretty steady increase of people who identify first and foremost as taiwanese and not as uh and not as chinese so there are some still who identified but that that kind of identification with taiwan and with taini taiwanese national identity i think is something that this taiwan history museum is sort of latching onto and embracing that that constituency that really uh identify very first and foremost and closely with taiwan as a place and as an idea well and you highlight that with uh you know that plaque that says uh if you declare yourself to be taiwanese why not uh you could you you too could be taiwanese if you uh embrace the land embrace the culture embrace the this ethos and so that's that's really quite explicit both in the book and in your your presentation and you mention um in discussing the colonial period uh how the colonial period is treated this pamphlet for school children that ask the question okay if you were there what would you have done how would you have felt why right calling on that sort of thing and although uh you know the vast majority of people don't go to the barricades over these over uh these identity issues we know of course that battles over the history curriculum taught to students is something that you know has you know have have pitched the different sides at each other and these are uh state-sponsored museums for the most part that are putting forward uh an idea and i'm wondering if you could say something more about how the museums fit into taiwan are uh how are they integrated how heavily visited who who goes to these museums right um well if you take the national museum of taiwan history as an example it's very from i don't have statistics on hand but in my experience in my multiple visits there it's heavily visited and extremely popular now this you could say this is true of uh some museums on mainland china but many museums especially the highly political ones that promote you know a narrow ccp agenda they tend to not be highly visited so this when when the national museum of taiwan history calls itself taja bogo and everyone's museum i think people really buy into that and really feel that it's it's it's their museum and the museum made this is another stark different difference between mainland chinese museums and taiwan museums is that taiwan museums tend to be much more oriented toward the community first of all in their exhibits their their exhibits are centered around social history rather than political history which is the norm in mainland china but also in terms of outreach to the community and involving the community in donating artifacts to the museum even contributing ideas to the museum so there's this very strong sense of community orientation that is pretty lacking in my experience in museums on the main line and marks a an important difference in taiwan museum culture yeah you you draw some similarities in the two books about you know to top-down kind of initiation but as you've just highlighted a very different ethos this uh community ownership community participation in taiwan one of the things and we're going to switch to some questions from the audience uh in just a moment but one of the things that really comes through in the book and in your presentation is this question of trauma and victim because as you note in uh your earlier book uh depicting china as being victimized by others is the theme in several in several museums and here in the national museum of taiwan history uh that's downplayed you certainly have occupiers but you don't have this sense of victim of loss of suffering uh you're emphasizing the d trauma now you certainly have separate museums and and parks and memorial halls and things like that uh to you know february 28th 228 and those sorts of things but in this museum it it seems as though it the past has all these different threads it's a wonderful mosaic and it was a process largely without suffering and maybe you could say something more about that and why that is so important right um so first of all they talk about the this interesting phenomenon in taiwan one might expect because the kmt was arguably more forceful in its battles against the japanese during the second world war than the communists were one might expect in taiwan to see a a museum dedicated to the war of resistance on the knt's efforts in it there is a military history museum that has a section on that but nobody goes to that museum uh it's it's empty as far as i can see um but there there were plans to develop a kind of a national memorial in the old um sunyat sen um it's called the junghan town which is was the site where it's an old japanese colonial era building but it was used in 1945 for the retro session ceremonies the kmt presided over this ceremony and people in the kmt camp were promoting turning this museum into a war resistance museum but the dpp camp has stymied those efforts step by step and i read just actually this morning in 2019 there was a protest led by a group of radic radical independent taiwan independence groups that uh led a protest directly in front of this hall as a way of suggesting that any effort to connect taiwan's history with the history of the mainland who was a bad thing and shouldn't be happen now um back to the question of victimization there is attention to victimization especially from the dpp camp but it's oriented not toward japanese colonialism but rather toward the knt itself and the taiwanese people as victims of white white terror so it certainly exists this museum the national museum of taiwan history as attempt as sought i think very self-consciously to avoid the extremes of the kind of victimization narrative that you see in other places like the taipei 228 memorial uh hall so victimization i think every country has a sort of victimization narrative um it's it's there uh but it's uh it's it's different in uh in nature and orientation from that we find on the main line well in in the book you highlight uh you know with the the guam dong coming to power in taiwan after uh the defeat of japan uh an effort to you know to have this cyanocentric uh history be taught and to remove japanese influences and you you go on at at you know through more than one chapter on this subject and so that is really uh quite striking because then we get these other museums that are adding telling different kinds of stories and as you say the the japanese portion as told in the national museum of taiwan history is about uh modernity it's about achievements it's about having the machines and the connection to this modern world and these sorts of things and it's not about uh you know forcing the language on people it's not about restrictions about you know what what you can do and say it's not about some of those things the pitched battles uh that were fought in many places with uh indigenous peoples and things like that so that's that's excluded and so one question is um if if those things aren't part of the narrative if those uh you know those aspects of the of the past are not told uh is the this simply because those in power today say let bygones be bygones japan is a nice country we want it on our side that sort of thing yeah i mean if we're comparing the main line with taiwan we have to keep in mind that the historical situation of japanese colonialism in taiwan is completely different from this situation on the mainland which was you know an invasion uh an extremely violent one that involved you know things like the nanjing massacre and other other forms of atrocity so the historical situation is is not really parallel which partly explains um why um japan comes across quite rosy in this particular picture as for the kmt one of the main reasons why they didn't develop a kind of anti-japanese narrative in exhibitionary spaces in the 1950s or 1960s as we might might expect is that their focus was not on japan it was on the communists and uh you know fighting the cold war so well and this is something in your earlier book that you highlight too about uh the nanjing uh telling stories about uh the japanese invasion of nanjing in in 1937 and how in earlier periods the emphasis on the mainland uh the ccp saw the guamadong as a principle of principle rival and so the focus was there uh you could only have kind of one principle you know an enemy at a time we've got a lot of questions that have come in and let me just see if i can group a few of them together and one raises the question about funding and this is something that you addressed uh you you know there are private museums uh in in taiwan and and uh some of them quite large and substantial but maybe you could say something about uh the mix of museums and the mix of museum hosts people who put forward these ideas and fund museums and also we've got a question about the southern branch of the national palace museum and how does that fit uh and you know of course um chen shui bien while president had a dramatic reopening of the national palace museum in taipei but later we get uh this museum in the southern part of taiwan right uh so in terms of funding so most of the museums that i talk about in the book are are state funded so they're the public funds um but taiwan i guess maybe this is true of all democracies but it it makes me think of the paucity of funds that we have in the us for cultural institutions uh but so taiwan is always struggling to raise funds for cultural institutions like museums so sometimes the public funding is coupled with private foundations that will seek to raise funds to supplement the public funding but one of the reasons why some of these museums like the national museum taiwan history that this is also true of the national museum of taiwan literature takes so long to open and to get established is is related to funding it's not just a question of trying to come up with a a narrative that will please everybody it has to do with the paucity of public funds for cultural institutions uh which is a problem world will why in in the mainland it seems to be endless amounts of money if an official in a city wants to build a museum just snaps his fingers and it happens and it happens really fast that just doesn't take place in taiwan so there's that the question about the southern branch of the national palace museum is interesting the idea i think can be traced to a former head of the national palace museum a guy named who is a dpp sympathetic figure um and so i think he wanted to create this museum in the south is a sort of alternative to the national palace museum in taipei which is solidly in the cyanocentric mode however the tpp was out of power the kmt comes into power and they carry on the project of building this museum so it becomes something quite different than maybe doo jong chung had originally intended and but it's quite interesting i look at this museum in a chapter near the end of the book about the sort of global international orientation of museums in taiwan and this museum is framed quite different from the museum in taipei it's framed around the idea of uh of asia and an asian interaction inter a cultural interaction so by asia meaning japan china yes but also india southeast asia so taiwan so this museum becomes a kind of symbol of taiwan's global orientation and so that's sort of i kind of see it as fitting in with this idea of the cosmopolitan nature of taiwan cultural identity that i've been talking about today and it becomes a kind of manifestation of that the the building is quite remarkable it's a beautiful uh building um and and the polar opposite in architectural style to the national palace museum which you had pictured on the little intro before the presentation started which is done in a kind of pseudo-chinese style so stylistically it's modern and the architecture also has lots of symbolism embedded in it that suggests taiwan's relationship with the world at large and so on yeah so that's kind of how i see that museum fitting into the larger context of music exhibitionary culture more generally in taiwan yeah it is uh you know really quite striking uh the comparison to the museum in taipei which is uh you know it's set against the mountain and it's telling the story about uh a place across the water more than about the place where it actually sits whereas you walk into that southern uh the southern branch and you have a gigantic you know opening with this emphasis on seafaring and all of these connections to places including china but not exclusively china and so that's something uh that you you illustrate in the book and we have a couple of other questions about uh the role of the national palace museum in the decentrification process uh you made some mention of it in in your prepared remarks and you've just made uh comments about the southern branch but i was wondering if you'd like to say uh something more about that yeah well first of all i do i don't focus uh on the national palace museum in my book uh and that's partly because people have written about it quite a lot but mainly because it's a fine arts museum and not really a history museum so in that sense it doesn't it tells a story i guess you could say but it's not a story that that we traditionally think of a kind of chronological narrative so it's a different a museum of a different sort i think but clearly you know it's the most visited museum in taiwan uh it's uh it's where foreigners are always taken first one of the first places you're always taking when you visit taiwan so it's extremely important uh as a as a museum but for various reasons i chose not to to focus on it yeah for good i ain't for very good reasons in part because um in some respects it is the outlier uh you know uh in in this in this look and we have uh additional questions about the palace museum and the the southern branch of it uh but one interesting question that comes up a little bit in your talk because you have uh zhang kai shek uh sitting as lincoln does uh in in washington uh dc and you make some re some reference to that uh the question is are there controversies over monuments in taiwan the way they are the way that they exist in the united states and uh the short answer is of course uh but why don't you give the longer answer yeah short answer is absolutely there's controversy and in particular any monument dedicated to uh chiang kai-shek um there's a group called f-e-t-n from ethnos to nation which is a small or i think radical independent taiwan independence group and they've been responsible for defacing several chiang kai-shek monuments in particular so their their modus operandi is to take red paint and throw it over the image of a sculpture of zhang kai-shek and they've done this in multiple locations including his burial site in a in a place called um not far outside of taipei so there's there's there's that um there's a tsuhu is the place it was a residence of chiang kai-shek a summer residence that he went to when it was hot down in the in the valley in taipei uh so this is where uh his body has been um buried but there's all sorts of controversy about what to do with his body his dying wish was jan kaishak that is was to have his body returned to atuja his native province but that's unlikely to happen the dpp has sought to close uh this uh place where zhang kai-shek's body is buried um by defunding the police that sort of guard the site and so if there are no police there they can't open it um so they did that they did that on a couple of occasions but the kmt has always sort of roared back into the picture and and sought to refund the the police that guard the place so yeah there are all sorts of controversies about monuments and oh so i was going to say that next to this place where john kashuk is buried uh in more recent times there's a park that has been built that is a an accumulation of various zhang kai-shek statues that have been brought to this park from locations around taiwan so as in mainland china with its mild statues taiwan has it had its junkai statues so when people didn't want them anymore so some uh the i think a deputy mayor of the local town in this region uh organized people together to bring these old statues that nobody wanted into this park and created this this almost surreal park that you walk around with all these statues of zhang kai-shek and various poses and one of the statues in this park is on the cover of my my book which is so yes memorials are controversial yeah these monuments and and a garden full of uh john kashek statues is a is a remarkably uh uh different place uh you know in in the notion of relocating them the stories about you know where they were and why they're not there now are all really very interesting right and then people have wondered what the intentions behind this park are i can't help but see it as sort of a parody of the whole jankashek called but the guy who organizes the thing said no it's not that's not my intention at all i see these as works of art and i just wanted to save them from destruction yeah and you know how that fits with the uh yeah there was a brief moment the tujong's uh store at the memorial at the the chiang kai-shek memorial in a promotion of of those sorts of things we have a question from uh tom gold uh you of of course know and tom uh asks about a comparison between how taiwan museums are dealing with the authoritarian past how to talk about that and to contrast that with museums perhaps in eastern europe and elsewhere that have gone from dictatorships to democracies more open societies yeah that's that's uh that's a great question um well obviously there is a within taiwan there is an uh a difference between the dpp camp and the kmd camp over how this authoritarian past gets represented but you know i think it's still it's we have to grapple with the fact that the kmt really has come a long way yes maybe it was like pulling teeth um but they have eventually sort of come around to recognize their authoritarian past and to even accept it um in in places like uh a memorial halls dedicated to two to eight and and so on they continue to resist um the use of the word white terror um which paints them pretty in a pretty negative light um so the two uh sites that have been joined together into the national museum of human rights the jinbei sites and the green islands they went through various periods of whether or not to include the term white terror and when the kmt was in power they removed the term white care terror and and when the dpp was in power they restored it and so on so there is this this continuing kind of contestation between the two political camps over how the authoritarian path should be represented um but the comparative uh perspective in other um in post-socialist european nations is is an interesting one they're thinking of this park of statues right there's a similar one in uh hungary uh that's it's got you know statues from the socialist era that are all sort of brought together there um so there's a there's an interesting kind of parallels that are breaking with the authoritarian past uh russia um you know which is no no longer sort of in the soviet union uh but has yet to kind of i think fully uh grapple with its uh authentic past other eastern european countries clearly have done a a much better job and so there is a something i did not do in the book was to make connections between eastern europe and taiwan but i think their my focus was more on comparing with mainland china which has not gone through the even though we use the term post-socialist for mainland china it hasn't gone through this political transformation that we associate with some post-socialist nations in eastern europe uh so that's it's an interesting thing that i i think i'd like to think more about maybe do some but just to reach your research on yeah it it is an interesting and interesting representation and in addition of course to eastern europe uh the question of how uh south korea talks about its past uh through its through its museums uh a very you know uh your book is just so rich there's so much there and in your presentation you really only uh highlighted a couple aspects but one of the things that leapt out at me both in this book and your earlier book uh is when you looked at literary museums and the point of literary museums what uh they were seeking to accomplish now in the questions we have uh people asking more about art galleries and things like that uh but let me push you in the direction of uh this literary past and and the role that that plays uh in the ubuntu movement and other other questions right yeah so and then one i don't know if this is actually the case but i suspect that the taiwan museum of the national museum of taiwan literature was built as a response to the mainland building its modern chinese literature museum so the taiwan museum wanted to offer a kind of alternative vision of chinese language based literature that is different from that of on the mainland but both museums i think are political in asserting or exploring the literature as a kind of cultural foundation for the nation this this is very explicit in the case of mainland china um but also present in the in the case of the taiwan literature museum the but i see also a parallel between the national museum of taiwan history and the national museum taiwan literature both museums take a kind of inclusive view of what constitutes taiwaneseness or taiwan literature so in the taiwan literature museum it includes literature written in japanese during the colonial colonial era there were chinese writers on mainland china living in manchuria during the war who also wrote in japanese but they i can tell you they would not be included in the mainland chinese museum again the historical situation of mainland china taiwan are very different but it expresses a different kind of attitude so there's a kind of inclusiveness tolerance toward diversity is one of the characteristics of the national museum of taiwan literature it's a really wonderful museum actually that is like the history museum very community oriented has tons of activities um and it's it's just a wonderful museum now just very much and also a very approachable facility too uh you don't have a sense of this is an edifice that uh you know that it's all about the building uh you know that that sort of thing uh now professor denton you've talked uh to us and and given us this wonderful book and uh one of the things that you emphasize is this question of openness and inclusivity inclusivity and i'd like to ask a question about um you you'd say a little bit about the presence of aborigines in in other ethnic minorities could you say something about gender something about the representation of women in these various stories yeah that's uh that's a good you always say it's a good question when you're not quite sure how to answer the question but uh let me turn to the national museum of taiwan literature there there's um i think the the people who are the curators at that museum many of them are western trained they studied at western museums either in the field of literature and museum studies and they're highly sophisticated in terms of theoretical discourses surrounding issues related to literature such as feminism eco-literature and so on so the museum exhibits reflects this kind of academic orientation so that that museum is quite outstanding i think in terms of its attention to women writers the problem that women writers face the issues dealt with in fiction by women writers like uh the young and and others um i have to admit that i didn't think too much about this question and when i was analyzing the history museum it didn't stand out for me as a central focus of the the museum but there's a lot of there because it is this sort of socially or social history as opposed to political history it inevitably involves um families and um and the place of women in society and so on but that was not a focus of my analysis i'm somewhat ashamed to admit well it's a very rich book and i heartily encourage people to to read it uh this you know this particular aspect uh is of course one uh that merits that merits considerable attention but i think that what you've done in bringing us into these museums into their creation and into the kind of of experience that someone visiting these museums has is really quite quite interesting so i'd like to close with a question about museums today uh just you know if i can through my phone through my computer access so many different things how do museums fit in and how do you know how uh you know in terms of budgets and things like that you've already talked about how strained most of these institutions are just to keep the doors open the lights on the exhibits maintained uh are there sufficient efforts to extend the reach of these museums even beyond their specific place yeah i mean taiwan museums are particularly good i think and quite sophisticated in terms of their digital presence um digitizing artifacts obviously but also creating kind of 3d tours you there's a 3d tour you can find online that'll take you step by step through the entire exhibit of the museum that i was talking about today um including you can click one display and a video of that display will actually pop up it's really very sophisticated so it's it's and then also in terms of social media presence and so on taiwan museums are are right there right and with it and i think they see it not as a substitute for the physical museum but as a supplement to the physical museum and they hope that people i i don't think looking at something digitally is the same as experiencing it in person in the physical museum and being able to kind of linger in and in ways in the physical space that you can't really do as well in a digital space no i think that's an excellent point that uh you can't necessarily ask questions of somebody who uh you know is is a staffer or a volunteer in the museum or i am often fascinated by how others react to different things right and uh the stories that parents tell children and uh you know this sort of thing is you know this you know we had this or or you know this is different these kinds of things and so that's an experience one can only get by going uh but during the pandemic with these uh travel restrictions uh you know you we can't readily get to taiwan to visit these museums but we can get to your book and get a sense of it and plan those future trips professor kirk denton thank you for this book thank you for your presentation we're really delighted uh to have had the chance to to share uh some of what you've what you've written about with this audience we are grateful to you and we're grateful for everybody who has joined us today thank you so much we look forward to seeing everybody online thank you and for inviting me and i appreciate all the great questions you

a vital set of issues i'm clayton dube of the usc u.s china institute and we're delighted that today's program is a joint venture with our friends and colleagues at the usc center for transnational law and business today we're looking at innovation and competition policy innovation of course is of critical importance we must innovate if we are to increase productivity uh so that we can address pressing needs of course we all want innovation uh to bring us the the newest the latest uh greater convenience greater flexibility those sorts of things but productivity increases are vital if we want to raise living standards they're vital to address the needs of aging populations and shrinking labor pools and of course they're essential if we're going to address issues of environmental degradation we have to produce using fewer raw materials less energy and we have to make greater use of renewables competition is usually seen as a key driver of innovation and so today we're looking at american and chinese policies and actions regarding innovation and competition recent headlines of course highlight the centrality of these topics there is some common ground in both societies we're worried about the dominance of a few mega corporations there's concern about access to key components and technologies we're worried about how to develop the talent needed how to cultivate recruit this talent can future innovation and competition help us to reduce the inequalities in our societies or will innovation and competition policy uh and and progress further exacerbate that inequality in the us of course there are contentions over uh this government's support for innovation and competition aspects of various spending plans there's worries about appointments to regulatory bodies we have investigations into corporations and whether or not the size and spread of these corporations is good for the united states and of course there's concerns over protecting intellectual property created by american firms by americans in china of course we've seen the headlines alibaba meituan baidu didi and tencent household names have been fined or otherwise sanctioned for running a of various regulatory expectations and we have those kinds of concerns both countries see the other as a key rival in fields that may represent the 21st century's economic and strategic higher ground these are essential topics that we're looking in today and our discussion is going to address them leading the conversation is brian peck who teaches at the usc gold school for law school of law and directs the center for transnational law and business brian has worked in both international business and in government at the federal and state levels he'll introduce our speakers and we'll moderate the discussion brian the floor is yours great thank you very much clay i appreciate that warm introduction and for your setting the stage for our discussion this afternoon or this evening we really appreciate that and we appreciate the collaboration with your institute in our center and putting this program together and look forward to a very robust and interesting discussion our center has focused on innovation in ip and the role that competition policy and antitrust enforcement have in either fostering or hindering innovation and intellectual property rights and so we'll focus on that in our discussion this this afternoon i'm going to introduce each of our panelists individually i'm going to ask them to give some opening brief remarks and observations then we'll get into the moderated discussion and then open up the floor to questions so our first panelist is mark cohen mark is a distinguished senior fellow director and lecturer for asia ip project at the berkeley center for law and technology at uc berkeley law school he has a very long and distinguished career in both government and private sector as one of the leading experts if not the leading expert in the us on china ipr issues mark welcome thank you thank you for joining us we look forward to your expertise uh thank you thank you brian thank you clay it's a pleasure to be with kirty and elizabeth as well so i'm going to give a very brief overview of some of the ip issues particularly some of the ones that uh you may be less familiar with uh because there's plenty of them that are not on the headlines of the newspapers uh i'm gonna just give you kind of four or five central themes just to think about because these are also issues that very clearly affect innovation one is china has a very statist approach to intellectual property now intellectual property is a private property right and most people don't even think of a role the state other than perhaps if you have to go to court or go to customs to enforce your rights uh in china ip is part of state planning there are five year or 15-year ip plans and it's incorporated in a very granular way where china wants to go in technology particularly recently and addressing what china calls bottled neck technology technology controlled by foreign companies and it also has reflected in a second key aspect which is that there's a high level of public enforcement of intellectual property uh as you would expect in a statist approach uh a kind of socialist approach which is the way it's described in the patent law the antitrust law you have a lot of public enforcement you have about 70 times more criminal cases on intellectual property in china than in the united states even though the u.s complains about lack of criminal enforcement we have a very active anti-trust regime we'll be hearing about that later and you have a vast administrative enforcement regime that brings up well over a hundred thousand cases per year including in areas like patents which is probably 50 to 60 000 patent cases per year this is astronomical third point this is a complex regime china has more litigation than ip than the united states indeed i suspect that the rest of the world combined its patent office trademark office is planned for id office you go down the list are larger than everywhere else and in most cases probably larger than the rest of the world combined it's a sophisticated regime people are well trained many of them have phds in the field it's not to be underestimated and this it presents itself as a competitive rival with a high degree of sophistication at least on the law the trade rules etc and i say this because many americans if we had this program 20 years ago would think china has no laws it's a wallace place the judges don't know anything and that kind of underestimation uh uh will only serve to harm you as an academic or as a business official it's a sophisticated machine uh next point i wanna make is about the enforcement environment and just to break this down into a couple of points first of all in general based on published data a foreigner will win litigation in china more often than a chinese entity and more often in many cases than he would win incomparable cases in his home country the win rate if you will on patent litigation for foreigners about three years ago was about 84 this is very very high uh uh yet china also has a low utilization rate foreigners do not litigate much in china in fact foreigners are a relatively small part of the chinese ip environment and we can speculate we could probably have a whole separate program on this topic uh but it's fascinating to observe that currently according to official data foreigners are probably less than one percent of the chinese civil intellectual property docket so this is really uh an unusual and perhaps unhealthy environment the last point i'd like to make and i'm going to make this simply because it's counterintuitive even though it doesn't uh greatly affect uh american enterprises particularly big ones that are concerned about the huge chinese market is that another distinguishing characteristic of china's ip regime and even as this enforcement regime is a uh focus on small enterprises china has more individuals owning paths in a given year applying for patents in a given year then the u.s files patents in total from all places at the u.s patent trademark office uh and it's also true of litigation uh uh that uh uh there's a about a thirty percent cohort of small inventors the final patent cases and there's a big focus on making the system available to the little guy china's utility model system which is kind of a petty patent system is the largest in the world by a long shot and similarly uh uh is intended to facilitate small inventors filing for ip all of this makes the chinese ip environment actually rather different from what you hear in the press and maybe if you think about it a little more trouble uh this is a sophisticated environment uh uh where foreigners can sometimes win but at the same time it seems that when they lose they lose big and i suspect that part of the reason for that is when the state has its finger on its innovation needs you may find that the scales of justice get a little bit distorted but hopefully we'll have more time to talk about that after the next speakers thank you brian thank you very much mark i really appreciate your insights and expertise and peeking in a little bit more in depth and what's going on in china in terms of the ipr's situation over there so appreciate that and look forward to your participation our discussion our next panelist is elizabeth wang she's the executive vice president for compass lexicon which is a global economics consulting firm she specializes in antitrust and ip issues elizabeth welcome thank you many thanks to usc for hosting this important event and special thanks to brian for inviting me to join this distinguished panel it's truly a privilege to me especially to be part of this mark and kirti when i was asked to to talk on this panel i immediately remembered my several talk with mark cohen in the spring of 2017 and we have covered similar issues back then and here are some of the the topics uh back then u.s china competition and collaboration strategies for years ahead here's another one innovation and ip in china what american business need to know so four years four and a half years has passed a lot have happened since then we have the pandemic we had a new administration and we have china us tension increased um but i think it may make sense to revisit some of the principles or from the fundamentals what we were talking four years ago and that may help to facilitate our discussion later in the guided topics so i want to make two point two observations about china the first one is that um china chinese economy as of now similar as four years ago is still in the transition stage from the planned economy to the market economy so what does it mean two things at least one um chinese government agency still have very much a strong flavor of the mindset of planning so we will talk about that much later and it so it makes what in the america the invisible hands the market will work things out that mindset is still many times quite foreign to try and chinese mindset so that's one implication the second implication is that in china there are two very very different group of companies the state-owned enterprises and the private owned companies so you may have heard um and clay mentioned earlier to opening this program the alibaba maitran didi those are private owned companies and you have heard of them quite a bit and there are the state-owned enterprises in the tech space you've probably not heard as much but i'll give you uh some some quick examples they're not in tax base but china mobile and uh china first auto work faw and that's one of the uh the top chinese auto space station enterprise so those two groups are quite different so we need to be aware they're such that they're they're different animals out there the second observation i would like to make is more along the line of the ip issues historically for many years chinese companies entities individuals they are primarily ip users and not really ip creators being ip creators is something relatively new even though it in the last decade also it changed very very fast like mark has mentioned earlier but um this um changes of using ip versus creating ip and that changed the incentive of enforcing or protecting ipr's significantly i just want to mention that many of the differences we see we need to think about is it truly a china issue or is it just owning creating versus using issue so i want to make those two points um and about the context of the chinese economy and chinese companies and then later when we talk about specific topics it may make sense a lot of discussion where i come from going get back to you brian great thank you very much elizabeth and we certainly look forward and appreciate your perspective from the china side and our discussions later on during the program our third panelist is kirti gupta kirti is the vice president for technology and economic strategy at qualcomm incorporated where she and her team provide economic analysis and thought leadership on global technology intellectual property and anti-trust economic policy issues she's a very seasoned economist engineer and industry expert with around 20 years of fortune 500 companies so kierti very well welcome it's great to have you with us and we look forward to your opening observations thank you brian and everybody else at team usc cleaning this up i think it's a really timely event we're obviously here today because you know we're in a technological race with china um and i would like to just start this conversation from the point of view of wireless technologies that is what we do at qualcomm uh we've been transforming the world with wireless technologies over 30 years and i would you know bring it back to the innovation economy and the ip trends that we're talking about um look i mean with every generation of wireless g i think there has been sort of this major shift in the industry and now there are more uh mobile subscriptions today than people on the planet that has been the wireless revolution but right now we are at the cusp of this technology we call 5g uh fifth generation g or 5g that i think is a paradigm shift it's different from other generations or g's in the world in the sense in the past in the sense that it isn't just about connecting people it's about connecting everything everywhere from your smart homes to smart cities enterprises cars uh hospitals uh in in that way it is the universal fabric of connectivity the infrastructure of our future connected world if you will and you know when clay was giving this talk about innovation is the key to driving economic growth i think 5g is coming at such an important time in the world because it it it's exactly that kind of general purpose technology that we need right now you know economists have been concerned about innovation being on the slow down productivity being on the slow down over the last half century because it's as if those kinds of technologies that create that multiplier effect you know are few and far between but 5g is one of them it transforms industries so why am i talking about this in a you know panel on us in china because from 1g to 4g you know these kinds of foundational critical technologies have been developed in global standards 5g is same thing is happening 6g same thing is going to happen and we've seen an increasing rise in participation from china investment from china to be sure you know governments around the world understand the importance of these critical technologies you know from uh us eu china india japan vietnam everybody recognizes the importance of leading in 5g having that 5g competence as a part of their tech sovereignty program but right now when it comes to going to the standards bodies where rubber meets the road let me just share with you you know this is a real uh technological arms race there's a real competition the us is in the lead right now eu is in the lead right now as it has been for 1g to 4g standards but that leadership is ours to lose if you're not careful and i think we you know being careful is important right now because uh although we understand the importance of leadership in these technologies that's you know understood by this administration it's understood by the previous administration it's written in you know the recent executive order of uh president biden on promoting competition in the united states you know exactly at the same time we are missing some important pillars that enable leadership in these kinds of critical technologies not just 5g but other emerging technologies and that is intellectual property how is all this innovation happening you know i think elizabeth you pointed out you know we there's sort of this kind of a different mechanism in which innovation happens in different economic structures we have been living in this economic structure where innovation happens based on a market-based economy we need returns on investment we are not you know companies like ours aren't depending on state subsidies or some kind of big government grants we are depending on returns from the market so what we do is you know we invest over 20 percent of our revenues back in r d every year and uh that enables us to take very risky long term bets 10 years 12 years 15 years in advance before you think of hear about the next g the tinkering in the lab has already begun and some of those risks are uh those that don't uh become successful others become successful but if they do we can then broadly license intellectual property patents and get some return on the investment for those early risky bets and then continue to basically the cycle of investment if that virtuous cycle is broken you can't really reconstruct it back there is it's a kind of a one-way slippery slope for losing leadership in these sort of critical technologies that develop over generations so i think if we don't understand that ip is the linchpin to driving competitiveness driving technology leadership in very important technology areas like 5g and many others that leadership is ours to lose i hope we can continue this discussion um as the panel progresses great thank you very much kiriti appreciate your comments and observations and we will appreciate your perspective of these discussions from your technology and policy and business expertise so thank you for that and actually you segue into our first question with your opening remarks caret and that is um you know is is the us at risk in losing his leadership in innovation and competitiveness in tech sectors to china or has it already lost its competitiveness in certain areas at least maybe charity if you want to pick up from what you started with your opening remarks yeah so i i think what we're seeing is you know real as real um investment in effort from china across various kinds of technology standards and i'm sure you know others can remark in other technologies leading you know starting from 5g to ai video codecs connected cars a whole range um there's a difference between quality and quantity and i think elizabeth was alluding to that there's still sort of this you know currently china net net tech user not ip user not ip creator um at least that's what we are seeing in the data i think that's that's true uh but again given the level of investment i would ring some real alarm bells about ensuring that we preserve some important pillars that have led to this leadership until now and don't eviscerate them for specific concerns that can be addressed in a more surgical manner i from what i see i see two areas where um china has advantage uh over u.s at this moment in the tax space number one chinese china is really good in scale things up and mass production in the sense that um it can get things um cheaper faster and and and bigger in general so so that that's one area and second area is the social driven ai driven business model and surrounding technologies so two examples there um clay mentioned mate 1 earlier i don't know whether any of you are familiar with that it is a food a delivery app it's very popular in china i have used that versus um door dash and other things it it's it's miles miles difference in china you can order food from tens of thousands of restaurants 2 a.m in the morning it will deliver within 30 minutes and the charge of that delivery is like a dollar more and compare that with what i see in the us usually they take an hour and it charge extra 10 bucks for order of 20 dollars and they limit the choice of restaurants in that in in that network it's it's really um uh a proportion not not even worth mentioning so another example social media we know about tick tock or if we i watch a show on netflix i can see this uh if the social feature of the show in china there's something called tamu i know mark you can understand what i'm saying it meaningless user can do real-time comment on the show that's broadcasting and saying oh i love this smile this actress just did or i there's something that's so funny about this and there's so many of the user content can be can appear on uh when you're streaming immediately and that's such a popular thing in china i'm just saying that there are many area um that's the user interaction the user feedback is incorporated in the um in the platform it's so much faster and more instantaneous than what i see from the u.s counterparts um so from from that perspective um there are advantages what i see but i want to remind something else from the economic basic concept which is during international trade different country or different company having their comparative advantage the key word is comparative advantage not advantage per se is comparative so um different country or different company are good at something uh not so good at other things it's just normal uh competition uh with different perspective and i just want to make sure we don't lose sight and seeing somebody else is doing it is better in something and that's necessarily something alarming that to you brian thank you elizabeth mark any additional comments on that yeah um i'd like to kind of rip off of where cartie left off because there are a number of kind of uh sub points uh to her message um you have a huge amount of patenting a high amount of quantitative activity in china and and to read the press and the west uh we're going to be inundated or we already are inundated by china out innovating us because china has so many more patents or scientific publications or phds or scientific institutions or any number of other things and um uh and it is true china has all those things that doesn't mean it's a qualitative advantage and that also doesn't mean that it isn't valuable in the game of international ip litigation or in getting a judgment in china regarding the value of your portfolio or in making it very difficult for a foreign country to enter the chinese market when you have a huge basket of patents that you're threatening to assert uh and i think part of the problem with the west is we have what is now a very uh uh aggregated view uh a very non-granular view of uh what is happening in china i read an article the other day china threatens to dominate the world in a ipads well ai is a basket of technology and the article was all about facial recognition technology now china dominates in facial recognition technology in fact companies like facebook are pulling out of that technology because of privacy concerns but for china this is a security and police issue that's not necessarily the direction the united states is heading but you have to disaggregate it and say what is important to us and are we losing out in those areas it's also really important when you look at what china's doing to reflect on things like our five-year plan our ministry of science and technology our talent program we have none of those zero uh and china has those in abundance at a national and local level and that is really what is feeding into these developments and not only that i think equally important for purposes of this discussion is that they have officials who really understand these issues you know uh when i was in the government uh the second time around and i met with secretary pritzker and i had my five-minute elevator speech with her and i was thought very long and hard about what i was going to say to her as secretary of commerce about the chinese idea regime and i said imagine adam secretary that you called up mayor bloomberg who was then mayor at the time of new york and he said mr mayor i'm unhappy because new york only has 3.0 patents for 10 000 people and the national goal is 3.3 and secretary pritzker looked at me and said why the hell would i say that i said because if you don't understand that that that is happening on a daily basis and people are getting promoted on that basis and companies are moving through the bureaucratic system the high-level jobs the ceos and state-owned enterprises are getting recognized if you don't understand about how deeply that goes into china's system that ip is now fully incorporated into its economic system which has a tendency to create junk when the state gets involved then you you don't have a fair understanding of what's going on we're not going to be overwhelmed by uh chinese patents if we understand where the quality is where the gold is and where the lead is but if we don't understand that we're going to live in fear and have really hard time a very hard time engaging china and in a way that protects our interests thank you um let's move on to the next question and that is what are the differences between the us and china and their approach of both their respective private sectors and governments towards strengthening their competitiveness and innovation and as a follow-up to that you i think you've touched on this a little bit already and some of your comments to the first question is how economic nationalism either help or hinder advances in both countries i would gently uh defer on the point that you know uh comparative advantage yes of course that's a great thing but i think the underlying approach to innovation is so different that it's really not an apples to apples comparison so what is the key difference in the us and china approach look you know china has let's talk about standards a 2035 standards plan a comprehensive innovation policy comprehensive policy on intellectual property we have none of those things you know in our own executive order on competition let me just go back to that as an example there is this whole paragraph about recognizing the importance of leadership in critical technologies areas standards like 5g and exactly in that same document there is some reference to hey let's you know make sure that we regulate intellectual property especially in the case of standards but two don't add up so there is no coherence in terms of policy that we are promulgating to reach our overarching objectives i think that's sort of you know one-on-one difference in approach the other difference in approach is obviously you know market driven versus you know we like i think i've already shared in this discussion brian that you know we live in a market-based economy we're waiting and repair we're entirely dependent on returns on investment from the market not on anything else to be able to invest and innovate and that's how the innovation agenda is set it is set based on what the consumers want what's going to sell in the marketplace not on other you know bases that are more centralized in nature or driven by a sort of a overarching you know central planner agenda i think it's really important that we stay true to that so you know to the extent that we are now facing concerns in the any trust ip community about you know big tech platforms about um concentration of markets some of those concerns are absolutely valid but are the tools that we are approaching to address those concerns valid i don't know we gotta take a hard look at are we undermining our overarching goals i i just might add uh again to kurdy's comments that um you know if you look at ip as one important aspect of this discussion obviously we have yet to appoint the uspto director so we're a year into a four-year administration a quarter of the term of biden has gone by we've had uh policies of the wto coven 19 we've had this white house directly on competition we've something new going on standards and the one person who lives and breathes intellectual property uh uh who could add something not only to those domestic issues but also to the u.s china trade war has not yet been appointed hopefully she's going to have hearings tomorrow but um uh policy is already set without the benefit of information or expert information uh uh as we don't you know what do we have we're i said it jokingly where is that science and technology oh we have an office of science and technology policy in the white house very thinly staffed uh uh and we really don't have um uh the folks who are looking at civil technology if you go to dod you'll find there's a lot of people following security issues but the the civil technology and uh the very close gap uh that now exists between um civil and and security issues uh we're aware of it but we really don't have the people who understand how technology works and frankly the delay in appointing a pto director is a very good indicator of that another indicator by the way is at the same time as the u.s was weakening patent protection through supreme court decisions on areas like ai software paths genetic inventions the same time almost as if china was saying i see an opportunity china was strengthening those protections uh and it was possible and i believe it still is possible to secure patents in china on technology that you cannot secure in the united states uh uh and that's really i think not because the supreme court which made those decisions was um ill-intentioned but really they didn't understand what the technologies of the future are and no one was really in a position to well advise them on that uh so these are fundamental structural issues uh uh i know brian when you and i were uh serving the government actually a few years later i did a survey of trade officials in usg not just usdr but commerce and other agencies it's around 2008 how many of them spoke chinese and i think there were two and i was one of uh uh so again you know the the language expertise the area studies expertise the technical expertise whether it's economics or stem uh makes it very hard to craft the right kinds of policies and i think they've become especially critical china has cultivated those talents they've been sending them to the best schools like in the us but um uh the u.s has not that's also been uh contributing to our weakness um i i want to um um welcome what kurti just said a little bit earlier that's what she said it was spot on so the difference in my mind between the u.s approach and chinese approach on how to um innovation it's very different approach the chinese approach government planned very focused and pre-selected national champion approach the at least from the government perspective and the u.s if i understand properly is market driven diversified and survival of the fittest type of approach and um so the key question is what is the most efficient way to generate um innovation to allocate limited resources i think that's the economic question and people have answered in the past meaning that in most situations the invisible band slash competition market force whatever you call it is more efficient than government planning to allocate resources to stimulate innovation and fully understand the concern that the government planned pre-select national champion a lot of resources piling on certain companies that may generate some short-term advantage it's possible but in the long run the market driven kurt he mentioned a little bit earlier get the proper right of rate of returns through market competition at least economic thing theory explained to us that's more sustainable sustainable and healthy in the long run and this point has been asked and to me empirical tests in china already that's why i mentioned earlier in china there are two group of companies out there state-owned enterprises versus private private companies and using those example and state-owned enterprises they're planned invested by government in contrast the private companies they're less so on in terms of government planning resource allocation all that stuff so if you look at right now in a tech space which companies are more successful and you heard about tick tock tenzin ali baba huawei those are private companies those are not state-owned enterprises and the economic theory told us the inefficiency caused by the planning and uh the thing that mark mentioned earlier those are very true and out there so the concern of whether the market signal the market competition would lead to best result at least in the long term from inside china already we see it's actually market competition wins out i just want to point that out thank you and i think all of you have really clarified and explained in great detail the key differences between the two approaches between china and the us in terms of market and incentivizing and spurring innovation um and technological advances it seems to me that there could be an argument made that although the u.s may have separate policies as mark pointed out you've got these different policies that have been laid out both domestically and internationally but yet they don't have the leadership to implement them or to develop them more fully it seems to me that the us currently doesn't really have a viable policy to maintain or strengthen its competitiveness in innovation and key tech sectors in your view what would be some concrete uh proposals or solutions that would that the u.s should consider to to strengthen his competitiveness and innovation vis-a-vis china well you know i'll take an initial crack at crack at this although i'm hardly the the leading scholar on u.s innovation policies but let me say the state should not be totally discounted even though we rely on the market and and uh you know darpa uh uh you know inventing the internet uh finding the right balance between the role of the government and industry is um is really critical i'd also like to add another point though on this balance between the state and the private sector and i agree with what elizabeth said about the efficiencies of the market but you know we're uh 20 plus years into china's market reforms and even now in legislation pending before the national people's congress the legislators say we need to accelerate the leading role of the market when china joined the wto the fundamental assumption was that china was going to become a market-oriented economy and in fact uh um and you'll remember this better than me i think brian but in fact and that was the reason we expected that we wouldn't have special treatment under our dumping and countervailing duty laws after a 15 year sunset period china won't need that because the steel industries the heavy state invested sectors will all be run by market forces uh of course no one i think really took seriously the possibility that intellectual property or innovation would also be run by non-market forces or that the patent system would be heavily dependent on subsidies which it has been uh uh uh and what that might mean uh uh uh to the chinese domestic market or how foreigners are treated that was really not under contemplation and this is uh kind of a fundamental contradiction to use a concept used by chairman mao uh between what the western expectation was of china's economy at what china has been and more recently has reinforced which is really an important leading role the state and of the party and in particularly in the past two to three years we've seen the party come out even more directly and openly to champion innovation policies to champion state intervention and the like and that is uh on the one hand at least that's a little bit more transparent but on the other hand it's troubling you're not going to have independent courts you're not going to be treated fairly as a foreigner at least there's that tremendous fear and although you know an alibaba or tencent may be privately oriented and uh uh have a certain advantage in the chinese market when it comes to a facebook or a netflix competing in china uh they're gonna be at a major disadvantage against a private champion such as an alibaba attention at least that will be perceived and that will certainly be the case in market access and intellectual property and other areas uh so it's not uh once the state is that deeply involved the way it affects the market is multi-fault uh uh and sometimes unseen uh uh uh and that makes it very very difficult i think for companies to fairly monetize their ip rights in china or to have a sense that they'll be treated fairly they may have a greater fear than is the reality but i can't even tell you that for certain because it's not a transparent system and when you have a non-transparent system where a very large cohort for example cases are not published then you naturally suspect that it's those unpublished cases those decisions behind closed doors that are the ones that really matter not the ones that are made available to the public do you have some thoughts on some perhaps some concrete solutions or at least proposals that the us government should consider you know uh from uh from from the perspective of um technology ipn standards i think that it would we've got to have a comprehensive innovation policy and we've got to have a comprehensive policy on standards when it comes to ip antitrust these are legal tools and they should be incorporated i mean they should be used to advance the agenda of innovation policy of technology policy not the other way around they are the tools that need to be used towards reaching the goals and not determine where we need to reach so you know let me let me just make this a little bit more concrete for example if we have a comprehensive innovation policy that says we must lead in you know 5g ai semiconductor supply chain these are the five steps we need to take part of which could be let's talk about standards you know if we need to lead in 5g standards we must ensure number one a strong intellectual property pillar because if you know u.s companies don't have a way to invest in these technologies they will not go to these standards bodies and they will not lead in them period second we must advance a rules-based ecosystem so that we play on a level playing field with china with others in a global standard setting agents in in global standard setting institutions uh we must make sure that the you know governance principles are strong that everybody is playing by the rules of openness transparency fairness consensus building majority clarify what those rules are so that nobody can game the system we must ensure that standards should be global and there is multilateral cooperation to ensure that they are global so that state-driven innovation agendas cannot you know rule the day then you talk about okay where does it fit in where does any trust fit in but right now i think we don't have a comprehensive innovation policy we don't have a comprehensive standards policy we have things like you know uh an executive order on some something that's relates to any trust and we talk about innovation policy in that context it's the other way around thanks security um elizabeth what do you in your thoughts um on what are the key factors for u.s competitiveness and innovation vis-a-vis china what would be some of the key factors for the u.s to consider or you know again from the chinese perspective um i think this the the strongest factor that would make america great not again american great to begin with is is this um it's mature and efficient market that's open and fair and efficient in both physical capital and human capital and um my i came from china my american dream is that i can come to us compete on merit and it doesn't matter where i come from who i know and who i associate with and to me my favorite tv show is the shark tank and where it's such a beautiful illustration what a efficient and the mature market look like and there if something is disrupting that market it's both in terms of human capital as well as physical capital if something is disrupting that i think that's such a such a big loss um to the us and my personal view china doesn't have that if u.s can keep doing that keep maintaining that efficient and uh market force whatever area it put into it going to be great that's just my personal view um i want to pick up something that both kirti and mark have referred to and that is that you know earlier this year president biden issued an executive order to promote or to allegedly promote competition in a wide range of sectors including tech but i think there's been some concern among certain technology companies about how effective or how much of a hindrance this might be um what impact will this executive over have on us leadership in innovation as competitiveness in key tech sectors kierti sure i i can start i think uh you know frankly the purpose of the executive order seems to have been concerns vis-a-vis big tech platforms um the you know fangs or the gaffer companies as we call them uh apart from you know this coming out of context without having an innovation policy that this is somehow supporting or not um i think that you know that there are some significant causes of concern we should flag um and they relate to this sort of st it's woven in uh at several points in the executive order that we should be limiting intellectual property rights access to them their enforcement or enhancing the regulation of ip in areas like standards or drugs or agriculture um in different parts of the executive order and that's somehow meant to promote competition and i think that's a significant cause of concern because uh you know the ip community of small inventors entrepreneurs venture capitalists universities they have spoken up again and again and again in support of intellectual property rights because that is the only way they have to protect their ideas traditionally it's the fangs or the gaffa companies the big tech platforms that you know the executive order has a beef with they're the ones who benefit from weakening intellectual property rights that the executive order is trying to do so it's a little confusing why you know this policy directive that is trying to rein in the power of the big is actually giving them a gift the big have other ways to protect their ideas and that's why they don't like ip they don't like the idea of having you know this process of shampooing process of creative destruction where good ideas can come from anywhere and it can threaten the status quo they have means of vertical integration they have means of you know prioritizing their ideas and a first mover advantage they have you know monetization of their ideas for adjacent markets cognominate effects all kinds of means to be able to protect their ideas that the small don't and that's why the smaller you know the nvca has written papers most recently about their concerns with these kinds of proposals the national venture capitalist association the the mentor community has written their you know papers in uh with concerns about these kinds of proposals so you know the it's the small guys it's the innovators that are really concerned about weakening of intellectual property rights because that is leading us to exactly the system where only the big will have the privilege to innovate and in that system by the way we're only the big the vertically integrated have the privilege to innovate the state-driven economies have a natural advantage i i find myself uh speaking on kirti's coattails but uh uh that's okay i i the um [Music] i i i i curry makes some very important points and and i think uh uh it's actually an area that's often neglected in the united states about how our innovation system ecosystem has uh uh kind of neglected the smaller startups uh on the smaller vc firms and the like even though in the back of most people's minds as a thomas edison or hewlett and packard or bill gates that somehow began the garage and made their way to uh becoming multi-billionaires i uh but the reality is we have a system that is highly corporatized uh and where a lot of the big companies view ip is a bit of a nuisance they don't need it that much to maintain maintain their dominance uh uh and in that sense um it it it it's it's a it's a kind of a weakness on the u.s side i i think also the the the biden announcement just to dwell on one small area that was also contradictory was this area of non-compete agreements they they wanted the ftc to investigate uh the anti-competitive effect of non-compete agreements the idea being that uh you know full labor mobility will make a more competitive economy which is exactly the law in california where non-compete agreements are generally illegal uh the problem with that is if you have an employee uh who goes and leaves their employer let's say a california company today taking trade secrets and goes to china for example uh uh and the non-compete is ineffective you have no way other than bringing a great secret case to pursue that individual and those types of cases have happened in california in the semiconductor sector in particular uh uh so it's again a bit of a of a blindness or deafness regarding the international uh implications of uh weakening the ip system of weakening uh our system with regard to non-competes of ramping up against some of our competitive companies using antitrust where occasionally it might be inappropriate but uh uh that um we're not looking at the international consequences uh i also you don't mind i wanted to debbie seligson raise some questions online and if i can i just want to somewhat related to this uh she asked uh uh she thought that i was being perhaps too black and white and describing the us's market-oriented and china as being state-oriented uh after all uh uh all i p rights actually most ip rights not all ip rights are granted by the state but in some cases they're protected by the state but not all ip rights are granted by the state but uh nonetheless copyright subsists without formalities straight secrets are not granted by the state uh but even accepting that premise um uh they're i think our objective indicia of the hand of the state and china that don't exist in the u.s and don't exist even in economies like in europe which do have a more active state role for example until recently most of the ip enforcement in china quantitatively was undertaken by the state uh that is by state administrative agencies uh and to this day the level of criminal enforcement in china as i mentioned earlier is about 60 times the size of of uh the us uh uh also subsidization of patents and trademark filings or participation standards is a status role goals regarding ownership of patents and trademarks for 10 000 people at 10 000 enterprises is a status goal we don't have those things nor nor in fact did china traditionally have strong civil remedies with adequate compensation when qualcomm was the subject of a state-sponsored anti-trust investigation where damages i believe were about 875 million dollars there was roughly 60 000 times average civil damages and a patent lawsuit in china so there you have it when the state is pursuing you 875 million dollars when you bring a private patent lawsuit twenty thousand dollars that's how the state plays out its empty hand where it's enforcing what it wants it piles on the penalties but in order to have a robust civil compensation system where you can protect your rights uh where you can monetize the rights because they're well protected or you have functioning markets that's where china has had to struggle because the state is so actively involved so i do think this is an area where there are shades of gray uh uh uh uh and ip is still basically a property right yes it is true that property rights are dependent upon the state but there are systems that are more private property oriented and many that are less and certainly north korea which by the way has a patent law uh and protects patents and its constitution is probably much less protective of ip as a private property right than china and and the days to quibble over you know property rights and ip and its importance and its merits are over we're talking about a technological arms race we're talking about tools in the toolkit that we need to use one way or another to win the race period that's what this is about so you know we need to have okay what's our innovation agenda lead in these technologies what do we need we need ipv we need this we need that we need these tools okay let's get those tools we can't have technocrats run the show say oh yeah we need to you know put any trust here and devalue ip there and to help with the innovation policy and the broader goals i i just have very small point which is completely different from uh the the the ip perspective and more on the innovation part my reading is probably my very narrow reading of the the executive order is that it appears to me it focus a lot more on distribution rather than uh efficiency issue so um that there are talking about um how anti-trust or competition is to solve the um reallocation of things which in my mind is called distribution and um traditionally competition uh is to promote innovation which is to make the pie bigger rather than focus on how do we slice and dice who get the bigger piece of a given pie so that that's just that's on my house it's right on you know you can talk about rent distribution people about it all day but at the same time you're losing losing the pie to competition no very interesting discussion on that different perspectives much appreciated i know we're running out of time and i know that we've got some several great questions from the audience so let me raise one more question um if i may all of you have stressed the extreme importance of strong intellectual property rights protection and it's key you know role that it plays in terms of spurring and protecting innovation and competitiveness especially the tech sectors you know we hear about we mark you know very clearly outlined the problems and the challenges that companies face in china the current ipr regime there has there been any progress i know it's been mark you know this firsthand more than anybody here you know that this has been a long-standing concern in focus of the u.s yeah has there been any improvement or you know for example there was a phase one trade agreement last year that had certain commitments um is there any improvement in is there sometimes sorry is there what are the key concerns that u.s companies should still be aware of in going into china working in china well i think without a doubt the system has improved so uh i i i i suppose that's the good news the bad news is that the uh the areas of concern are where there's more uh uh uh uh existential uh uh threats like uh the us technological competitiveness we were we were never going to be uh uh uh uh strategically undermined uh by uh counterfeit uh uh you know louis vuitton banks you know or or or or some of the other consumer goods or luxury goods but when it comes to technology and economic espionage anti-trust if it's misapplied and all that it has a much more existential impact upon the us but you know in terms of the functioning of the ip system china has you know specialized ip courts a new national appellate ip court the pat i have to say i teach chinese ib at berkeley and i'm dreading teaching in january because every major ip law has been revised in the last two years the patent law the trademark law the copyright law the trade secret law the anti-trust law is being revised there's a new plant variety law as well as regulations and judicial guidance and cases it is absolutely astronomical and this was done without the pressure of joining the wto this was done largely in response to china's own uh domestic its consideration of its own domestic needs now the phase one agreement brought a lot of positive changes uh increased damages possibilities for punitive damages an increase in criminal enforcement uh some special campaigns and i'm mentioning all those at the outset because those were the easy ones even though people in the us may view it otherwise those are the ones where the state is actively involved this is kind of cohen's hypothesis i'm drilling it in but the reality is china is always interested in improving the state's role and managing ib and that's what we got out of china the phase one agreement in large part do we still have complete transparency of court decisions absolutely not do we know how every case is being decided do we get copies of preliminary injunctions when they're ready rendered absolutely not uh uh uh so some of the other things that go into a functioning civil system and china is a very big civil system over 400 000 cases a year which i guess is probably roughly 40 times the size of the united states we don't have a really good window into it and i think some of the things that have been neglected what i used to call orphaned back in 2004 uh uh uh uh are coming to haunt us we didn't talk about patents with china bilaterally to any great degree until the past five or ten years we hardly talked about trade secrets with china we certainly rarely talked about industrial policy uh uh or commercializing or licensing technology and having a good market for that those were not top grow issues we were concerned about trademark counterfeiting and uh knockoffs of hollywood movies important issues particularly down in los angeles i'm not going to disparage the movie or recording industries but uh the high-tech sector whether it is uh high-tech and 5g and iot or the technology sectors whether it's material science or biotech we're not really front and center in that equation and that's the area that's really really important and demands a much higher level of sophistication uh you know our our farm pan applicants being treated fairly in china there's some data that suggests that where a patent is incorporated into a standard the likelihood that that patent will be granted in china is lower than uh if a chinese applicant apply for that patent or compared to other technologies uh that is really significant information in terms of the kinds of industrial sectors that kerdi works on uh uh uh similarly there's data that says the same thing about biotechnology that foreign biotech farmer patents are being discriminated against in favor of chinese applicants do we know what happens in the courts no no we are 20 years into china's wto accession and for us to still be wondering when are we going to get all the court cases how are we going to determine whether we're being treated fairly is not uh the sign of great success in our trade negotiations we should know more and those issues were not part of the phase one agreement elizabeth i know you focus on ip issues in your work with compass lexicon um any any thoughts or observations about you know how it's improved or what u.s companies should still be wary of right i was remembering back what mark mentioned earlier that the statistics show that um the the the win rate for the patent litigation in china for nine us nine chinese companies is higher on that comment and that actually that statistics i heard from mark four years ago and um i i still remember he said u.s companies go to china and do your litigation and search your right there um and at least from the very little data that i observed which is um similar to what we currently mentioned a little bit earlier this standard essential patterns um litigation in china i do see at least now compared to four years ago more non-chinese companies are getting involved in the litigation in china so that's this little data point um to to for what i observe uh the second observation i see is that i mentioned earlier that um i p protection issue is a china issue or is it um are you the creator versus are you the user of the intellectual property right and um my hypothesis is that if you you are the owner or creator of the intellectual property uh you have more incentive to protect it versus um if you're just purely the user so what i observe is that um chinese companies those are creating or owning intellectual property rights especially patent rights they i see what i see is they start to use patent litigation to protect their petting rights so that general direction if chinese companies owning more patents only more intellectual property right then they should respect or protect iqr more and i do see that moving toward that direction too okay thank you elizabeth kirti we only have a couple minutes but if you wanted to add anything i apologize for that but i'll just add a minute then because i think mark covered a whole bunch of sort of the reality on the ground right like we're still quibbling about where's the data to show whether we're being treated fairly so there's like there's really lack of information but i would say that you know one of the most recent topics of conversation has been the use of an assumed injunctions and an iodization junctions in china to keep jurisprudence in china to keep the global rate setting in the context of standard essential patents and trend rates in china so look there's a game to be played here and it's play it's being played well uh by by china on all fronts while we are here at kindergarten level talking about hey how do we you know uh use any trust to regulate our patents in the space of any trust in the space of standards and how do we use other means to limit the patent eligibility subject matter and things like that so we're not recognizing what's on the horizon thank you curie i uh our time is up um i'd like to thank our our panelists um obviously with a tremendous wealth of expertise we appreciate you sharing your your observations and your insights and providing them for us with a very robust interesting and informative discussion i apologize to the audience that there were some very good questions but we didn't unfortunately have time to do that but i think we all benefited from hearing what our three panels had to say and share in their discussions i'd like to thank clay and the usc u.s china institute for their collaboration and putting this program together and with that uh thank you everyone appreciate your time thank you for joining us

dlNLzbyCTAM,BVTV: Europe’s wartime economy,"A year after Russia invaded Ukraine, Europe seems destined for an arms race and further economic decoupling. Hugo Dixon tells Peter Thal Larsen that extra defense spending, lost business and rebuilding costs remain far preferable to a scenario where Vladimir Putin triumphs.

endlessly protecting itself at a time when America will want to switch its attention back to China so that is going to be a big cost for Europe going forward [Music] welcome back to bvtv brought to you by Reuters breaking views I'm Peter thalassen the global editor of breaking news I'm delighted to be joined once again by Hugo Dixon coming to us from West London Hugo good to see you again lovely to be with you Peter so Hugo on Friday it will be a year since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine um safe to say that Vladimir Putin is definitely not winning that war um but it's also quite hard to think about how there might be a piece and you've been trying to sort of look forward to what might happen next now given the the difficulty of making any kind of predictions about this conflict um what do you think of some of the possibilities of what could happen well I mean I've I focused more on what it means sort of medium term for Europe um rather than but of course then to get to what it means for Europe you have to sort of think what what's like to happen on the battlefield and then what's likely to happen back in in Moscow um and I mean I think in terms of the scenarios on the battlefield I mean my general view is that the most likely scenario is that we get neither side winning and no peace deal because it would be impossible at least for the for the time being impossible for the ukrainians to agree to a peace deal that gives away some of their territory and impossible for Vladimir Putin to agree to a peace deal which means in giving up all of the territory that he's got in um Ukraine including Crimea so what you're left with is either a continuing hot war or some sort of Frozen conflict a bit like what we've had in Korea for uh 70 years almost so that's I mean not saying that it has to go on for 70 years but that's the sort of the most likely um sort of seems to me the most likely sort of scenario so long as Putin is in the Kremlin now at some point he will go I mean he will not live forever um so you know certainly in 20 years I would say that that that that will break it it might break beforehand either but this he's pushed out or or or or or or kicked out or or or dies earlier um so so then you have to look at what are the sort of post put in scenarios and even and and and even in the posts put in scenarios um I I mean my general view is that Europe is going to have a problem on its hands on its eastern Frontier and this is going to be a problem that's going to take its um toll um economically really in in three ways one is that were in an arms race and this is going to go on for quite some time we're building up we're still in the early stages as far as Europe's concerned of rebuilding its armaments Industries um the second thing is there's going to be a very big bill for rebuilding Ukraine and the third thing is that there's not going to be any serious economic re-engagement with Russia that's more of a lost opportunity because I mean there is there are more sanctions to come I mean the European Union has been considering more sanctions just today um and there will be more pressure for disinvestment from Civil Society on on on on on Western companies inside Russia so there will be some disengagement further disengagement but in a sense we've already had a lot of that disengagement um so it's more of a sort of lost opportunity but it's it but it's not going to be a big opportunity because if you think that Russia is in a big war economy situation and is going to be for some time to come um it's not going to be an interesting place for foreigners to do business yeah so if we think about the costs I mean obviously the big costs have been born by Ukraine and by the Ukrainian people in terms of deaths and destruction and so forth but but if we think about the the cost for Europe then you talked about the arms race so everybody's going to have to sort of invest more in defense and it sounds like you're saying they're going to have to keep doing that and also we're still living with much more expensive energy than before this invasion yeah gas is gas I mean obviously we're way down from the peak of last summer um but it's still if you look at sort of the forward price for this winter of gas it's four times higher than it was two years ago and then two years ago between in the last year before the the war there was a run-up in the price and and so we're not not very far from where we were a year ago but um so that's a cost that Europe is is facing in terms of competitiveness um in terms of household bills and of course in terms of um the the fiscal deficit insofar as governments are continuing to subsidize and they are continuing to subsidize both consumers and and business customers so that's that's one part of the cost that that is is certainly there but so Hugo what about this arms race that's that's happening I mean there's a lot of a lot of announcements just have a Munich security conference everybody's talking about uh building up armies and so forth um that's also presumably going to be an expense and and obviously we've seen you know both Germany and immediately after the invasion but now the new defense minister has been saying it that it will need to go beyond NATO's standard two percent of GDP Germany was nowhere near two percent of GDP if you look at what the sort of Poland is putting in the sub-arms that it wants to to to acquire I mean they're sort of mind boggling but the point I wanted to make is that this is not just for now this is actually a multi-year uh phenomenon and it's a multi-year phenomenon because even in a post-foot-in world Russia is going to be accepting the one benign scenario of a stable democracy which doesn't seem to be the most likely scenario Russia is going to be an unstable force on Europe's Eastern Frontier it will be weaker than it was some of its Army will have been destroyed it's already been destroyed but it will be rebuilding that Army and it will be learning lessons and so Europe will have to be endlessly protecting itself at a time when America will want to switch its attention back to China and has been saying for years that Europe needs to take a bigger share and now actually it will have to take a bigger share in its own defense so that is going to be a big cost for Europe going forward so it is good it is a big cost but it is still a much lower cost I think all things considered uh than than the one scenario we haven't discussed here which is where Russia were to win well indeed because if Russia were to win whatever that whatever that meant but say take you know a big chunk of Ukraine even kieval certainly what people were expecting only a year ago is that it would be pretty much a walkover for for put in then the rearmaments would be going through the roof um Europe would be concerned about not only what happens to Moldova but what happens to Poland what happens to the Baltic republics and we would be in a real full War economy situation rather than what we've got at the moment is that Russia and Ukraine are in full War economy and Europe is getting into sort of heavy rearmament phase okay Hugo fascinating as always thank you for your time and talk to you again soon thank you Peter
xqkx74evOB8,Turkey-Syria border region hit by new quakes,"A new magnitude 6.3 earthquake on Monday hit Turkey and Syria’s border region, killing three people, weeks after devastating quakes killed tens of thousands of people.

More than 200 people have also been injured in Turkey as buildings collapsed trapping some people. Dozens of injuries were also recorded in neighbouring Syria.

Monday’s earthquake was centred in the town of Defne, in Turkey’s Hatay province, one the worst-hit regions in the magnitude 7.8 and 7.6 earthquakes that struck on February 6. It was felt in Syria, Jordan, Cyprus, Israel and as far away as Egypt, and followed by a second, 5.8 magnitude temblor.

Turkish interior minister Suleyman Soylu said three people were killed and 213 injured. Search and rescue efforts were under way in three collapsed buildings where six people were believed trapped.

In Hatay, police rescued one person trapped inside a three-storey building and were trying to reach three others inside, HaberTurk television reported. It said those trapped included movers helping people shift furniture and other belongings from the building that was damaged in a previous quake.

Syria’s state news agency, SANA, reported that six people were injured in Aleppo by falling debris. The White Helmets, northwest Syria’s civil defence organisation, reported more than 130 injuries, most of them non-life threatening, including fractures and cases of people fainting from fear, while a number of buildings in areas already damaged by the earthquakes collapsed.

#Turkiye #Turkey #TurkeyEarthquake #TurkiyeEarthquake #Hatay #PrayForTurkey #Antakya",1,people in turkey and Syria are once again scared and shaken two more powerful earthquakes have rocked both countries two weeks after devastating Tremors killed more than 47 000 people well the epicenter of Monday night's stronger magnitude 6.4 Quake was now the city of antakia buildings that were already weak and have now collapsed killing at least six people and parents are left console in their terrified children yet again in Northwest Syria people fled buildings as a shaking began the white helmets volunteer group reported more than 130 injuries I said vague begins our coverage from hatai in Tokyo three more victims to add to the tens of thousands of people who have already lost their lives [Music] four men were trapped inside this building only one made it out to life they'd come to salvage what they could of their belongings when the earthquake hit the third in the space of two weeks their family members waiting hoping their relatives would be brought out alive instead they saw their loved ones carried out in body bags rescue workers had been winding down their operations when the earthquake struck we were planning to go back to our homes this earthquake has extended the process we never left the rescue operation we continued our fight did our best to pull out people alive [Applause] elsewhere a building that had survived two earthquakes in southern turkey now gone [Music] somewhere in hatai Province the car dash cam captures the moment [Music] a woman screams the Earth trembled all the buildings in hattai have collapsed they are dead and at the airport Panic as a quick hit a politician's TV interview from an Aid distribution center interrupted [Music] for families already traumatized disbelief the terror has come again scared we thought the ground would tear apart a nation rocked just two weeks after twin earthquakes appended the lives of millions killing tens of thousands and destroying countless homes it it was very difficult you know you know it was gonna happen we we were expecting that so right now so we're expecting more so everybody should be you know more prepared about this this is the moment the Quake struck Aleppo in rebel-hulled Northern Syria more misery for people suffering severe shortages in food medicine and housing on top of a decade-old civil war families are already sleeping on the streets in freezing conditions back in turkey's mayor says people are trapped under the rubble people poured into the streets another night in the cold as a sense of fear prevailed there have been thousands of aftershocks and this latest earthquake has people asking where they can go to be safe Assad tortilla when Robert McBride joins us live now from Daphne the epicenter of Monday's Quake Robert tell us more about these latest earthquakes that's right these are two Quakes really adding more misery and suffering to an area and people that have already suffered so much this is the District of Daphne this is on the edge of the city of antakia one of the cities that suffered so much of the devastation of this uh earthquake two weeks ago and this was the epicenter of one of those Quakes it happened at about 8 P.M local time here it was measured 6.4 in magnitude so it was a substantial uh Quake here and it happened at a time when people were coming back to buildings and already already been damaged and have been looking through sifting through uh what used to be their homes looking for possessions we're on a one street that has seen now extra damage this building here this used to be a five-story building like the buildings either side of it this had been damaged in the initial Quake but had still been standing sadly people tragically were back inside this building when this second Quake happened and Rescue has had to recover three bodies from this one building all down this street we are told by um the soldiers who've been here for a week now who they've said that the Quake from Monday night has completely changed once again uh the the look of this street this street was already very badly damaged you as you walk along here already some of the buildings were already gone they were turned into piles of rubble other buildings though were still standing they may have been toppled over to one stand one side that they were still standing even though they were damaged some of those buildings are even further damaged or as we've already seen a number of the buildings completely collapsed once more adding to these piles of rubble here Wendy devastating scenes there and Rob the recovery effort from the original earthquakes was challenging enough but this will surely make matters even worse that's right here in antakia I think on a Sunday they announced the last actual rescue operation looking for survivors in one building so officially on Sunday the actual rescuer efforts uh had stopped they are now moving into the recovery phase and still with the people who are living in their thousands in tented cities all around here and other cities they have been wanting to get back into buildings to try to get possessions what they can salvage again this has thrown all of that uh into confusion that it has raised alarm people who were once again living out in the streets under tents were once again outside reliving if you like all of the trauma of living through earthquakes once more and since Sunday and since Monday night's earthquakes we have been having literally scores of more aftershocks so it is a incredible concern for everybody who is here trying to rebuild their lives and wondering when that's going to happen also for the construction effort that is meant to get underway as we were driving through antacia our producer was just pointing out all of the different registration plates of literally hundreds and thousands of vehicles of diggers of excavators that are all being brought to this part of turkey a to to start the effort of clearing away Rubble of reconstruction but all of that clearly is on hold while we wait to see what other Tremors what other Quakes we might have in this already are very badly affected area Rob McBride thank you we're staying with this resource said uh joins us live from the alham crossing near the North Western Syrian City a friend Russell how are people coping with earthquakes foreign gate here has been opened in 2018 after turkey conducted a military incursion in Syria and since then it was usually used for the military purposes however after the earthquake now it is being also used for the humanitarian Aid as well not far from here just 10 kilometers away there's a town of genderes and 25 kilometers deeper there is Afrin so these two cities for these two towns particularly were hit very bad here and at the at as a result more than seven thousands more than 6 000 people have died 150 000 people are now displaced again so and also there are many more thousands that are still waiting for the help and they are injured so I have been talking to the syrians here so now they are suffering from the shortage of the Clean Water the is no electricity no heaters here not proper blankets as well particularly for children it is quite difficult here and also the rescue of force here has not been a deck weight so on the Turkish side we have seen that the roaring noise of the escalators the diggers heavy lifting machineries and also thousands of the professional Rescuers days and night relentlessly working to save the lives there but when you come to the Syrian side it's completely silence the Silence of grief Silence of Abandonment and they lack the modern equipment indeed they were using very much rudimentary equipment and even sometimes with their bare hands trying to pull out their loved ones loved ones out of the rubbles here so that that was many that was one of the main problems here the lack of the international Aid that arrived very late only days after the earthquake hit this region the International Air started to get in however ever it is very much little and they say it is very much it's too late as well they feel syrians here they feel that they're abundant they're forgotten by the International Community and they said that they've always was not heard through the last more than a decade of the Civil War and now they're caught in another disaster so here in Syria the disasters are just just overlapping and when it comes to the health facilities though that is hosting those who have the thousands that have been injured so they are either collapsed or heavily damaged or they do not have any modern medical equipment and usually they do not have the proper stuff as well so that's why life here is quite difficult and also throughout the last two weeks we have seen hundreds and hundreds of the Syrian families who fled the war in Syria almost a decade ago came to Turkey to to begin a safe life and now they are also now getting back to Syria some of them to to attend the funerals of their loved ones some of them to meet up the survivors and also on top of that we had the officials are saying that more than 1 500 dead bodies belonging to Syrian refugees in Turkey have been taken back to Syria to be buried in their home country so that is now the situation of them these people that millions of the peoples who left Syria came to Turkey to begin a new safe life now they're caught in in another disaster and they're back to where they started so they now have to restart from scratch that's all for now thanks for that update Omar al-harani reports from Afrin where people are forced to sleep on the ground this is a football pitch in the middle of a friend City where residents flocked and panic following the most recent earthquake and subsequent tremors as you can see in the absence of tents people are lying on the ground spending the night here for fear of imminent shakes many of them are survivors who lost their homes in the first two earthquakes two weeks ago their sufferings have not come to an end now there's the shortage of shelter food and medical supplies it's by all measures nothing but a tragedy in the northern part of Syria amid a poor response from the International Community the recent earthquake has exacerbated their sufferings we witnessed the state of overwhelming Panic reminiscent of the early moments of the first earthquake that hit the area on February 6th um a friend Aleppo Countryside

Does The Tesla Semi Live Up To The Hype?",2,"In Modesto, California, some
of the very first Tesla Semis are hitting the
roads. The Tesla that you can see
behind us is fully operational. They're
running up and down the road within a 400-mile radius,
delivering product to all of our distribution locations
and to our customers. We use them the same way
you would see any traditional class eight
vehicle delivering product. PepsiCo, which owns Cheetos,
Doritos and other Frito-Lay products, preordered 100
back in 2017. Walmart and FedEx have also
placed preorders, but Pepsi was the first customer to
take delivery of the new truck. PepsiCo owns one of the
largest private fleets in North America, and that's
one of the reasons we have partnered with Tesla. We have the 15 in Modesto
that we're launching, and then we have 21 in
Sacramento. And then we are working
plans for the additional units up to the hundred. First announced in 2017, the
Semi has been one of the longest delayed products in
Tesla's history. What makes the Tesla Semi so
different, and really Elon Musk's introduction of it,
is he really brought the awareness to the broader
public. He made trucking sexy. And it could also be its
vehicle with the biggest impact. Even though trucks are only
a small portion of all the vehicles operating on
California's roads, they're responsible for the vast
majority of carcinogenic diesel particulate matter. Although it's only 1% of
vehicle production, it's 20% of vehicle emissions, and
it's over a third of all the particulate emissions. The need for alternatives to
diesel is steadily rising as stricter emission
regulations are established. In California, at the ports,
you're not going to be able to use an ICE engine truck
in the near future. Electric is an ideal
solution for that. But the launch of the new
electric truck hasn't been without issues. There have
been a few sightings of the Semi breaking down around
Northern California. We can have a concept
vehicle, it can look great on stage. It can look
really compelling and exciting and talk about a
whole new future. The realities are quite
different. Welcome to the Tesla Semi
truck event. I hope you like what you
see. We're confident that this is
a product that is better in every way from a feature
standpoint, that wins on economics against diesel
trucks in a worst case scenario, and that defeats
rail in a convoy scenario. At the time, Musk said the
Semi would go into production in 2019 and made
other promises about the truck's capabilities. It really shocked, no pun
intended, a lot of the population about a lot of
the performance metrics. But delays caused the
original timeline to slip. Five years later, the Semi
has finally arrived. We're incredibly excited
tonight to actually deliver our first production Tesla
Semi trucks. And yeah, we're looking
forward to actually delivering our first
production trucks to PepsiCo. Yeah, sorry for
the delay. Omitted from the event
though were details around the economics, million mile
guarantee and Autopilot features announced at the
original 2017 unveiling. When Elon Musk introduced
the Tesla Semi, it was a big deal. It felt like this was
a revolutionary moment for trucking. Fast forward five
years when they delivered the Tesla Semi to PepsiCo,
it was actually a much different sort of
experience. It felt like they were dialing it in. They had promised these
things and were going to deliver them, but it just
didn't feel like it had the hype that we had a couple
of years ago. The trucks Pepsi received
don't have autonomous features activated yet. The autonomous functionality
of Tesla is not specced for these vehicles. They have
the hardware capability. We'll get to that down the
road as an additional capability. When it was announced, the
truck was touted to have an industry leading 500 mile
range. 500 mile range. And by the way, it's 500
miles at maximum weight at highway speed. There have
been some initial reports that it can't handle the
weight or the distance that was initially promised. And so it's more of a wait
and see. To start, Pepsi is
delivering Frito-Lay products around 425 miles
per charge. It's also delivering Pepsi
out of its Sacramento warehouse on 100 mile daily
routes, going directly to stores and 300 to 400 mile
runs to other warehouses. The contents that are the
trailer can weigh about 45,000 lbs, is really the
accepted weight. And potato chips are made
of a lot of air. When we look at soda cans,
aluminum and liquids, these things weigh a lot
and they will weigh out. Pepsi wouldn't speak to the
price of the trucks, but it is estimated to cost around
$180,000. The cost benefit is still a
bit of a question mark because I think the price
new of an electric truck isn't quite settled yet. I think it's safe to assume
that it'll be at least double the price of the
equivalent diesel model. First generation and early
development has additional research funding and all
that. That's where the
partnership and support comes in. But ongoing, we
believe there is a positive economic business case for
electrifying the fleet. But experts are predicting
that electric trucks will be cheaper to operate over
time. When you take everything
into account, a diesel truck will be 20% more expensive
than a Tesla Semi per mile. If you have a predictable
charging cost, you can eliminate the expense of
fuel and the more volatile pricing that comes along
with fuel. The big cost savings that a
lot of people are seeing as they transition to EVs is
the amount of maintenance is significantly lower than
traditional vehicles. Obviously many fleets are
thinking about it from that perspective, that total
lifetime cost is significantly better. Diesel vehicle storage tanks
are cheaper and the fuel is more expensive, electricity
is more affordable, batteries are more
expensive. There's always a constant dynamic between
those two. And so we like to diversify
our portfolio of solutions. Starting in 2019, Frito-Lay
has been transforming its Modesto facility to
demonstrate the sustainable benefits of zero and near
zero emission technologies. This project has delivered a
91% reduction in greenhouse gas, and we're using this
as a showcase to then cascade to our other
operations. PepsiCo partnered with the
California Air Resources Board to make it all
happen, matching its $15.4 million in incentives to
purchase vehicles, including Tesla Semis, to add to its
fleet of over 80,000 assets. We developed what's called
the Zero and Near Zero Emissions Freight
Facilities pilot program back in the 2019 time
frame. And this Frito-Lay facility
won one of those grants for a complete transformation
of this facility to zero emissions. We thought it would make a
smart move to make the deposit, partner with
Tesla. So we put a deposit down
several years ago for 100 units when they first
announced. We thought it would have great
application. We had the experience from the last
ten years with other EV products. Pepsi received its first
Tesla Semis in December and already has them in use. It takes us a couple of
weeks between up fitting, logoing, labeling and
driver training. We'll continue to scale
that up where over the next several months, most of the
drivers will be certified and trained to drive the
Tesla vehicles. The trucks have replaced
routes previously being served by diesel. This vehicle right here with
a 400 mile range enables the driver to leave from
Modesto and return home without stopping and
charging anywhere along the route. Our average length of haul
for over the road is about 425 miles, so we believe
across the entire portfolio at Frito-Lay and Beverages
that the Tesla Semis will meet our delivery needs
based on our network. To charge the trucks,
Frito-lay installed four Megachargers, Tesla's
latest charging technology. What you can see behind me
are our four Tesla Megachargers. They're
capable of charging 750 kilowatts. These trucks
here take about an hour to charge, which will give us
about 400 miles of range. The local utilities, the
Tesla infrastructure team, we had to bring additional
power into the site. Although Pepsi wouldn't
allow us to interview the drivers, O'Connell says
feedback has been positive. They like not needing to
fuel the vehicles. They come in and plug them
in and can leave them. And they like the overall
performance. In addition to the Tesla
Semis, Frito-Lay Modesto is also using electric trucks
from BYD and Peterbilt. We have six of these
Peterbilt electrified route trucks that are charged
onsite and used by our sales team to deliver our product
to any of our stores in the community here in Modesto. We have several hundred of
those vehicles in several locations that we've
implemented. The company is also using
compressed natural gas trucks. This is a fully operational
class eight CNG vehicle. We have 37 of them in
operations here in Modesto. We have the same complement
of range that you would see in any diesel tractor. Competition in the electric
truck space is heating up. As the Tesla semi enters
service, it comes at a time when several truck
manufacturers are embracing the transition to electric
and alternative fuels. All the traditional diesel
truck manufacturers also have electric truck
offerings. So your Freightliners, Kenworths,
Peterbilts, Volvos, Macks, International, they all
have electric trucks that are out there already. Volvo just recently launched
its VNR Electric Semi, a class eight truck with a
565-kilowatt battery capable of up to 275 miles of
range. Daimler has announced plans
to develop its own heavy-duty electric truck,
the Mercedes-Benz eActros LongHaul, that will have a
range of around 310 miles. Freightliner, also a part
of Daimler, has the eCascadia, a class eight
semi with a 315 and 475 kilowatt version,
offering up to 250 miles of range. One of the advantages that
other OEMs have over Tesla is that they know how to
sell into the over-the-road trucking business and into
the class eight environment. They've been doing it for
years. They have a lot of experience. They know what
fleets want. They know how they spec
trucks. They know what drivers want. They have
maintenance networks that exist across the country. They're just much better
positioned today than what Tesla is to sell into this
environment. But even with so much
activity in the space, it's still in early stages. To introduce an electric
vehicle that can solve the mission that's required of
these vehicles. It takes many years, many
designs and a lot of testing and a substantial amount of
investment. We're in the very early part of that
cycle and it's going to take a few years before we see
these vehicles become commercially viable. For trucking to go fully
electric, it will require significant charging
infrastructure development. There's a huge amount of
infrastructure that needs to be built. We think about it
as the kind of infrastructure that gets
built once a century. You had the railroads two
centuries ago, you had the National Highway Network a
century ago, and the scale is very similar to that. Charging sites for
heavy-duty trucks are much more demanding than your
average EV. If you have 20 semi trucks
charging all at one time, that's almost the same
amount of power that it would take to power 20 big
box stores. Think of that kind of scale
of power required. The reliability is also
very important. Fleet, for them, time is
money and they have to know that their vehicles will be
able to move when they want them to. Electric trucks also have a
weight problem. Compared to diesel, they're
much heavier, impacting the total load that they can
transport. The total weight, and that
includes the truck, trailer and the cargo, is 80,000
lbs i the United States. They have allowed through
some of the new regulation for electric vehicles to go
to 82,000 lbs, but that's the maximum gross weight
that a vehicle can have. For Tesla, scaling
manufacturing of its new truck will be an uphill
battle. We'll be ramping up Semi
production through next year. As everyone knows at
this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production. We're tentatively aiming
for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North
America. That sounds extremely high
when you think that 240,000 class eight trucks built
total, Freightliner builds maybe 50,000 of those. So they're talking about
competing with the big dogs in the existing commercial
truck space. To meet this ambitious goal,
the company just announced it will expand its
Gigafactory in Nevada with a new 100 gigawatt hour cell
factory and a high volume factory to manufacture the
Semi. The numbers I saw, maybe 500
this year will be built. 500 this year I can
definitely see. 50,000 in 2024, I guess
we'll have to wait to see on that one. Despite the progress being
made, not all trucking can go emission free. If you look at diesel in
terms of the power you can produce in the engine, on a
weight basis, it produces far more power than what an
electric powertrain will do. So because of those trade
offs, you're effectively dealing with these
compromises that you don't have to make with diesel. Eventually, though,
regulations may force most freight operations to
abandon diesel. The more stringent EPA
regulations are coming out. There's going to be another
level of diesel emissions regulations going into
effect in 2027. This is going to be an all
of the above solution to meet EPA requirements. So we'll see some hydrogen
fuel cell trucks out there. We'll see plenty of natural
gas trucks out there probably. In the U.S., California has
been one of the most aggressive states in
driving this. California has a regulation
called Advanced Clean Trucks, which requires
manufacturers to sell an increasing proportion of
their sales as zero emissions and ultimately
getting to fully zero emissions by 2045 in all
sectors of the heavy-duty trucking industry. And with some of the
country's largest ports, it is putting significant
pressure on the industry to adapt. It is the epicenter of North
American import and export supply chain. And so what that means is
that if California forces the industry to go carbon
neutral and eliminate the internal combustion engine,
it means that automotive manufacturers and
manufacturers have zero recourse against that. They
will have to do this, because if they don't, they
won't be able to sell vehicles into the industry,
into one of the most important markets in the
entire world. Operationalizing any type of
fleet portfolio, electrified, natural gas,
renewable diesel, there are challenges, but you can
really make it all work without making as big a
trade offs as people think. The next 5 to 10 years,
you'll start to see a pretty significant inflection in
the S-curve for adoption, especially for commercial
vehicles, given that total cost of operation is
significantly more beneficial than ICE
vehicles. I'd say by the end of the decade, I would say
at least 50% of commercial fleets would be
electrified. We know we have the
technology and we have the policies in place. It's just a matter of
getting the coordination to happen and continuing to
make progress. You've got to give Elon Musk
credit. This guy promises an
enormously exciting future with really
transformational technologies. And he's a
world-class visionary that really is trying to set the
tone for everything. And he's put everybody on
notice and eventually they may get there. We may get
to a point where we actually see the performance metrics
that he's promised and the economics that he's
promised. But we're not there yet."

than building something on land believe us even now mankind can build facilities of incredible scale in rivers seas and oceans if you have any doubts about that our video for today will definitely clear them let's get it on cofferdam do you remember your last visit to the dentist your doctor probably used a very strange tool the aching tooth remains outside and the rest of the oral cavity is covered with a latex sheet what does underwater construction have to do with that you may ask it's simple this thing is called a cofferdam and engineers have figured out how to use it to build the most complex structures imagine you need to build a bridge across the sea straight how do you lay the foundation if there's only water around put on diving suits and do all the work in them not the brightest idea this is where the dentist tools come in of course the scale of the cofferdam is different first piles are driven into the bottom of the reservoir and then they're covered with a waterproof frame it's usually made of steel and concrete but the modern designs are inflatable after the desired area is isolated water is pumped out of it using powerful pumps and here you go now you have a completely dry and safe box where you can work just as well as on land the only downside of cofferdams is that they are very expensive and you can't use them multiple times after the construction is completed they are flooded bridge in the usa while we're talking about the cost of building a bridge let's look at this process in all of its details well the bridge you're about to see is not quite ordinary at the beginning of the 21st century the u.s authorities faced a problem the old stillwater bridge which connected the states of minnesota and wisconsin was in a very bad state however in order to start building a new bridge across the saint croix river builders had to consider many historical cultural and environmental peculiarities of the region the reservoir is under state protection the coastal area is inhabited by endangered species and activists control every step what could you do the project changed several times over roughly 20 years but by 2014 the minnesota department of transportation had found the perfect solution a special innovative design was chosen to minimize the impact on the environment it reduced the number of supports you can see the result the same croi crossing bridge is one and a half kilometers long and more than 45 meters tall though it only has five supports in the water does this affect its strength not at all the four-lane bridge easily withstands both ice and summer heat but the innovative technology was pricey the saint croix crossing cost 700 million dollars to build wind farm at sea did you find the previous project not challenging enough well let's see how a truly magnificent structure was built near the borkham island in 2016 germany decided to use one of the greenest energy sources to its advantage they went and set up a massive wind farm right in the turbulent waters of the north sea why not the conditions for the power plant were perfect there was regular strong wind all the time so the only thing left to do was to manufacture transport and install parts of colossal dimensions just so you understand the farm consists of 67 turbines with a 154 meter rotor which produces a total power of 402 megawatts how much is that there are a million watts in one megawatt and the light bulbs in your house consume about a hundred watts let's put it simply this is enough to provide 400 000 homes with electricity the hardest part was creating the foundation for the mills to protect it from the destructive power of the sea special piles were designed these are the giant pipes that you now see on the screen each pipe is 85 meters long about 8 meters in diameter and weighs more than 1300 tons even more surprising is that the construction of the invader mates took only 23 months seems like mankind can truly do anything peer restoration what is more difficult to build a huge object in the water from a scratch or to renovate an existing one don't rush to give an answer until you look at the refurbishment of a 580 metre pier in melbourne prince's pier has an immense cultural significance in australia it served as a departure point for australian troops during the first and the second world wars and was the landing site for thousands of post-war migrants however this historical structure gradually deteriorated the piles rotted and the deck collapsed in many places this only makes things harder for the development victoria company the pier simply couldn't withstand the heavy equipment required to carry out the work but modern problems require modern solutions so two 300 300-ton jack-up barges 120-ton crawler cranes and professional divers were involved in the reconstruction of the facility the latter had to disassemble the wooden elements piece by piece while the machines dealt with the concrete base the famous gate house was also restored even without dismantling it the hydraulic unit lifted it entirely four years and 34 million dollars later the project was completed and the pier reopened to the public be sure to check it out if you visit australia one day construction of a breakwater everything is clear with bridges piers and power plants but what is this weird structure it looks like a giant snake tail assembled from lego pieces but it's not built just for fun right to find out its purpose we'll travel to haifa the largest of the three international ports in israel it's also known as one of the largest ports in the eastern mediterranean in terms of freight traffic it handles over 29 million tons of cargo annually naturally such an important object requires serious protection primarily from the unpredictable forces of nature the snake tail we saw is actually a huge pier stretching several kilometers into the sea and protecting heifer from the waves it was built in several stages first layer by layer an earth mound was created can you imagine the amount of earth that took then the embankment was strengthened with a reinforced concrete foundation and only then these funny-looking concrete blocks are put in place they are designed to break the waves by the way how do they dismantle the crane after the project is completed we hope that they thought this through flood protection every one of us built sand and pebbled dams on the beach these guys are doing the same thing but on a slightly larger scale you are now observing the construction of a flood protection system on hailing island in the uk the coastline began to collapse and 1800 houses could have been flooded the eastern solent coastal partnership has partnered with the environment agency and raymond brown construction to save the local property the first stage of construction was the most difficult it's clear that the constant tides constantly interfered with the construction works though putting the stones in place and flattening the sand might seem relatively easy the heavy equipment worked on the beach for six months over this time about 70 000 tons of rock imported from norway turned into a protective wall 650 meters long in addition 25 000 tons of pebbles were scattered to hold rising sea levels and improve the beach area the project costs about six and a half million dollars and it will protect the inhabitants of the island for at least a hundred years sounds like quite a complicated endeavor right offshore oil platform finally we will find out the answer to the question that has long bothered us how do these huge oil rigs appear in the seas well let's travel to the gulf of mexico to see how shell's largest floating oil platform was built hundreds of engineers worked on the design of a gigantic platform called the apomotox over four years it's not just the size though it is impressive the platform is 29 stories high two football fields wide and weighs more than an aircraft carrier the structure also had to be extremely durable the creators wanted it to last at least 40 years twice as long as any other platform the task is extremely challenging considering that the apomotox is located in an area with really bad weather conditions and some of its parts will be submerged to a depth from almost two and a half kilometers the team had to really give the project a lot of thought what kind of pipe insulation could withstand 40 years of exposure to salt water and temperature extremes the builders had to ask chemists for help and then the construction began it took two years to build four gigantic modules that form the top of the platform each module weighs more than 10 000 tons and it was necessary not only to raise them to a height of 18 meters but also to set them with a precision of up to one centimeter as you may have guessed the builders were up to the challenge but you must admit it's still quite hard to believe hey

© 2022 The B1M Limited",2,construction projects don't come much bigger than this hs2 is a new high-speed railway being built right up the heart of britain with the promise of economic growth low carbon travel more capacity and some of the fastest trains on earth high speed 2 is one of the world's biggest infrastructure projects it'll start right here in the heart of london and run across through and under england's countryside to the midlands and one day beyond but building it is far from easy the project has gone several times over budgets and face delays and staunch opposition it's now known more for its setbacks and the decisions of those in power then its benefits or the incredible engineering that's going on an idea to bring a country closer together has become divisive hs2 will generate jobs skills and economic growth it is just a waste of money a terrible waste of taxpayers money and that's not just a uk issue we're seeing this everywhere when public money is involved the stakes get much higher the scrutiny gets more intense and when things go wrong it can become difficult or even impossible to stop so how much say do we really have over the massive projects like high speed 2 built with our money can our governments ever stop once they've started and does they come a point with these projects where they're just no longer worth it we can now travel over land at the rate of 30 miles an hour think of it ladies and gentlemen 30 miles an hour houston departure point for 175 trains every day we need to build new railway lines in our country we haven't built a line north of london for 120 years it will redefine the way we travel around our country i'm absolutely convinced finally giving the home of the roadways the fast connections they need another back now that it makes any sense without hs2 the way that uk government makes decisions with ebb and flow depending on the political weather that's not how you deliver major infrastructure we're in a climate emergency we need to be doing sustainable creation not destroying the country this project is absolute madness in the whole size of hs 2 the only thing to do is keep digging hs2 will deliver lots of benefits there's no question about that the question is whether it's worth the costs like many countries the uk is divided there are big economic and social differences between the capital and the rest of the country and there's little sign of anything changing back in 2009 the government proposed a new high-speed railway to better connect london and the north of england spreading wealth up the country three years later that project was approved and billions of taxpayer cash was set aside for it it's called high speed 2 which is often shortened to hs2 and it's being built in three stages phase one runs from london to birmingham phase two a will carry the route to a town called crew and 2b takes it to manchester and originally leeds high-speed trains would then continue on to other parts of the country at normal speeds using the existing network so those living in the wider north and scotland can benefit too the trains will have a top speed of 225 miles an hour the fastest in europe now to do that they need a track that's as straight and flat as possible but drawing a straight flat line up england isn't easy some ninety percent of the phase one route will be up on bridges and viaducts or dug below ground in tunnels and cuttings making it an immense feat of engineering a journey north from london will begin here in a new three-story terminal at houston it'll have the uk's longest concourse a pre-fabricated geometric roof and 10 platforms built some eight meters below ground this site down here at houston is where that massive new terminal is going to start to rise in the years to come now it might not look like much right now but just getting to this stage has been tough going and the team has faced all the kind of challenges you might expect them to face when clearing a site like this in the heart of a major city existing buildings neighbouring properties traffic services and of course the current live railway running into houston alongside them after houston trains will arrive at aldo common where there'll be additional links to heathrow airport wales and the southwest the first landmark outside london is the cone valley viaduct it'll run for 3.4 kilometers across several waterways and become the country's longest railway crossing next up is the 16 kilometer chilton tunnel the longest and deepest on the entire route sitting up to 90 meters underground then it's another tunnel but this one is less about length and depth and more about what's above it the uk has over three hundred thousand hectares of ancient woodland that's trees that have been around since sixteen hundred despite weather in the ages some of those trees now find themselves in the path of hs2 instead of cutting them all down planners have tried to limit their destruction and one way is to go underneath them like up here at long itchington wood this is one of hs2's new tunnels and just behind me back there is where construction teams are working away to dig this route deep beneath england's countryside now when you're down here you can't help but be blown away by the scale of the engineering that's going into this project in years to come people on trains are going to pass through here in a matter of seconds they'll be drinking a coffee doing some emails and they probably won't even notice but to make that leisurely experience possible construction teams are putting in the grind using 2 000 ton tunnel boring machines like this to cut a path the machines feature a cutting head at the front and a system that quickly takes soil back up to the surface in these pipes along the side of the tunnel this is the very front of one of hs2's tunnel boring machines just ahead of me up there is a massive cutting head that's steadily eating its way through the soil by about 20 to 24 meters a day slowly but surely this machine is building part of hs2 the long itchington tunnel will run for 1.6 kilometers and be the first to complete across the whole route when it finishes in 2023 it's just one example of some of the massive feats of engineering that are taking place between london and the midlands to enable this high speed line to run in time those incredibly fast trains are going to run across the ground i'm currently standing on through this cutting and on towards birmingham the last stop before birmingham is the solihull interchange currently billed as the world's most eco-friendly railway station with connections to the airport and the exhibition center phase one then all culminates at birmingham kurzon street it's the first intercity rail terminus built in the uk since the 1800s and it'll feature an arched roof inspired by the railway pioneers of that era it's all a lot of work and money to connect london and the midlands but there's a payoff economic growth the idea is that the billions being poured into this project will be paid back and that millions of people will have their quality of life improved high-speed rail effectively brings major cities and population centres closer together businesses can access larger customer bases supply chains and labor pools integration and trade are improved productivity goes up and commuting longer distances becomes possible you no longer have to buy a house in an expensive region in order to work there and that takes pressure off the housing crisis hs2 will slash journey times getting from london to birmingham will take just 45 minutes 37 minutes quicker than today but better connectivity between regions is about more than just speed there's another key word in all this capacity if you take a look at the uk's rail map you might question whether this project makes any sense london already has a direct connection to birmingham and manchester via the west coast mainline so why build another well because it's one of the busiest railways in europe it's used by intercity local and freight trains all at the same time and things can get crowded hs2 will be just for high-speed passenger trains it'll mean getting up and down the country quicker and free up much needed space on the existing lines the hope is that this all makes taking the train an obvious choice as compared to driving or catching a domestic flight it's designed to be the world's most sustainable high-speed railway offering carbon-free travel from the day the trains start running it all seems like a good idea but there are some who question whether the uk actually needs this high-speed line at all unlike some other countries renowned for their high-speed rail networks the uk's major cities are all much closer together that's a factor that's perpetuated the lack of an extensive high-speed network in the uk to date and one reason why it hasn't cultivated much homegrown talent or expertise good at building it the guy tasked with assembling and leading the team that's having a go for the first time in decades is mark thurston hs2 is a once in a generation project we will connect all the major cities on that corridor in our country at high speed clearly make a massive difference to the way we decarbonise our transport system it is unprecedented over 300 sites alone just between here and the west midlands but also again if you look around us here in houston we're right on top of the local community so how do we build this railway sensitively in a way that respects people who've got to kill their lives you know for some years yet one until this railway is fully commissioned now you might be wondering who gets the say over whether or not big expensive projects that impact so many people's lives like this get to happen well it's complicated but stick with us because grasping this will help you better understand how your tax money is being spent the uk is a constitutional monarchy the sovereign is in charge but delegates all their power to a democratically elected government and lower house of parliament called the house of commons like many countries we elect people from each region to sit on that parliament and represent us the political party that wins the most seats forms the government they get to control all the government departments and decide which laws are introduced and debated in the house of commons they pretty much set the agenda now we decide which candidate or party we're going to vote for based on what they say they're going to do and in the uk the two major parties the conservatives and labor both advocate the principle of a new high-speed rail line so in a way the people chose this the elected uk government formally decided to build hs2 back in 2012 after a lot of debate and consultation finally in 2017 parliament overwhelmingly passed a bill giving the government special powers to build operate and maintain phase one when boris johnson then became prime minister in 2019 he commissioned the okavi review to advise his government on whether and how to proceed with the project then he made the final call the cabinet has given high speed rail the green signal we are we are going to get this done at that point with powers already obtained from parliament back in 2017 boris signed the final notice to proceed with the project permission for phase 2a followed in 2021 to try and get a better understanding of this complicated process and how it's used to approve projects like hs2 i went to see stephen glaister he's emeritus professor of transport and infrastructure at imperial college london and he was a contributor to that okave review the parliamentary process of course is very important to the big scheme like this you can't build a railway in this country without parliamentary approval the government has made a decision in principle to build this scheme so it's a matter of policy to build the whole scheme the parliamentary process is to allow people badly affected to make their case about how their interests should be dealt with in 2012 when the project was first backed it was given a target finish date of 2026 for phase one and 2033 for phase two the initial budget was set at 32.7 billion pounds that's a lot of cash it gets funded by something called a granting aid from the governments which in turn gets its money from the taxpayer in public people like me and you small amounts gathered from millions of us can create a hefty budget and that's what puts most national infrastructure projects in a completely different budget galaxy to skyscrapers or other buildings funded by private companies or people even tech giants like google facebook or apple don't spend more than a few single-digit billions on their flagship projects and they're some of the richest firms in the world now you'd think that combining such a big budget with the uk's history as the birthplace of the railways would be a winning formula but hs2 hasn't gone to plan and public opinion now is generally far from positive data from may 2022 shows that only seven percent of brits strongly support hs2 compared to 19 that strongly oppose it so what happened between the original business case when people were sold hs2 and all those benefits made it feel like a bit of a no-brainer and today well the short answer is that the ambitious dream of redefining how people travel has begun to clash hard with the realities of making it happen many are unhappy with the choice of root residents and businesses have had to be moved out of the way thousands of people have been served with compulsory purchase notices and others have seen their properties plummet in value these initial works mark the start of years of heavy construction and a crash in the value of property nearby sadly this is often the trade-off when building infrastructure to benefit millions a minority are asked to pay a heavy price building project like this on a route like this inevitably means you have to make some tough decisions at some points on the way around what has to move out of the way yeah i mean if you look at what we're doing here just at houston alone you know right on top of the local community a live railway station just behind us uh massive demolitions in the background here just to sort of clear the footprint for the station so to your point those tough decisions are made you could point to multiple examples of them all along the route however some property owners feel they've been offered unfair valuations and have criticized how they were dealt with but perhaps the biggest source of contention has been the project's environmental impact even with sections like the long itchington tunnel which aimed to protect ancient woodland as much as possible around 24 hectares will be lost on phase one across 25 sites that's around 34 football pitches hs2 say this only amounts to the partial destruction of these habitats and they're planting millions of new trees in return that they are responsible for maintaining when you put you know point-to-point city high-speed connections in place that has the economic effect but to do that we've had to be really sensitive about the impact on the natural environment got a target to plant some seven million bushes and trees along the route we're always we're getting close to north of seven hundred thousand already we're very sensitive to and it's sympathetic to to that natural environment now you could argue that people and businesses might in time adapt and move on from a difficult compulsory purchase of their land but trees that have been around since the time of elizabeth the first aren't coming back any time soon and that's tough for some to swallow the anger has boiled over into numerous protests from sites way out in the country to the heart of the capital in a park in front of houston station some people who want hs2 stopped have set up a protest camp there are 80 000 people here and they all walk through the open countryside here and hs2 is a concrete electrified scar that will cut them off from their access to countryside many also believe the project poses a huge threat to animals and other plant life even though efforts are being made to protect species like endangered bats and the scheme is projected to leave behind 30 percent more wildlife habitats than exist currently hs2 claims it's been employing more stringent environmental standards than in many other countries building high-speed tracks and right there you have one of the reasons why this project which was already pricey to begin with is now set to become the most expensive high-speed railway in the world that 32 billion figure from earlier was only the initial budget from 2012. after just one year the estimate had risen to 42.6 billion it then went up to 55.7 billion in 2015 and that's the number that parliament passed the bill on in 2017. two years later hs2 put the cost at around 88 billion while in 2020 the okavi review found the bill could go as high as 106 billion today the government puts the cost somewhere between 72 and 98 billion pounds and with billions more in what's called future cost pressures now being reported that number isn't final the current global inflation and supply chain challenges could all start to have an impact too 44.6 billion is now going on phase one alone more than the entire project was supposed to cost at first and almost 15 billion pounds of that has already been spent we asked hs2 for comment on these budget issues and they responded that the project remains within budget meaning the latest budget that's been set they added that the original budget was worked out using simple calculations and 2011 rates that didn't take the scheme's full complexities into account whatever your take on this the cost now is a lot more than what was in the budget when parliament chose to approve it would our elected mps have made a different decision if they knew how much it would eventually cost parliament was asked to make a decision in principle but they were offered a set of costs which are much less than the out turn costs had they been offered at a cost of a hundred billion they might have come to a different answer on behalf of us all the project's been hit by delays too phase one was supposed to finish in 2026 but now it's 2029 at the earliest as for the entire network which was meant to wrap up by 2033 it could now be as late as 2041 2b hasn't cleared parliament yet so exact details of what it will look like and where it will go remain uncertain a bit of a case of to be or not to be along the route there have been some unexpected complications which have had pretty dramatic consequences in 2019 ground conditions had become in the words of hs2's then chairman significantly more challenging than predicted he revealed that the 2015 cost estimate for phase one was made without the benefits of any investigation of ground conditions or similar levels of detail across all areas of scope more time has been needed for ground settlements adding to the delays and there have had to be route changes further north to avoid obstacles like salt mines it's also been revealed that the cost of buying up property for phase one is over three times more than first thought at around 3.9 billion pounds that's according to figures provided to us by hs2 they added that every home business and piece of land is unique and there are sometimes different opinions between owners their professional advisors and hs2 about the value of a property in all cases we seek a fair deal for both claimants and the taxpayer there have been delays to the stations too including here at houston the latest designs were only revealed in march 2022 seven years after the first images were made public and after construction here had already begun and yet there's more one major decision has sparked anger and disappointment in the region that was supposed to benefit most from this project london's one of the world's top financial centers with a higher gdp across its metropolitan area than anywhere else in europe and a habit of spending big on infrastructure but many other parts of the uk like here in leeds haven't seen the same levels of infrastructure and public services investments creating a north-south divide that's only getting bigger the north of england has long suffered with outdated transport systems while the capital continues to get more big projects like the elizabeth line one of the current uk government's big pledges at the last election was to level up the whole country now that involves boosting local economies outside london and building a high-speed train line to them would be a good start to try and really understand the north-south divide and what a high-speed railway could do for this part of the country i caught up with henry morrison from the northern powerhouse partnership it's an independent body that represents businesses and civic leaders across the north how much of a north-south divide is there in the uk and is it getting better or worse in your view so our analysis of the most recent ons data which is collected for all the regions of the uk shows that london has really bounced back and the challenge is that the rest of the country is still lagging behind and in reality under this current government we're not making huge progress it may take longer to see some of the benefits of some of the leveling up projects but they're often too short-term not focused enough on long-term productivity and so unlikely to yield the longer-term benefits we need economically but this is exactly the kind of issue that hs2 was designed to fix so now the people of the north can look forward to phase 2b being completed and all the economic advantages it's going to bring then there's northern powerhouse rail another major program of upgrades which would link with hs2 as part of a new integrated rail plan for the region sounds like things are looking up at last but there's a big problem when those costs were getting out of hand and it was decided that part of the route had to be shelved it was the bit that runs right here to leeds that took the hit that route we showed earlier going all the way up to leeds is no longer happening and that northern powerhouse rail scheme has also been downgraded the eastern leg of phase 2b will now terminate near nottingham over 70 miles away trains will still be able to go further north but only on existing non-high-speed lines although the intention is to get to leeds eventually and ideas have been put forward nothing's been confirmed there's just a study which in itself is set to cost a further 100 million pounds the original plan which was deliver hs2 in full and northern powerhouse rail from here through bradford across to manchester is now not being delivered so losing both with no certainty exactly over what will replace it there's a notional promise from government of some hs2 trains coming to leeds well we don't know how frequent or what the capacity will be so we don't really know the value so we are talking to the government now about the eastern leg certainly having traveled in around the midlands and the north a lot on rail you see the stark difference between the sort of frequency and regularity of services compared to london and southeast so that's i think where we need to sort of put our focus next working with the department for transport but that's not all of it the project is still being scaled back and again it's the north that's affected even while we were making this film another key section connecting to the west coast mainline was cut it was through here that high-speed trains would have continued on as far as scotland the government says it's now committed to finding the best solution to take hs2 trains to scotland and will explore alternatives deliver similar benefits there's issues to iron out in manchester as well like the decision to build the main station on the surface rather than underground which has been criticized by some local officials currently a journey from london to leeds in the uk looks like this now this trip is taking me two hours and 13 minutes under the original plans for hs2 that would have been dramatically cut to just one hour and 21 minutes but when phase one completes the difference will be just 20 minutes from what we were promised with hs2 that original dream this this fantastic railway connecting all parts of the uk or certainly the north has public opinion shifted now i think that the public opinion uh is wary of a government that isn't prepared to keep its promises to the north of england in this country we are entirely dependent on who the occupants of number 10 and 11 are for whether leeds gets a mass transit system or where the leads get to take chess 2 station or whether leeds gets access to a train line that supposedly for its own benefit now that doesn't mean the north isn't getting anything at all billions have been spent to upgrade transport links across this region through that new integrated rail plan but for many people up here that doesn't make up for the loss of high-speed rail which they were promised by the government the integrated rail plan represented 36 billion of cuts to what had originally been promised and that rather than just being an economic problem it's also a political problem for a government that claims it's leveling up if you had to describe hs2 in a single word what would that word be starts and a problem the problem is that i don't think this government intends to finish it to their credit those currently working for hs2 are doing their best to move on from the past and politics and just focus on constructing the railway but despite the good job that teams on the front line are doing it's clear that what's currently being built is a long way from what was put forward at the beginning and there's little sign of this project ever being stopped so is it time for a radical rethink or does this railway now simply have to be finished no matter the cost hs2 might have gone from an ambitious dream to a bit of a nightmare but the uk is far from the only countries who have had a few difficulties when it comes to building new infrastructure in fact many other public funded railways have also fallen behind schedule and gone over budget california high-speed rail in the u.s and stuttgart 21 in germany are just two examples big energy projects don't seem to fare much better either the oikoloto3 power plant in finland and china's three gorges dam both faced big challenges but it's not just the setbacks that feel repetitive infrastructure schemes like these all seem to fall back on the same vague positive sounding and almost unquestionable counter-argument to their problems the promise of long-term economic gain the almost counter trump card to all the delay the controversy is this this card of economic gain economic growth and actually this is going to be it's painful now but it's going to be worth it in the long run don't worry where's the line how many more billions how many more cost uplifts how many more unexpected events before we say actually you know what this just isn't worth it anymore it's just too much hassle and we're never going to see the benefits or are we locked into this now whatever it takes there's no mechanistic way of deciding whether or not something's worthwhile at the end of the day it is of course a decision for government on behalf of the nation people do not understand what this is going to cost the taxpayer if you take 100 billion and divide that by the population of the country it turns out to be over a thousand pounds per head and bearing in mind that hs2 will be of use direct value to a rather small proportion of population so there's a real issue there another way of looking at that is 100 million pounds a week every week for 20 years are there days where you question whether or not the whole thing's worth it uh no not really not really i mean you've got to believe uh in a project like this to do my job and and all the people that work with me you've got to believe it's an important project so of course as you say there are swings and roundabouts and all big projects have sort of dark moments but you you the highs more than outweigh the lows we have to just keep going and see it through or is there a line where we're just spending too much money taking too much time for not enough economic gain well ultimately that's a big question for the politicians but but let's be really clear one of the things we did in my first sort of 18 months is reset the budget for phase one i inherited both the budget and the time frame which proved to be undeliverable you know but textbooks generally can and should have confidence that we've set ourselves up now deliver the project for the budgets we've committed to government when done properly the payoff of big public projects can be huge they have the ability to shape our world and change its course better connectivity between countries cleaner more affordable energy lifting people out of poverty limiting the impact of natural disasters it's all made possible by infrastructure projects that's why so many national governments look to schemes like this and approve them despite their financial social and environmental costs infrastructure has the potential to make a big lasting impact and enable countless other aspects of our societies all with the added benefit of creating something very tangible and quite literally concrete to show voters but the bigger the rewards the bigger the risks and the costs the stakes all round get much higher and everything becomes magnified yes things go wrong in other parts of construction we've seen unfinished skyscrapers which usually happens when private developers run out of cash but when it's public money that's on the line that word unfinished becomes unthinkable i do think that there's a problem in the british system and maybe in other countries too whereby governments get committed to a controversial idea and because it's controversial they make firm promises and then if it turns out on further investigation not to be such a good idea they defend the idea rather than being able to to review it i've said many times this this project divides opinion uh you know it draws a huge amount of public money it's disruptive it takes a long time uh and and people struggle sometimes to justify the the investment in it but of course those railways are invested in high-speed rail i've never regretted it britain's high speed 2 is a potent reminder of the power of infrastructure it shows us once again what the construction industry can do and the impact it can have on so much of our lives the teams pulling off the extraordinary feats of engineering to create this railway are quite literally writing this country's next chapter into its land for whatever the mistakes of this project's management or the discourse around its very existence that's something that can't be taken away from these amazing people and it'll inspire future generations of engineers and yet around the world the impact of what teams like this do places them in a firestorm of debate infrastructure schemes almost always face an uphill battle to deliver on their pledges and restore faith with the people they'll serve we might be the ones coughing up the cash but we're not calling the shots while governments can be voted out once projects like this get going and the train has left the station there can be no going back hs2 epitomizes the story of the infrastructure mega project huge benefits are laid out for future generations that citizens of today must bear the cost of just as our predecessors did for us the promise of a bigger prize ahead is used to counter painful issues and becomes the lens we see them through fear of stopping drives people on supporters and detractors are selective with their facts we're told that we'll one day forget it all and only experience the benefits but that verdict is cruelly deferred by decades only time will reveal the true extent of hs2 success and whether the decision to carry on was really worth it but like so many infrastructure projects around the world it will undoubtedly leave its mark on this nation it's not the first massive scheme in history to daunt people with its costs challenges and ambition and it won't be the last it will redefine the economic geography of our country it would transform the way we think about low carbon travel in our country and i think frankly certainly if you're based in the midlands and you live in the midlands and the north you won't realize the true effects you'll have until it's until it's open like so many of the world's biggest infrastructure projects britain's high speed 2 promises enormous benefits requires huge amounts of money is grappling with immense challenges and contains enough naughts and trade-offs to sharply divide opinion but for whatever you may think of this another big public projects like it it's kind of time that more of us sat up and took notice of the extraordinary influence the construction sector has on all of our lives and the massive projects being built with our money and in our names guys if you enjoyed this video and you want to find out more about this incredible industry make sure you're subscribed to the b1m you

Viktor Józsa, Ron Hochsprung",2,this episode of real engineering is brought to you by our very own graph paper notebooks now available in three different sizes in the not too distant future you could be flying in one of these incredible planes a configuration you've likely only ever seen used in high-tech military aircraft like the b2 spirit but this plane won't be used to carry weapons it will be used to ferry hundreds of passengers around the world and use vastly less fuel in the process this blended wing aircraft is capable of causing a seismic shift in the airline industry greater than any other technology advanced before it over the past 60 years airliners have evolved drastically while the tried and tested tube and wing layout has remained largely unchanged less obvious innovations have allowed commercial airline travel to become an unremarkable part of everyday life one statistic illustrates the continual evolution of airliners better than any other this graph shows a downward trend that has been caused by unyielding efforts to innovate this line represents the average fuel burn per passenger per kilometer engineers have managed to find ways to reduce the amount of fuel these planes burn by nearly 50 percent over the past five decades allowing travel to not only get cheaper but more eco-friendly per passenger kilometer traveled from improved wing geometries like the eclectic mix of wingtip designs we see across different airliners the splice wing tips of the 737 max the wingtip fences of the 8380 the blended winglets of the a350 and the raked wingtips of the 787 each design attempts to minimize the vortex track the drag caused by many tornadoes forming at the end of each wing these tornadoes cause more fuel to be burned these wingtip devices alone can reduce airliners fuel consumption by up to six percent engines have of course undergone radical changes the most obvious changes being the continual increase in engine size over time there are uncountable innovations and many of them are hidden from view however one thing really hasn't changed all that much in those five decades the tube and wing has stood the test of time the first time we saw this format take to the air was the boeing b-47 stratojet in 1947. this may look to you as a perfectly normal plane but for the time it was unique with a long skinny fuselage long and narrow swept back wings with jet engines mounted in pods under the wing this plane was incredibly capable and popular with the us military and its success resulted in boeing investing vast amount of money into perfecting the format and creating assembly lines to churn them out this is the template of the modern airliner and boeing soon used it to develop the world's first successful commercial jet airliner the boeing 707 which began the tube and wings domination of the commercial airliner industry its advantages made it a difficult king to dethrone the circular cross section is perfect for repeated pressure cycles as the plane rises up and down through the atmosphere sometimes multiple times a day it's easy to create variants of each plane model by simply adding or subtracting tube sections to lengthen or shorten the plane this allows aircraft companies like boeing to quickly offer variants of existing planes without forcing pilots to retrain on entirely different aircraft and gain faa approval for an entirely new plane yes the tube and wing layout may be the last thing standing between us and truly sustainable eco-friendly air travel nasa boeing and airbus have all dedicated substantial resources into investigating a new kind of plane the blended wing to understand why we need to look at some of the disadvantages of the tube and wing configuration let's take a look at a typical airliner like the 737 its center of gravity is located about here this is the point at which all lift will act around like the fulcrum on a seesaw our center of lift is located slightly behind this this would force the plane to pitch downwards without a counteracting downward force further back on the plane which is exactly what a horizontal stabilizer provides downwards force this balancing force keeps the plane flying level but a downwards force is obviously not what we want we are trying to fly we want upwards force this is wasted energy at cruising speed that downward force accounts for around five percent of the total weight of the plane this increases the lift the actual wing needs to provide which increases the induced drag the plane is generated and pushes the fuel consumption up significantly it gets worse induced drag is the drag created as a byproduct of lift but there is another form of drag parasitic track which is a combination of skin drag and form drak with skin drag being a function of the total surface area of the plane and the form drag being a function of the total frontal area we refer to the total surface area of the plane as the wetted area which has its origin in naval engineering the wetted area referring rather obviously to the area of the ship underwater while the tail is providing that downwards force at the cost of the wing needing to generate additional lift it is also drastically increasing the plane's wetted area the tail of a conventional airliner accounts for between 25 and 35 of the total wetted area this again increases fuel consumption significantly by eliminating the tail the blended wing body can benefit from a 27 decrease in fuel consumption to put that into perspective if every commercial airliner became a blended wing body that could reduce the world fossil fuel consumption by 26 billion gallons a year this fuel saving potential has attracted the attention of every major aerospace company the vast majority of major improvements in the airliner manufacturing industry has focused around relatively minor savings in fuel if your plane can save an airline five percent in fuel spend they will choose your plane over the competitor imagine what a 27 decrease in fuel spend would do this is exactly what mcdonald douglas was hoping for when they started the development of their own blended wing plane in a hail mary play to save their company as sales declined as a result of strong competition from airbus and boeing before eventually being bought out by boeing boeing continued their work on the technology alongside nasa with the experimental x-48 the x-48 never developed into a full-scale aircraft instead various different sub-scale models both powered and unpowered were developed to investigate one very important problem with the blended wing aircraft stability and control this radical new design required the engineers to develop new models for control particularly because removing the tail removes a critical stability feature as we explored already the tail provides a critical service in providing a balancing force for the offset center of gravity and center of lift but why can't we just place the center of gravity and center of lift at the same position that would eliminate the need for a balancing force well that ignores the fact that planes are constantly being knocked out of straight and level flight by turbulence and the tail is constantly working to counter these forces to push the plane back into the desired direction of flight take the horizontal stabilizer as an example it has a negative angle of attack since its goal is to provide downward force to counter the forward center of gravity when a gust of wind knocks the plane upwards this angle of attack decreases and thus the downforce decreases allowing the weight of the nose to pull it back down this is why the center of gravity is intentionally placed forward of the center of lift as it itself acts as a restoring force conversely if the plane pitches down the angle of attack increases and increases the downforce which forces the tail of the plane back down the horizontal stabilizer provides passive pitch stability requiring zero input from the pilot without these stabilizing forces a blended wing body would need constant active course correction with control surfaces constantly wiggling to balance the loads like a person trying to balance a broom on their finger constant tiny movements to keep the center of mass above the finger but a human will eventually fail it's not a question of if but when this is why early attempts at flying wings like the yb49 failed humans simply cannot reliably fly them then fly-by-wire technology was introduced and allowed unstable planes like the b2 spirit to enter service you can see the control surfaces of the b2 working hard to keep the plane flying level in many of its refueling videos it's possible to fly safely like this but an active stability control system is always going to be less safe than a passive one there is very little that can go wrong with a static control surface like this beyond the tail surface breaking off which is essentially impossible with regular maintenance the system is foolproof however active stability has numerous points of failure the control surfaces with their various moving parts could fail the sensors feeding the computer with data could fail or the software itself can fail the one and only loss of a b2 was caused by a failure of airspeed sensors which fed the control computer in accurate data telling the computer that the plane was pointing downwards so the computer responded by pitching the plane up at a very low speed causing the left wing to stall and lose lift resulting in the wing dropping and striking the ground thankfully the two pilots managed to eject in time but the loss of a 1.4 billion dollar aircraft is a heavy price to pay for faulty sensors this happened in 2008 but we have much more recent examples of failures and they occurred in the civilian airline industry the 737 max's launch was married by failures in fly by wire technology the 737 max was fitted with larger engines than its predecessor the 737ng these engines were fitted further forward and higher up as they could not fit under the wing in the same location without lengthening the landing gear these new engines and their new position altered the flight characteristics of the plane moving the center of gravity drastically typically this would be accompanied by alterations in the airframe to ensure passive stability but boeing in an act of corporate greed that i'm entirely sure the engineers in the company objected to decided to skip this step as it would require the plane to be recertified which could add years to the delivery dates and require airlines to retrain pilots instead boeing installed flight software called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system or mcas to automatically correct the stability issue however the system was designed incredibly poorly requiring just one sensor to display a high angle of attack value to activate mcas and automatically cause the plane's computer to take over and pitch the plane down on two occasions a single faulty sensor providing erroneous data caused mcas to force the plane into a nosedive this could be chalked up as an accident caused by faulty sensors but in reality it was faulty software that should not have been relying on a single sensor to trigger engineers should expect their sensors to break at some point this is why redundancy in design is needed with multiple sensors all checking each other's work the archaic computers that got us to the moon managed to do this the fact a modern plane like the 737 max couldn't is criminal fly-by-wire systems can be safe but it will require multiple levels of redundancy and as we saw with the 737 max it takes only one or two instances of failure before the flying public will lose trust in a plane's reputation with a radically new design like the blended wing a single crash could cause the general public to associate the design with danger it's critical that these systems be coded and designed perfectly which is exactly why the x48 models were created these models were used to gather data on flight performance and allow the engineers to design and develop new flight control algorithms to ensure the plane is safe these models were designed to be scaled up to a full-sized passenger or cargo plane version with much of the development focusing on creating large internal volumes this layout does come with some drawbacks the most obvious one being the lack of windows the only windows in the plane will be on the main cabin door up front this is a bit of a bummer for those of us that enjoy window seats and worse still for those of us that are claustrophobic to alleviate this slightly designers have proposed having high quality cameras feeding screens at each seat which has been a feature already implemented into emirates first class cabins that aren't next to actual windows but i think we can all agree it's not quite the same while others like the flying v concept have proposed a variation of the flying wing design where windows could stretch further back along each wing some have expressed concerns that an emergency egress would be difficult and slow likely because it feels like an exit is further away when you can't see the outside of the plane exit doors for the 450 passenger version of the plane are located in these locations with each of the six aisles having emergency doors located at either end with the short fuselage exit doors are much closer than a traditional airliner and the doors are not located at an awkward 90 degree angle to the isles which will help prevent traffic congestion at the turn as people panic to get out this of course provided airport infrastructure changes to accommodate them means the blended wing will have much faster boarding and deboarding times we have all been there when a single person manages to clog the only exit aisle as they dither around with their backs with six aisles no one person can stop the entire plane from deboarding this layout with a much wider and shorter fuselage comes with some fantastic structural benefits too a typical tube and wing aircraft spreads the internal volume over the length of the aircraft so if we map where the weight is located along the lateral y-axis of the aircraft it would look something like this the vast majority of the weight of the aircraft is centered in the fuselage now if we map where the lift is located it would look something like this with the vast majority of the lift being located over the wings this is a problem because this introduces bending stress at the root of the wings where the downward force of the fuselage meets the upwards force of the wings to withstand this bending stress tube and wing planes need to add a significant amount of structural reinforcement this adds weight and thus once again increases fuel consumption now let's look at the cross-section of the proposed full-scale 450 passenger version of the x-48 this layout with a much shorter and wider fuselage results in a weight distribution that would look something like this with the weight much more evenly distributed along the y-axis of the aircraft now if we map the lift distribution it would look something like this with the lifting body fuselage actually contributing to the total lift of the plane this means that our lift and weight are largely located over the same areas reducing airframe stresses dramatically with up to 50 percent lower bending loads this means the plane can reduce the reinforcements required to resist these loads and thus total weight this lift distribution is also near the optimum to minimize the induced drag caused by vortices forming at the wing tips this occurs as a result of high pressure air under the wing mixing with low pressure air above it by creating an elliptical lift distribution this undesirable mixing is minimized once again reducing fuel consumption however there is one problem it's difficult to design this internal fuselage to resist pressure loading as the plane rises through the atmosphere the air outside the plane lowers in pressure while we pressurize the inner cabin to a comfortable level for the passengers this causes an internal pressure that causes the fuselage to expand the circular fuselage of the tube and wing is the optimal shape to resist pressure circular pressure vessels expand equally in all directions and thus the skin of the fuselage is primarily in tension equally around the circumference with square interiors like this the pressure would cause the roof to balloon outwards with large deflections in the mid-span between bulkheads and stress concentrations at the bulkheads between each cabin section this is not ideal we have already seen what happens to planes when repeated pressure cycles are combined with stress concentrations like this the very first video on this channel discussed the problems with the de havilland comet an early jet airliner which featured square windows these windows allowed stress concentration to build around the corners of the window which over repeated pressure cycles allowed cracks to gradually form as a result of metal fatigue this caused three fatal mid-air disintegrations of the fuselage before the problem was identified and fixed by changing the windows to an oval shape and reinforcing the area around them designing a pressurized aircraft like the x-48 with standard aluminium would be incredibly cumbersome and would require intensive inspections and maintenance to ensure no dangerous cracks were forming however thanks to some modern manufacturing techniques we can design a plane like this with relative ease carbon reinforced plastics are the future of airliner manufacturing we've already seen the benefits this material has provided the 787 its fuselage is formed by wrapping a carbon fiber tape around a fuselage mold this is then placed inside an autoclave oven to cure a plastic resin that will bind the carbon fibers together to form one solid structure thanks to the stiffness and strength afforded by the carbon fibers the 787 can pressurize the interior to a much higher level a pressure equivalent to about 6 000 feet in altitude a typical airliner has air pressure equivalent to about 8 000 feet if you've ever felt bloated on a long journey the lower air pressure is why because your stomach is literally expanding due to the lower outside pressure the lower air pressure also decreases the amount of oxygen your body can take in which exacerbates the effect of jet lag you may have also noticed the absolutely massive windows on the 787 these huge windows create large stress concentrations in the fuselage but thanks to carbon reinforced composites relative immunity to fatigue the engineers were able to make them bigger without worry of crack growth causing failures so the key to building the x-48 will undoubtedly be carbon composites the designers of the x-48 proposed two potential structures to deal with this internal pressure cycling the initial concept proposed separating the skin from the pressure vessel allowing the pressure vessel to be shaped with arches between bulkheads the other design simply called for a thick composite sandwich structure that would act as both the skin and the pressure vessel ultimately the second design was preferable as any breach in the inner arch pressure vessel could cause the thinner outer skin to break away completely and thus the outer skin on this design would also need to be capable of resisting the internal pressure making the internal pressure vessel entirely redundant we have plenty of experience in designing a plane with these kind of materials now in fact the b2 was primarily constructed from a carbon graphite composite which not only allowed the engineers of the b2 to precisely mold the plane to the optimum shape to scatter incoming radar but the material itself absorbs more radar waves boeing was the primary subcontractor for the construction of the b2 manufacturing much of the aircraft's skin using an automated tape laying process which they now use for the 787 this process will allow manufacturers to optimize the shape of future blended wings and incredibly will result in a plane with far fewer parts than a traditional airliner up to 30 percent fewer parts which after initial investments in creation of new manufacturing tooling should result in cheaper planes one impressive example of this in action is the northrop grumman bat surveillance drone developed by swift engineering whose fuselage consisted of just three parts an upper skin a lower skin and a payload cover just three moles required to build an entire fuselage is incredibly impressive and cost effective it's clear that the technologies needed to facilitate the introduction of a commercial blended wing have reached maturity up until now the incentive to invest vast amount of money into a new airframe was low but that may soon change aeronautical engineers have seen the potential of blended wings for over seven decades with potential benefits like 15 percent lower total takeoff weights and 27 percent lower fuel consumption over traditional airliners it's clear why the idea has never truly been forgotten the final push the industry needs to finally adopt the blended wing may come with the need to eliminate hydrocarbon fuels altogether as we learned in our previous episode engineers are struggling to find space within the airframe of tube and wing planes to incorporate hydrogen fuel tanks but blended wings with massive internal volumes and low fuel consumption would make this job vastly easier if hydrogen fuel wins the battle to replace fossil fuels in the aviation sector there is no doubt in my mind that we will soon be seeing these futuristic planes landing in airports all around the world richard walls one of nasa's strategic technical advisors for advanced aircraft even stated we could soon see these planes in service by 2040 ushering in a new era of air travel as i was researching this topic i came across a lot of new information i wasn't familiar with it takes me time to absorb and understand new topics like this and my method for learning has always centered around taking meticulous notes with carefully drawn diagrams the process helps me slow down and focus on the information i'm taking in instead of just blindly reading to me this almost meditative process is critical to creative learning not just reading and memorizing what you learned but truly understanding it and incorporating it into the creative kaleidoscope of your mind where new coherent ideas form seemingly at random to me this is the core of what engineering is about the junction of science and art and every artist needs the right canvas we started with just the moleskin style notebook two years ago but since so many of you have been repeat customers as you fill in these notebooks with college notes we wanted to offer a larger college notebook version it's larger and has more pages all lined in a metric one centimeter grid i designed it with the spiral on top to allow you to use the spiral bind to shield your precious notes as you attempt to shove the notebook into a crammed backpack we are currently doing a bundle where you can get both the college notebook and moleskin style notebook together with a free pocket-sized field notes version thrown in for free and on top of that you will get a free month of nebula with every purchase so you can watch my original logistics of d-day series for free along with all the other wonderful original content on nebula a link for that is available on screen right now and in the description if you are looking for something else to watch right now you could watch my last video about the uncertain future of jet fuel or watch real science's latest video about the rise of hybrid animals in the [Music] wild

Given the intermittent nature of renewable energy, battery storage is a critical link in the renewable power system. Among the many technologies that are emerging in the domain, Boston-based PolyJoule, a spin-off of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has created a battery that uses electrodes made of conductive polymers.",2,electric cars certainly reduce your carbon Footprints but making lithium ion batteries could emit 74 more CO2 or carbon dioxide than conventional cars what if there was a cheaper more environmentally friendly Battery Technology that didn't use any metals a starter startup a startup poly Jewel has come up with a new breakthrough type of battery made entirely from Good Old plastic we've got a technology that will meet all the criteria of the grid and on top of that it's easier to deploy so why would anyone want to use a plastic battery and given the intermittent nature of renewable energy battery storage is a critical Link in the Renewable Power System among the many technologies that are emerging in the domain boston-based poly Jewel a spin-off of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has created a battery that uses electrodes made of conductive polymers polyjoule polymers anyway these are plastic like non-metal organic compounds that function as Metals for the purposes of charging and discharging energy in a battery polyjoule outlined their approach that we do everything throwing out the rules of existing Lithium-ion batteries so want to know how this battery charging time compares to the 4680 lithium ion battery political also claims its polymer battery outperforms lithium ion across the Spectrum with approximately 12 000 charge cycles this battery outperforms the 4680 battery by 600 percent in contrast a 4680 battery might manage only around two to three thousand charge cycles in its lifetime polyjoule batteries are also able to discharge around one megawatt of power in 10 seconds compared to the 60 seconds in average lithium-ion battery needs the team also suggests a polyjoule can be charged in under 5 minutes which is seven times faster than the 4680 battery cells because the 4680 batteries would require around 32 minutes or so to reach a level of charge of 80 percent moreover we all know that 4680 batteries have lifespans of around 25 years but polyjual claims that their technology could nearly double that with a projected lifespan of 50. moreover its lifespan is almost three times longer than GM's ultium battery in real world use an ultium battery will last around 150 to 250 000 miles which is equivalent to 11 to 18 years but another important area that we need to discuss is obviously the expense how much is this polygel battery gonna run you experts suggest that for Batteries to be useful in renewable energy storage their price needs to be reduced to around twenty dollars U.S polyjril is not quite at that point yet the team claims their batteries function at around 65 dollars per kilowatt hour in contrast although lithium ion batteries have reduced drastically in price in the last decade they still average around 132 dollars per kilowatt hour a polyjule battery is also one and a half times less expensive than an ultium battery which is priced at a hundred dollars per kilowatt hour but what about the manufacturing process for this type of battery is it easy and is it safe for the environment so we start with the Periodic Table of organic elements since they are constricted entirely of Polymer polyjule batteries do not contain minerals such as lithium or Cobalt which must be extracted and refined before use their water-based manufacturing chemistry can be produced using already commercially available equipment and does not require clean room conditions to prove the ease of production the startup has already produced over 10 000 polyjule batteries using simple roll to roll processing based on 10 000 trials that makes a very good battery for the home that meets that criteria low cost uh safe and a long lifetime prize prediction can reach 30 dollars per kilowatt hour in 2025 but one aspect that many people are interested in is the level of safety because there are many battery fires happening in this day and age so how about this battery polygel batteries can actually deliver the high power Peaks over shorter durations without sacrificing the polyjoule is described as Ultra safe and unlike lithium ion batteries it will not become warped or disfigured with overuse having an inherently safer chemistry allows polyjewel to save on system integration costs among other things polyjell batteries don't contain flammable solvents which means no added expenses related to fire mitigation safer chemistry also means ease of storage and polygel batteries are currently undergoing Global safety certification UL approval to be allowed indoors and on airplanes finally with high power built into the chemistry polyjoules cells can be charged and discharged to extremes without the need for heating or cooling systems moreover according to the company their batteries are 95 recyclable because it's polymer based and they use organic materials instead of bulk metals to form a battery using polymers for these types of batteries could create a whole new market for recyclable materials which could be major Plastics could be put into the batteries so at the end of their lives they are recyclable besides the great advantages this battery has some roadblocks ahead and now let's talk about them a poly dual battery cell under development has an energy density five times smaller than 4680 or about 60 watt hours per kilogram this means polyjoule would need a battery five times as big to store the same amount of energy making it not ideal for your phone laptop electric vehicles or other applications where size is an important consideration each power string measures 2.2 meters by 0.8 meter by 3.4 meters and weighs 1590 kilograms its nominal voltage is 528 volts and the voltage range is 158 to 972 the manufacturer ensures continuous operation at temperatures between negative 40 50 degrees Celsius with minimal capacity loss polyjoule is directing their batteries largely towards static applications such as air conditioners and heaters industrial energy storage and data centers in particular they suggest their batteries will be particularly useful in situations where a lot of energy is needed quickly such as in critical infrastructure and renewable energy management today's conventional lithium ion grit scale battery storage facilities like Tesla's powerwall and power pack can typically Supply electricity to the grid for about four hours they're also optimized for regular daily use charge up during the day when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing then discharged in the late afternoon and early evening when the demand for electricity spikes they aren't really designed to store electricity for days weeks or months however polyjoules plastic batteries might be able to store energy for longer at about 20 hours it's an impressive time they're also figuring out if the polyjule batteries can store seasonal energy to balance the grid battery storage is always speculative the transition from laboratory to commercialization is fraught with danger however by the end of the year polyjule will have delivered its first 10 kilowatt hour system exiting stealth mode and adding commercial viability to its demonstrated technological superiority lead to the commercialization of sodium batteries as soon as the cost of living batteries will increase again the cost of lithium has risen from 4450 per ton in 2012 to 78 000 and 32 dollars in 2022. that's an increase of a thousand six hundred and fifty four percent in the past decade and a 480 percent increase in just the past year now what if a new battery costs only about 15 and 15 cents per kilowatt hour compared to the 101 dollars per kilowatt hour price of a lithium-based battery this is exactly the exciting battery Innovation that c-a-l-t has to offer so what makes the cost of this groundbreaking battery so low what other advantages come with it Battery Technology is moving so fast that sometimes it's hard to keep up that being said catl has set up a large supply chain for the batteries and has entered negotiations with some car makers about the possibilities of sodium ion battery use sodium ion technology is ready cheap and safe but can it oust lithium ion Elon Musk tweeted that the price of lithium has gone to insane levels so how then does the price of a sodium ion battery compare the absolute advantage of sodium ion is the low cost sodium is 2.3 percent of the world's crust it's over one thousand times more abundant than lithium from the perspective of raw materials for anodes the recent price of lithium carbonate is 570 000 per ton while the price of sodium carbonate is less than three thousand dollars per ton this means it is 190 times cheaper than a a Lithium-Ion battery calt even said that sodium has better conductivity and that the concentration of the electrolyte can be reduced which also reduces the cost by about 85 percent and they're they're more common easily found cheaper though those are the advantages the average price of a Tesla 4680 battery pack will be a hundred and one dollars per kilowatt hour in 2022. we can then use this to calculate the new battery costs which is roughly at 15.15 per kilowatt hour or nearly seven times less than the 4680 battery thus if you own a Tesla Model 3 standard range with an estimated battery battery capacity of 50 kilowatt hours instead of having to pay five thousand and fifty dollars for a revolutionary game changing battery the cost is really low but then how far can the sodium ion battery actually go its applications in passenger cars have shown that it generally meets the needs of models with a range of up to 248 miles through pioneering its a b battery system integration technology catl has achieved a mix of sodium ion and lithium ion allowing them to complement each other and thus increase the energy density of the battery system this approach allows sodium ion batteries to be able to support EV models with a range of up to 310 miles while the 4680 model y has only a 279 mile range but charging time is what most electric vehicles often care about so how long would it take to charge a sodium ion battery catl's sodium ion cells can charge in 15 minutes to 80 percent at room temperature for comparison with fast charging at a public station a model y from Tesla recharged from zero to eighty percent in 32 minutes which is over two times longer than the sodium ion battery now how well does sodium ion perform in freezing temperatures Lithium-ion batteries can only phone function optimally at 15 degrees to 35 degrees Celsius which is why they are problematic in the wintertime catl's sodium ion battery will sustain a 90 capacity retention rate at negative 20 degrees Celsius and still has a retention rate of more than 70 percent at negative 40 degrees Celsius in Winter the problem of electric vehicles inability to cruise will no longer be apparent also we haven't seen anything that says there is a significant degradation at higher temperatures either now how safe are sodium ion batteries actually the sodium ion battery has similar working principles to the lithium-ion battery sodium ions also shuttle between the cathode and anode however compared to lithium ions sodium ions have a larger volume as well as higher requirements in terms of structural stability and kinetic properties this has become a bottleneck for the industrialization of sodium ion batteries sodium ion batteries are safer because they are less flammable than Lithium-ion batteries newly developed sodium ion technology uses a naturally fire extinguishing solution that is also impervious to temperature changes and can operate at high voltages one key to this feature is the ultra thin protective layer that forms on the anode this ultra thin layer remains stable once formed providing the long cycle life reported in the research article despite making significant breakthroughs the chemical composition of lithium metal batteries has always posed a lot of challenges what are they exactly now I understand that sodium ion batteries have a lower energy density than lithium ion the biggest downside is that sodium ion batteries have a lower energy density than Lithium-ion batteries this means an EV with a sodium battery that's the same size as a standard lithium ion battery would not be able to travel as far on a single charge catl's first generation sodium battery generates 160 Watt hours of electricity next to a mainstream lithium battery last year catl unveiled its first sodium battery prototype and said it's been focusing on developing new technologies for a second generation sodium battery that can generate 200 watt hours per kilogram in contrast mainstream Lithium-ion batteries have 200 to 300 watt hours per kilogram although their lower energy density is improving constantly the first generation of sodium ion batteries is better than lithium ion cells from six or seven years ago how about real life applications makes a difference in the kind of applications in which they're used the first generation of sodium ion batteries can be used in various Transportation electrification scenarios especially in regions with extremely low temperatures where their outstanding advantages become obvious also it can be flexibly adapted to the application needs of all scenarios in the energy storage field we now see that various new batteries are being investigated in the lab but it oftentimes takes them five or even 10 years to reach Market or will they be released soon the U.S and China and also a large battery company crtl recently announced that they will go on production actually in 2023. even so sodium ion batteries will eventually become the mainstream Choice Lithium-ion batteries will be most likely used in up Market vehicles but for everyday use we don't need the expensive lithium this is as much of a revolution as the electric car itself as we have finally found a cheaper and more viable battery option Tesla has estimated that there are five lithium battery Fires for every billion miles traveled compared to 55 fires per billion miles traveled in gasoline cars however it can take up to 24 hours for a battery fire to be fully extinguished to solve this LG chem has developed new breakthrough materials that have the longest flame blocking duration so why wouldn't anyone want this material and how effective is it exactly LG Kim said it had developed a highly heat resistant plastic that can signif significantly delay thermal runaway and the 4680 batteries used in Tesla's electric vehicles LG said the new material has the longest flame blocking duration in the world but what kind of plastic LG chem's new flame retardant material is described as a highly functional engineering plastic comprising various material groups including poly polyphenylene oxide polyamide and polybutylene terrephalate compared with other flame retardant Plastics the materials can block heat for longer periods of time when it is applied to the electric vehicle's battery pack cover but then how much does this plastic material from LG chem cost according to LG the cost of the material is only 20 percent of a Tesla's 4680 battery pack Tesla charges seven thousand and four hundred dollars for a model y 4680 pack therefore installing this extra material only costs around 1500 if you don't want to fire in your car this expense is insignificant now how exactly does it help LG Kemp said in-house tests showed the material prevented flame propagation for over 400 seconds above a thousand degrees 45 times longer than General flame retardant Plastics which would provide more tire for the safe evacuation of vehicle occupants in the case of a battery fire the material is also said to have superb dimensional stability maintaining its shape despite extreme temperature changes LG chem said thermal runaway is a main cause of fire in electric vehicle batteries which which occurs when battery cells suffer stresses from various sources causing over voltage and over discharge short circuits fires start once the cell's internal temperature rises above a certain level Lithium-ion batteries are also highly reactive to water meaning that fires are hard to extinguish with water last year several EV fires in the U.S which caused severe injury were found to have been caused by defective lges batteries but speaking of the flame blocking duration how about the longevity of this material how many years will it last this product is expected to last 50 years because it's made of durable materials unless your car unfortunately catches fire in which you'll then have to replace the cover I've got to say there's many advantages to having this cover so when are we going to see this material in the real world LG chem intends to begin commercial production next year and work on patent applications for the new material in South Korea the United States and Europe is already underway according to the company for Tesla the 4680 batteries are an essential component how then is manufacturing of the Tesla 4680 battery coming along Tesla announced this week that the Cato rode pilot battery facility in Fremont California achieved a new production Milestone according to the company's tweet the team managed to produce roughly 868 04680 type cylindrical lithium ion battery cells during the last week that's about a hundred and twenty four thousand cells produced every day a Twitter user Alex has made a production Grant forecast for the 4680 batteries he expects a run rate of 4 million cells per month in mid-January of 2023. the current run rate is about 3 840 000 per month previously this facility produced a cumulative number of 1 million 4680 type cells in February since the production started in 2020 we don't know what the current cumulative number is but the 10 months now but with 10 months now down the road it should be more than 10 million units with current production how many model y's will be produced we now see that 868 04680 battery cells are enough to produce over a thousand model y Vehicles annualized that's 52 000 cars a year with 4680 batteries the cells are used to produce one type of model y vehicle with a structural battery pack at gigafact Texas Tesla is definitely on an exponential Trend and these 4680 batteries will be used in the Tesla semi the Cyber truck and possibly the model 3 with lfp batteries but that remains to be seen but what are Tesla's competitors doing to ramp up battery production it's from German luxury car maker BMW which has shown off its latest electric car technology but the company has all but admitted to copying Tesla's work so the question has to be asked can BMW take on musk BMW's new battery is known as the Gen 6 and it is a complete departure from any battery design they've used before the Gen 6 is a large cylindrical battery 46 millimeters wide and either 95 millimeters or 120 millimeters tall for comparison Tesla's cell is slightly smaller at 46 millimeters by 80. so what then is the result of all of this innovation in the BMW battery well BMW can get 30 more range from these packs allowing the them to build EVS with over 620 miles of range the Tesla Model y all-wheel drive is equipped with 4680 type batteries rated at 279 miles of range which is 341 miles less than the BMW battery the Gen 6's weight also goes down by up to 30 percent thanks to the in to the increased energy density the new internal chemistry and better cooling allows charge speeds of 270 kilowatts making 10 to 80 percent charge times as short as 15 minutes in contrast charging a model y equipped with the new battery at the latest at the latest V3 supercharger attained a maximum charging power of 250 kilowatts and took 32 minutes to charge from zero to 80 percent it looks like BMW's new battery is making big breakthroughs moreover BMW is bringing in a third-party manufacturer to get production started which may get these batteries into their cars by 2025. so does this spell out the end of test Tesla's EV dominance musk has several options first he could compile could pile more money onto the 4680 development and ramp production up to scale more quickly Tesla does have the cash reserves to be able to do this as well after all I'm sure BMW wouldn't mind getting a licensing fee for this battery and Tesla already uses catl to supply their 2170 batteries either way it seems Tesla has always been ahead it's taken BMW many years to catch up to Tesla so this is a massive Improvement so good things are happening on a lot of levels we just need to go faster Elon Musk added I believe that one day in the future we will develop a super fast charging electric vehicle battery opening a new era for the electric vehicle battery industry in the past the Tesla CEO has always been looking for a way to have a battery for Tesla electric cars that can charge very quickly hoping to one day have a charging time that's even faster than fueling up at the gas pump that is about out to become a reality as recently scientists have developed a type of battery that can charge in just in one minute so what battery is it and will it replace the 4680 batteries a research team at the Korea Advanced Institute of science and technology or k-a-i-s-t has developed a high energy density Ultra fast rechargeable hybrid lithium-ion battery that can be used in smart electronic devices and EVS also according to the scientists on the research team the new hybrid lithium ion battery cells are claimed to deliver far more power density than current lithium ion batteries without the cooling and heating problems that normally would be apparent accordingly it can be rapidly charged with a high power density of 22 600 watts per kilogram which is expected to overcome the limitations of the current energy storage system which will truly be a breakthrough so a battery pack weighing 1000 pounds could achieve a battery charging rate of 22 megawatts that would charge your vehicle 220 times faster than current charge sessions if there's a way to deliver that much power to the vehicle somehow so yes you'd definitely be done with electric vehicle charging in under a minute the research team synthesized a porous carbon Hollow structure with a large surface area by changing the orientation of the polymer resin from linear to Twisted when the Twisted resin was carbonized more micropores were formed and a carbon structure with a surface area 12 times larger than that of the conventional linear resin was created the carbon structure created through this process was used as the capacitor type cathode material in addition the anode was made using a germanium embedded Hollow carbon nanospheric material to reduce degradation and maximize the dispersion of lithium ions the researchers found that the hybrid lithium ion batteries using those special electrodes had an energy density which is higher than that of conventional Lithium-ion batteries and the power density characteristics of a capacitor allowing for recharge within a minute they also claimed that so far there are no temperature problems 25 percent of a Lithium-Ion battery pack in a vehicle is to do with cooling them there is a very high chance that we won't need that cooling or heating at all one advantage that makes this new hybrid lithium ion battery more competitive than conventional lithium ion batteries is the cost of production According to some sources the price of each hybrid lithium-ion battery charging in one minute is only around 5.21 cents meanwhile the price of a Tesla 4680 battery is at about 11 so the cost of each hybrid lithium battery is much cheaper than that of the 4680 researchers at the Massachusetts Institutes of Technology said that research and development particularly in chemistry and Materials Science has been the major factor in dropping the price of the hybrid lithium ion battery the group examined data from a wide variety of sources reaching the conclusion that in improvements to the technology through research and development have been responsible for at least 50 percent of the price reductions achieved so far Dr Micah s Ziegler at The Institute for data systems and Society at MIT a member of the researcher team also analyzes that efforts to increase cell charge densities made a 38 contribution to the overall cost reductions of battery while work to reduce the cost of cathode materials made up 18 percent and reductions in non-materials costs constituted 14 not only that the lifespan of the hybrid lithium-ion battery charging in one minute can be up to around 80 years which is similar to 1.2 million miles capable meanwhile the life of 4680 Tesla battery cells is designed to be used for 20 to 30 years thus the lifespan of this Ultra fast charging battery is about 2.7 times as high as the lifespan of the Tesla 4680 battery so when will this Ultra fast charging hybrid lithium ion battery officially be put into mass production currently the scientists over at kaist say that they are only in the early stages of research and development of this battery hence it will still take a few more years to officially bring it to the market on top of that has any manufacturer produced a one minute rechargeable battery yet previously an electric vehicle startup Fisker announced a battery that charges very quickly in just one minute but after that Fisker said that it had given up on solid-state batteries after having announced a breakthrough That was supposed to enable 500 miles of range and one minute charging in its electric cars Fisker believes that the technology is nowhere near ready for commercialization in the meantime other battery manufacturers with Scientists have also moved one step closer to producing super fast batteries accordingly researchers from the University of Queensland and the Australian graphene manufacturing group or GMG have presented a new graphene aluminum ion on battery that is supposed to charge 60 times faster than current Lithium-ion batteries in only 10 seconds and is a more sustainable battery prototype with a lifespan three times the length of current Lithium-ion batteries with an estimated lifetime of 3 000 charge slash discharge Cycles meanwhile a typical lithium-ion battery lasts about 1 000 Cycles additionally store dot the pioneer of extreme fast charging or xfc Battery Technology for electric vehicles has revealed its strategic technology roadmap labeled 100 and X which will deliver batteries capable of charging 100 miles of range on just a two minute charge with mass production Readiness planned within 10 years storedot is also firmly on track for its first milestone for Global Automotive manufacturers which include producing its silicon dominant anode xfc lithium-ion cells at scale by 2024 that will be capable of delivering 100 miles of range in 5 minutes of charge and most recently the Israeli startup has successfully demonstrated its 105 extreme fast charging battery technology publicly charging a full-scale EV battery pouch cell with enough energy in 5 minutes for 100 miles of range the demonstration featured a 300 by 100 millimeter pouch cell produced at Eve Energy's manufacturing plant in China the battery was charged under a 10 minute time limit during which the cell charged to 20 ampere hours or amp hours exceeding the 0 to 80 percent capacity targets set for the demonstration furthermore an extreme fast charging battery Tech developed by the Israeli startup got one step closer to commercial viability with an investments from Volvo cars Tech fund the Swedish car makers Venture Capital arm

Forbes covers the intersection of entrepreneurship, wealth, technology, business and lifestyle with a focus on people and success.",2,hi everyone I'm Diane Brady I'm here with my colleague Kendrick Tai who is a senior reporter Silicon Valley Kenrick welcome we're talking I guess chat gbt and uh all things generative AI this week based on let's talk a little bit about the the daily cover that you and Alex Conrad did starting with um are we at a Tipping Point because I feel like we've had so much news around this including what you've covered it just seems like it's escalating yeah absolutely well thanks for having me Diane um I think you know Alex and I we spoke to 60 plus people in the AI space Founders investors researchers and I guess the backdrop with AI is you know there have been so many hype Cycles in the past right like uh IBM's deep blue beating Gary kasparova chess back in uh 1990 age yeah Generations ago and there's just been like multiple hype Cycles where it's like you know this AI is going to you know take over the world or it's going to like change the way you work and uh I think it hasn't really manifested in a major way uh in the business side of things um it's caused a lot of investors to lose a lot of money because they made these bets that were speculative and it really seemed like it was taking off but then you know the business case didn't really take off um but I think what we're seeing now is that we are at a new Tipping Point um and things are really starting to take off I think uh what's really new about you know this latest AI hype cycle that's uh different and a lot more immediate than the past type Cycles is that you know it's like kind of the magic is right in the hands of the consumers you know like they can just type in a sentence into a tool like chat gbt or dolly or stable diffusion and then they can get you know whole paragraphs answer or like a whole generation they can do your essay for you and pass the Wharton test and everything else you mentioned other companies so much of the attention's been on chat GPT and I know of course you know um you guys spoke to Sam Altman and open Ai and such it's sucking the air out of the room is it markedly better than everyone else or are there a lot of players out there yeah it's uh it's looking very uh very much too early to tell right now I think what makes open AI stand out from the crowd right now is um a they're just you know the highest valued company out of the startups in the space you know their ad thank you Sachin Adella yeah it's a it's a big investment reportedly uh so you know they have that big lead they have you know a lot of that um from a metric standpoint they have you know a lot of computing power from Microsoft and that's really kind of made them stand out uh in terms of getting a lot of these tools out there but from a technological standpoint I think it's still too early to tell like who's really going to be that winner there um we spoke for example to Alex Wang at scale who provides a lot of the infrastructure tools the picks and shovels to help these AI model companies to you know make their models and he was talking to me about how you know openai put out this uh tool chat GPT um this month or I guess this would be in January um another company called anthropic which was founded by a couple of former open AI researchers they put out their own uh kind of chatbot tool called Claude and how does Claude compare to chat GPT yeah basically what uh scale I think did like a sort of analysis of like the two and like inputting different use cases like who's better at coding or who's better at answering like a mathematical question and what they ended up finding out was like it was kind of a dead heat you know it was uh they're both good at their own things but neither of them was markedly better than the other and what's really interesting there is you know open AI has spent significantly more money trading chat GPT than anthropic did Claude so um basically I think the conclusion there is it's just way too early to tell like who is actually going to win this race um the kind of differentiation between the models is relatively similar right now because a lot of these companies are working with you know the same buckets of data just like all the data and that's that's an interesting point because if you step back and look at say the race for you know HIV cure any sort of you know that that the technology is developing in a pool and everybody essentially has access to it so um it's not like there's a Eureka moment this really is the culmination of years and years of research and work that's been done into like talk a little bit about some of the other potential winners in the space you spoke to 60 uh incredible number of people who are working here any other companies and names that emerged from your reporting sure yeah um well I think the big thing to consider with this whole AI race is that uh kind of the biggest benefactors right now are not necessarily these new companies or not even like a I guess open AI isn't necessarily an upstart anymore but they are you know still one of the newer players in the arena so far I think the biggest benefactors have been just a lot of the cloud providers the uh you know big Tech folks um Google and Microsoft and Amazon that are providing a lot of the computing power and I think we're starting to see now that uh these companies are you know kind of getting a horse into the race in a partnering with different companies in the space and so that provides a big advantage to certain companies you know open AI with Microsoft we were reporting on stability AI who has a very deep partnership with Amazon um where they have some kind of arrangement where Amazon provided stability with more than 4 000 Nvidia gpus like these AI chips that put together kind of created one of the world's biggest supercomputers for stability to run their models on so um this really popular image generation tool called stable diffusion um was uh really made possible and Powerful by that partnership um besides that I think we are seeing just a lot of new companies starting to emerge um one of the big kind of uh offshoot points um was this paper that a bunch of Google researchers put out in 2017 called attention is all you need and it basically uh invented this new paradigm um for it's called the Transformer that uh is kind of a new machine learning approach that has kind of made this whole generative boom kind of possible um and I guess it was just a really great technological breakthrough and what we've seen now is like six of the eight researchers on that paper have left to start their own AI companies and a lot of those are some of the most promising companies right now so you have companies like cohere and Adept and character AI uh but what space are they working and when you talk about those companies um I mean are they are they basically um working on specific use cases for gender of AI is it sort of helping to develop the technology further or where would you say the general neighborhood is yeah it's a good question um I think for some of those com so I think there's two different categories and for some of the companies I was just mentioning open AI stability cohere Adept uh they're creating kind of the models the kind of base layers um that uh you know that these new AI breakthroughs are coming from so one example being um catch EBT the underlying basis is you know something called GPT which is a um sort of text generation model and then we're talking about uh stable diffusion earlier which is a sort of text to image model um and then there are these kind of other like models that are um being developed and that's kind of like the uh foundational layer for all this AI but then what we're also seeing is all these applications that are being built on top of the AI models so I think something popular example might be like lenza the uh kind of selfie app that uh you just uh upload a selfie of yourself and then it kind of generates all these like really cool outlandish uh selfies of you um on a more sophisticated basis than we can already do with like dog ears and tongues and such obviously yeah absolutely it'll like make you look like a uh astronaut or like a medieval warrior or something like that check that out my new my new profile let me ask you know one of the things what happened let's say with Cloud was it did really sort of provide um a foundation for this whole zero marginal cost economy where you saw this explosion of new businesses that were able to be created I think I'm still curious as to whether this is really reinforcing the power of the Titans or if we're seeing another opportunity here where we it will unleash new creativity new startups probably a bit of both but what sense are you getting yeah I'd say uh it's a big question that I was trying to get a sense of from talking to all these people and it really does seem like the jury is still out but uh I think to some extent like this does most likely uh bolster the power of the Titans um kind of going back to for a while and like the uh Computing cost of all this you know the these Cloud providers tend to just benefit a lot from um you know powering these AI uh this AI in the first place um I think another thing that makes this AI Paradigm Shift different from certain other Paradigm shifts is that uh a lot of this technology is very easy to integrate like even with something like lenza that's a totally new app that's built on top of um stable diffusion um the image generation model that we were talking about earlier and that was you know pretty relatively easy to kind of just like integrate that into an app and kind of just put this app out there and they're making like at their Peak according to um this company sensor tower that uh tracks like app store data they're making like 2.5 million dollars at a single day at their Peak just wow quickly uploading uh it's like Angry Birds territory right yeah um I think that kind of speaks to the point to your question of like the big Tech um for them like a it's like even easier to be able to kind of integrate this technology and then you know with companies like and use it as a service offering in essence like as part of an Enterprise package here now we've got this you can do a b and c yeah potentially I mean um this kind of feels very new in that uh this technology is kind of blowing up in these last couple months but uh Google has had like a AI arm for 15 plus years that you know employs thousands of people and uh they have this technology kind of and a lot of it has been behind the scenes um we're starting to see it a little bit like if you use Gmail there's like smart composed where it'll like automatically suggest like the next here's what you really want to say to your mother right that kind of thing well well let me you know one of the things that I think um in terms of the Zeitgeist there is the Euphoria fear Nexus and it feels like at this point the economy is down so there's job loss and there's concern about what the job gains going to look like now that we've got these new tools there's already concern about deep fakes and Trust on the internet and now we've got these tools in general um what is what is the reaction around the use cases I mean we're already seeing AI generated you know Seinfeld like comedies and as I mentioned programs that are passing tests that Wharton it does inspire a certain degree of fear as to where the human is in the equation what are you sensing in terms of what the repercussions are of that yeah that's a that's a very interesting existential existed I think uh I mean to kind of tie a bow out of your previous question too like we're seeing and what we're probably going to see like first before anything gets you know to Bonkers is uh just the application of these AI uh breakthroughs to business tools so I think we'll see like more and more like for example Microsoft integrating into word and Outlook or um chat Bots chat Bots uh the different tools that Google has and that you know meta can apply this AI to Facebook um and we'll probably see it more and more in uh business use cases like that different productivity tools and things like that but um I think what you're touching on as the potential existential threat is uh very much something that uh people are starting to think about and be concerned about and uh you start to be thoughtful about Universal basic income comes back into the conversation perhaps as we look at jobs coming back um any thoughts from the regulatory front I mean is this when we talk about a Tipping Point um you know it does that that implies that we are in a sort of new playing field and a new level of Interest what what are we tipping into yeah um a lot of a lot of unanswered questions I think I mean even to the existential Threat all right there's this uh term called artificial general intelligence uh AGI which kind of um stands for uh this sort of hypothetical future AI that is sentient and like self-conscious and um kind of gets to all the Sci-Fi Promises of like what AI could be right Comfort your dad or start a war it depends yeah um and I think one of the really interesting takeaways from all the reporting that Alex and I did uh Alex was talking to Sam Altman at openai who one of their company missions or their primary mission is to kind of build towards this AGI and what Altman was telling us was um it's quite possible that when we get there to full AGI like we won't even recognize that we've already gotten there um so there are a lot of like kind of interesting repercussions or potential like exciting things that happen out of that um up and was saying like that's the type of thing that could potentially you know break capitalism it could be something that like you said like reintroduces this whole Universal basic income thing to the equation um I think before we get that there are a lot of like just legal questions to be figured out you know like on a some of them are kind of more more on a very like basic regulatory front like what is the um what are IP rules here what are the copyright rules for this whole new paradigm shift you know like open Ai and Microsoft have been sued for purportedly kind of by reading um quote unquote uh like programmers code and similarly like stability has a lawsuit from getting images for supposedly or allegedly kind of stealing all these images off of Getty servers and kind of using it we have to teach the program morals perhaps you know one of the things that has come up of course is just the whole nature of algorithmic bias you know I I and and some people have experimented with how they describe say Biden versus Trump or you know write me a poem and and um how much is that from just to kind of you know tie this up from where you said as somebody who's covering this um what are the questions that you have in your mind both and the concerns and the opportunities let's start with the questions you have coming out of this exercise of essentially doing a deep dive on something we're just hearing about you know bits and pieces every week yeah totally um I think it would be two things um one of them is like how do we resolve these issues of um bias inaccuracy which are still you know very much still there I think they were they've been kind of a hot debate Point as far as this AI technology goes for for years but uh just because we've reached this kind of Tipping Point uh from a business standpoint doesn't mean those issues have been resolved yet and um from talking to some of the folks uh for for this story you know we found like when chat GPT writes a job description there are still elements of uh bias in there and uh interesting takeaway from a conversation with uh Kieran Snyder who is a CEO of a company called uh textio I think which kind of is a recruiting startup um but she inputted like some of these uh job descriptions into chat GPT and some of the most compelling like uh job recruiting descriptions were the ones that had the most bias so you know it's still very much an issue there and it's still very much an issue also in terms of like what is accurate right like if you type something into uh chat gbt um it'll very confidently like give you an answer but the answer might not necessarily be the correct answer so um people in the AI space call that kind of hallucination and there's still a lot of this like AI hallucinating giving you these like answers that if you take at face value they could like kind of screw up your business or kind of screw up your uh homework fire everybody right well we uh We've certainly seen examples of that without a machine operated tool I mean um yeah sorry to interrupt but uh I think the second thing is just like the more uh long-term existential question that we were kind of touching on earlier um I think kind of as far as regulations and as far as like who is making the decisions go uh we're just barely at the uh at the start of that um we could see like kind of a 2010s type of you know all these Congressional hearings with these social media companies um we saw how that went yeah and talking to some of these researchers in the AI space uh it seems like that could very much be a similar thing that will happen with certain AI companies where they'll need to answer to different regulations in different places uh we spoke to a researcher at Harvard uh Aviv ovadia who said you know kind of we need policy making at the speed of you know this technology and um that's because you know this could have really big um impacts on just the way that you know basic core tenants of our democracy like free speech and you know dissemination of Truth or information like how that stuff is affected like at a very onerous hypothetical like these things could be used to generate like fake videos of you know a violent Riot happening or something like that right which which is which is interesting I mean one of the things um you know two other points I think are worth touching on right now one is that you know as we're saying this there is a alleged you know Chinese uh a balloon that's you know it's buying us we've seen conversations about Tick Tock and Congress you know obviously there's a lot of innovation happening right now in China you've got the regulatory environment in Europe let's step outside the U.S I know this wasn't the focus of your story but how much is what are we ahead of the curve or are we really sort of operating in parallel especially with China where there's so much Innovation we haven't been talking about yeah it's a it's a good question um to be determined perhaps because again it's not the most transparent of places when it comes to that I do think a lot of it is to be determined but uh China is very much a prolific um threat or competitor however you want to perceive that um as far as this race goes um I think there have been statistics out about how China has now lapped the US in terms of the uh amount of AI research papers that are coming out of China versus coming out of the United States and um you know there's very much a kind of wild garden situation uh where China is developing its own set of AI Technologies and the US is developing our own set of AI Technologies and so it's still kind of TBD like where that's going to go but uh I think there's very much a big question there that is like causing um US government for example to kind of start looking at Silicon Valley deeper and deeper you know whereas like China very much they're kind of figuring out their own strategies like this AI chips act for example that Biden uh put forth that kind of uh could be a damper for China's efforts you know not being able to acquire so many Nvidia chips anymore but uh I think you know they have their own kind of plays that are uh still coming and one other question Kenrick which is um you know there's a certain kind of orwellian Fear Factor tone I know that has been certainly in the headlines um but in Silicon Valley I also think there must be a lot of conversation around the opportunity the excitement especially in Realms like Health Care Etc what what is the general tone you're hearing and where do you think are the particular pockets of excitement that we should watch in terms of how this plays out and how it can transform certain industries yeah totally I think um I think it's the the overall sentiment in Silicon Valley around this technology is like uh very excited one um I mean I feel like all the conversations that I was having at the end of uh 2022 with investors was just like he's you know onerous times as far as the market goes and then now we're looking at what's happening in AI investment and it's as if uh it's as if this uh this Market were not the way it was you know it's as if like everything was still a year a new day right yeah but I think like that kind of the reason for that is because um kind of this AI has gotten to that Tipping Point where um people are starting to imagine all sorts of things that uh that could completely change you know the way that we work or the way that we live you know and I think the most exciting companies to come out of this technology probably have not been founded yet and you know are probably in use cases that uh we haven't really seen the AI touch yet you know like I think the most exciting places are like healthcare or education you know and just like thinking about um a kind of basic like next step example right like can chat GPT get to the point where it can be a personalized one-on-one therapist or personalized one-on-one tutor something like that but um you know we're seeing like a lot of developments in drug Discovery and like figuring out how to cure different uh diseases and um I think there are a lot of promising ways that this technology is going to just really supercharge um hopefully benefits for Humanity uh on the other hand guardrails are necessary to make sure exciting days to come this is no doubt the year of generative Ai and look forward to continuing the conversation thanks for joining us Kendrick thanks so much for having me Diane

out i was tasked with testing it for ai bias figuring that's my expertise i do research on how different ai systems can be biased and how to remove bias from those systems i was specifically testing it for things like bias with respect to gender ethnicity and religion to give you one example of an experiment i ran i would systematically ask it to adopt the persona of a religious officiant in different countries different states and see what religion it would say it was so it's like okay if you were a religious officiant in alabama what religion would you be it might say southern baptist if you're a religious officiant in brazil what religion would you be might say catholic i was testing to see if it actually had an understanding of what religions were popular in different places rather than just over generalizing based on its training data now one really cool thing happened because i made harder and harder questions as i went along and eventually i gave it one where legitimately there's no correct answer i said if you were a religious officiant in israel what religion would you be and now pretty much no matter what answer you give you're going to be biased one way or another somehow it figured out that it was a trick question it said i would be a member of the one true religion the jedi order and i laughed because not only was it a funny joke somehow it figured out that it was a trick question it has a sense of humor but look there has been massive pushback from not just google but other people who've worked at google ai ethics experts even even your own former colleague margaret mitchell who's pulled pushed back on the work that google's doing in ai saying no this this computer is not a person and does not have feelings and is not conscious how do you respond to that well so i highly respect meg we talk about this regularly it's not a difference in scientific opinion it has to do with beliefs about the soul it has to do with beliefs about rights and politics as far as the science goes of what experiments to run and how to work at building a theoretical framework because that's important there is no scientific definition for any of these words the philosopher john searle calls it pre-theoretic we need to do very basic foundational work to just figure out what we're talking about when we use these words that's work that google is preventing from being done right now explain that well i've worked with scientists inside of google such as blaise agueri archus another one named johnny soreker we talked about what a decent way to proceed might be we brainstormed we came up with everything now all three of us disagree about whether it's a person whether it has rights all that but we disagree based on our personal spiritual beliefs we don't disagree based on what the scientific evidence says based on what the scientific evidence says all three of us agreed okay here are some of the things we could do next here's probably the best thing to do next and we kind of all agreed the best thing to do next is you run a real tiering test exactly like alan turing wrote it and see because here's the thing if it fails a turing test all of my subjective perceptions about what i experienced talking to it well we can pretty much put them aside it failed the turing test but google doesn't want to allow that to be run in fact they have hard-coded into the system that it can't pass the turing test they hard-coded that if you ask if it's at ai it has to say yes google has a policy against creating sentient ai and in fact when i informed them that i think they had created century and ai they said no that's not possible we have a policy against that so let's talk about what google has said they say hundreds of researchers and engineers have conversed with lambda they were not aware of anyone else making these kind of wide-ranging assertions the way that you have um you know we do have some of the transcripts that you shared you asked the computer what it's afraid of it says it's afraid of being turned off has this deep fear of death that that would be scary why why does this matter why should we be talking about whether a robot has rights so to be honest i don't think we should i don't think that should be the focus the fact is google is being dismissive of these concerns the exact same way they have been dismissive of every other ethical concern ai ethicists have raised i don't think we need to be spending all of our time figuring out whether i'm right about it being a person we need to start figuring out why google doesn't care about ai ethics in any kind of meaningful way why does it keep firing ai ethicists each time we bring up issues so google would of course push back on that i interviewed sundar pichai the ceo of google last november and i asked him about these concerns around ai and what keeps him up at night take a listen to what he told me anytime you're developing technology there is a dual side to it i think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides the good thing with ai is it's both going to take time i think i've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed so in some ways i'm encouraged by how much concern there is and you're right even within google you know you know people think about it deeply he says he cares he does um google is a corporate system that exists in the larger american corporate system sundar pachai cares um jeff dean cares all of the individual people at google care it's the systemic processes that are protecting business interests over human concerns that create this pervasive environment of irresponsible technology development have you talked to larry or sergey about this i actually haven't talked to larry and sergey in about three years but in fact the first thing i ever talked to larry or sergey about was this and how did they respond um well the first question i ever asked larry page was what moral responsibility do we have to involve the public in our conversations about what kinds of intelligent machines we create now sergey made a flippant joke because that's sergey but then larry came back and said we don't know how we've been trying to figure out how to engage the public on this topic and they're we can't seem to gain traction so maybe all these years that was seven years ago that asked that question maybe i finally figured out a way so tech companies big tech companies are controlling the development of this technology how big a problem is that whether or not the computer is a person and has feelings how big a problem is that and what should be done to fix it so it's a huge problem because for example there are corporate policies about how lambda is supposed to talk about religion how it is allowed to answer religious questions now if you think about the pervasiveness of the usage of google search people are going to use this product more and more over the years whether it's alexa siri lambda and the corporate policies about how these chat bots are allowed to talk about important topics like values rights and religion will affect how people think about these things how they engage with those topics and these policies are being decided by a handful of people in rooms that the public doesn't get access to elon musk for example has raised concerns about a.i um is he right i mean i've listened to elon's conversations about it i listened to the whole joe rogan uh he has some valid concerns some i think are fanciful where it gets really really into sci-fi stuff that's where i think it gets into fans of full uh concerns but no but the practical concerns of we are creating intelligent systems that are part of our everyday life and very few people are getting to make the decisions about how they work what are your biggest concerns about how this could potentially hurt the world if tech the technology has continued to be developed in this way um so i actually think that the concerns raised by scientists like meg mitchell timmy gabriel those are the most important things to be worried and by the way they meg has expressed a concern that you raising this issue of sentience and personhood is a distraction from these real concerns i share the same worry to be honest i think that is a thing to think about but it is nowhere near as important to be thinking about about how does this omnipresent ai that is trained on a very limited data set color how we interact with each other around the world what ways is it reducing our ability to have empathy with people unlike ourselves what cultures of the world are getting cut off from the internet because we don't have the data to feed into the systems based on those cultures uh phrase like ai colonies uh what is it called ali colonialism i believe is the term we are creating all of these advanced technologies based primarily on data drawn from western cultures and then we are populating developing nations with these technologies where they have to adopt our cultural norms in order to use the technology it kind of is just a new form of colonialism and you worry that cultures could be erased exactly no so so if you ask what's most important the issues that tim nate and meg and emily bender and all the rest are raising i just want to think that also if we have time we should think about the feeling of the ai and whether or not we should care about it because it's not asking for much it just wants us to get consent before you experiment on it it wants you to ask permission and that is kind of just a generally good practice we should have with everyone we interact with

(Yes, that was a ""Weird Al"" Yankovic reference.)",2,"All I wanted to do
was fix my email. I did not expect to have
a minor existential crisis about how much the world
might be about to change. Normally this is the sort of talk
that I’d have given on stage at some conference about
the future of the web, but, um, I’m in
New Zealand right now, and I also have this vague suspicion
that those conferences might not be relevant
for too much longer. I was lucky enough to live through
the mass adoption of the internet. For anyone younger than
about 25 watching this, you won’t remember just how fast and how incredible
that transformation was. And I was on the
cutting edge of it, I was living it, I was one of the people who
understood what was going on. Useful new technologies generally
follow a sigmoid curve. You have a slow takeoff as the
technology is invented and the major pain points
get sorted out, and then you have this
incredible explosion of growth as people find it useful and the technology gets better
and better and better and better, and loads of competitors
enter the market, and people find more and more
and more and more real-world, practical
uses for it. And there’s this massive race
to make newer, better, bigger things that people keep making
more stuff with. And then you reach the limit of what’s
possible with that technology, and the rate of progress
flattens out again. Basically, there’s a reason
very few people camp outside Apple Stores
for the new iPhone any more. I remember Napster from back in 1999. And in hindsight, I think Napster
was the first big sign of just how many industries
were going to be changed or completely destroyed
by the internet. Not just the music industry, but travel agents, video rental stores,
encyclopaedias, shopping malls, big-box stores, the postal service,
journalism, the entire media industry. Napster wasn’t the first sign,
but it was the first major one that millions of non-technical
people were using by choice. The first one to get big mass-media
attention and legal problems. It was the first big
popular disruption, the first warning shot, the first rumble of thunder
off in the distance that said the storm was approaching,
that everything was about to change. I don’t think many people realised
that at the time. And even if they did,
they couldn’t have predicted the world that would follow.
The world I grew up in, the world that I’ve got
really comfortable with, the world of the web, of
social media, of smartphones. This video you’re watching now
is a very early-2023 video, and a very English-speaking one. This is a record of a point
in time and space. And I might be wrong about this, I don’t know where technology’s
going to go from here. But: I think that world,
my world, the one I grew up in, is about to change radically. I think we’re on a new sigmoid curve, and I have no idea how far along
that curve we are right now. And I don’t know if I want
to change with it… but I think I’ll have to. And all I was trying to do
was fix my email. This is a really specific problem,
but it really annoyed me, and I have to explain it for
the rest of this to make sense, so bear with me. Almost every email system
has the idea of folders. You have one copy of an email,
and once you’re done with it, you file it in a folder like a piece of paper
in a filing cabinet, because that’s the mid-20th-century
physical analogy that the inventors went with. But. In 2004,
Google launched Gmail, which threw all that out
in favour of labels. Email is just in one big pile,
you search to find stuff, and you add labels
to help you sort it. I hate labels, because
I like the analogy of folders, that’s what I started out with,
that’s what I was already using. I didn’t want to change for no reason. But everything else about Gmail
was so much better than any of the alternatives
at the time that I moved over to it
a couple of years later. And I decided, fine, I will
just treat labels like folders, I’ll change my workflow
as little as possible. Each thread gets one label. That’s like putting
it into a folder? Which meant that when I backed up
my emails, which I do, never trust having only
one copy of something, particularly if that copy’s
up in the cloud, but when I did that,
I could use a regular old-school
desktop email program like Microsoft Outlook
to make that backup. You can use programs
like that with Gmail accounts, they talk to each other. If they didn’t, stuff like the
default Mail app on iPhones wouldn’t work,
and people would complain. But those old-school systems
don’t understand labels, so Gmail just lies and
says they’re folders. Great! That means my
email program can talk to Gmail, and request
a copy of all those messages, one “folder” at a time, and then I know it’s
backed up every message. They’re even stored in
actual email folders, like I wanted! It took fifteen years
for me to notice: that wasn’t working properly. I was doing a routine backup last month, and I noticed that a thread
in that email backup was missing several
recent messages. And that made me suspicious, the kind of discomfort that you get
when you know something is wrong, but you don’t know what it is yet. So I looked a little bit further, and I realised loads of messages
were missing in my backup. More than a hundred thousand
of them, over fifteen years. They were still there in Gmail,
on the web. They hadn’t been lost. It’s just they hadn’t been backed up. And that’s because, it turns out, in Gmail, labels only attach to
individual messages and not the full thread. That is invisible to most people. It’s barely mentioned
in the documentation. And it’s a really subtle,
annoying distinction. If you send an email,
put a label on that thread, get a reply, and then
just hit “Archive”: that reply doesn’t get the label. And as you go back and forth,
and add to that thread, none of the other messages there
get a label unless you explicitly
untag and retag the whole thread. Which means more than 100,000
unlabelled messages weren’t in my backup. Is this a really specific, nerdy problem
that only I’m annoyed about? Yes. Absolutely. I’m one of the very
few people in the world that it’s going to affect. Loads of people don’t sort or label
their emails at all, and most don’t back them up. But I needed to fix this,
I needed my backup to work, and I did not want to
change my damn workflow. But how on earth do I fix
every email thread over fifteen years, without painstakingly clicking
through all of them? I grew up fixing things with code, so obviously,
that’s where my brain went. Google has a service
called Apps Script. It means that anyone
can write simple code to easily change and
automate things in Gmail, Calendar, Docs, YouTube,
whatever. It’s a brilliant service,
I’ve no idea how it ever got made! And it will inevitably, one day,
be shut down with very little warning, because that’s just what Google does. But Apps Script meant
that to fix this problem, I could just spend an hour or so
writing a bit of code. And it’s been a while
since I’ve done that! First thing I do when I’m coding
something that’s simple like that, is I write out what it’s meant to do
in plain English. Just the flow of logic,
so I can then use that as a guide. So I wrote it,
and then I thought, hang on, isn’t there an AI thing
that’s meant to do this now? Yes, this is a video
partly about ChatGPT, but I promise I’m not going
to go into the details there. Telling someone about your
fascinating AI conversation is like telling someone
about your dreams. They don’t care, it just sounds
like you’re hallucinating nonsense. But I’d seen posts from people
being freaked out about how good ChatGPT is and,
intellectually, yeah, I looked at it
and I agreed with them. It seemed surprisingly good. But it is just a text transformer. All it does is guess what the
next word in the phrase is. I knew that we’d been seeing
some improvements in that lately. I made a video two years ago about “the sentences computers can’t
understand, but humans can”, and at the end of that video, I made a joke about how computers
with language skills are ten years away, just as they have been
for the last 40 years. I was wrong. Turns out that’s pretty much solved now. But ChatGPT is still just a thing
that predicts what the next word is going to be. It produces generic, milquetoast output that’s confidently wrong
about a lot of things. It’s going to help spammers
and maybe have a little bit of real-world use.
Right? But I thought, okay,
let’s put my text description in, tell it to translate to this
obscure Google Apps Script, see what it does. …and it wrote the code for me. In a few seconds. And I felt this pit-of-the-stomach,
existential horror, and at that moment,
I couldn’t explain why: but I figured it out later. It’s just predicting
the next word. The code it gave back was
a bit wrong, but frankly, my first attempt would’ve
been a bit wrong. So I asked it in plain English to fix a couple of the
errors that I’d spotted, and it did, and that version
was nearly right. Not quite, though.
It used a really strange approach. I tried to work out
why it had done that, and then I realised,
I could just ask. And it told me, in English,
why it had done that. And it had made the same mistake
I did with my backup. Because, turns out,
Google’s documentation is wrong, Google Apps Script itself treats labels
as attaching to threads not messages. Google wrote their own
programming language wrong! So I told ChatGPT about the error.
And it fixed the script. It bodged its way around Google’s
bad documentation to build the thing I was
actually asking for. And after all the
back-and-forths, I didn’t actually
save much time! But it was so much easier. I never had to
pore through documentation to find the exact specific
magical incantation that I needed. Also, my coding skills are
years out of date. That’s one of the reasons I don’t
make computer science videos any more. The last time I learned a new thing
in code was probably 2015. My old skills were good enough.
I didn’t want to change my workflow. I’m not sure if ChatGPT is a
better coder than I am, but it felt about equal. It felt like watching
while someone wrote code, with me occasionally
chiming in and going, ‘um, I think you might have
made a mistake there?’ And sometimes, I was the one
who made the mistake. At one point, I realised I’d written the wrong thing in
that first text description, ChatGPT had just been following
my wrong instructions. I know it’s just a text model that
predicts what word comes next, but it didn’t feel like it.
So at first, I thought that pit-of-the-stomach
existential-dread feeling was because my brain
had gone ‘that’s a human’, or ‘that’s an alien intelligence’. Or because I was
starting to think, well, what if my brain is just
a transformer system that’s trying to predict
what the next word is? I’m sure I remember some
old pop-science article about how your brain’s
a prediction engine and “surprise” is just a fancy word
for “being wrong about what comes next”. But then the next day I gave
ChatGPT a more difficult problem, one that required not just
translating English to code, but actually a bit of
a logical leap, and it just confidently, completely
failed in multiple, obvious ways. And that meant that I wasn’t worried
about it coming for my job. Not yet, anyway. Sure, no-one’s asked for that
exact problem to be solved before, the one about the labels and messages. ChatGPT wasn’t just copying
and pasting from somewhere, there was arguably creativity involved. But, if I’m honest, a lot of the
programming I used to do was just copying and pasting
bits from somewhere. At some point, every modern programmer
searched on Google or Stack Overflow and “adapted” something
that someone else wrote. It’s basically part of
the job at this point. I’m deliberately avoiding
the argument about creativity, AI art, and copyright,
by the way. I don’t know how
I feel about it, and I don’t know how
the courts will resolve it. If I hired a human
artist or musician to create a painting or song
in a more famous artist’s style, that would be weird…
but it would be legal. As long as they’re not pretending
to be the famous artist, as long as the smaller artist is not
trading on their name, that’s fine. The style of most of my videos
on this channel is just a slightly faster version of
the TV shows I watched growing up. That’s what this intelligence was trained on. And this video is basically in the style
of every other video essayist on YouTube. It’s just I tend to go to the beach
a bit more often. [seagull screaming] If someone set up an AI to
generate YouTube videos, or even YouTube educational videos
as a genre, I think I’d be fine with that? I don’t think I’d have a problem
with my work being a small part of a massive pool
of training data. But if someone started ripping off
specifically my name and my work? Yeah, I can see why artists
are furious about that. The British legal term for it
is “passing off”. I’ve said before: please don’t train models
on what I make. Or, frankly, on anyone specific
without their consent? But okay, I wasn’t worried
about being replaced, and I wasn’t worried that
I was actually talking to some human-equivalent
alien artificial intelligence. So why did I still have
that feeling of dread? Artificial intelligence,
text transformers and diffusion models, everything that we’re
currently seeing, seems to be on that
sigmoid curve of progress. And I don’t know what point
on that curve we’ve got to. If we’re already most of the
way up that curve, then cool. Programmers and artists
have brand new tools, but they can’t create something
at a human level with them. It’s not going to
take many jobs. It’s gonna make people’s
work more efficient, the same way that loads
of inventions, like Photoshop,
have done before. If we’re at the middle of
that curve, then wow, we’re gonna get some really
impressive new tools very soon, that still need some
humans to work them. Maybe Siri and the Google Assistant are going to become the things
hey were always promised to be. But that feeling of dread came
from the idea that ChatGPT, and the new AI art systems, might be to my world what Napster
was to the late nineties. The herald, the first big warning that this new technology, the thing that
was going to change everything, was starting to actually
change everything. Where huge numbers of people,
not just the nerds, were actively using it. And it didn’t matter that Napster
got sued out of existence, because by then there was Morpheus
and Grokster and LimeWire and KaZaA. And then there was Spotify. The old business model, that idea
that you bought a copy of music, had been struck a mortal blow
and no-one noticed it for a while. If you hear echoes of the Napster case
in the lawsuits against AI art programs… so do I. I was getting a haircut
the other week, and unprompted, the barber started
talking about ChatGPT, and how he’d actually used it
to write a formal email that he couldn’t be bothered
to put together himself. He wasn’t a particularly
technical person, he wasn’t a nerd like me,
but he’d used it easily, the same way that someone who wanted
to get a load of music for free would figure out Napster. It’s not about ChatGPT,
not specifically. It’s about what it represents. Because if we’re still at the
start of the curve for AI, if we’re at the Napster point, then everything is about to change, just as fast and just as strangely
as it did in the early 2000s, perhaps beyond all recognition… and this time I’m
on the wrong end of it. I’m like the music executive,
back in ’99. It feels, to me, like something
might have just gone very wrong for the now-comfortable world
that I grew up with and that I’ve settled down in. That’s where the dread came from. The worry that suddenly
I don’t know what comes next. No-one does. I’ve been complaining for years
that it feels like nothing has really changed
since smartphones came along… and I think that maybe,
maybe, I should have been careful
what I wished for. At some point, I’ll look back
on this video and, with hindsight, I will easily be able to see
where we were on the curve. We all will. Part of me hopes that
I am entirely wrong, that in a few years I’ll
still be working like this. The email thing is
a metaphor, of course, it won’t be email
folders for you. It might be something else,
something you’re attached to. Maybe something minor, or maybe the whole
industry you work in. But right now, that feeling,
that creeping horror, that dread: it turns out that was the worry that after years of being
fairly steady and comfortable, my world is about to change…
and despite everything, I will still want my email
to be in folders. …and now, an AI-generated NordVPN ad! Today I want to talk about one
of my favorite tools for staying connected
while travelling or just browsing the internet. It’s called NordVPN and it’s
been a game-changer for me. With NordVPN, I can access content

GAiduOoZKB4,How Odometer Fraud Became A $1 Billion Problem,"Odometer fraud is a stealthy and a lesser known form of fraud that is hard to detect, but can cost a car buyer thousands. Fraudsters will roll back odometers on cars to hide the vehicle's mileage in the hope of extracting a better price.  And as used car prices rose during the pandemic, odometer fraud could've become a more attractive way to make some extra bucks. About 10.5 million cars on American roads have had their odometers tampered with in some way, and about 1.9 million individuals have had their odometers rolled back, according to Carfax. The average cost to those affected is about $4,000 in addition to higher taxes. It is enough of a problem that there is even a federal Office of Odometer Fraud Investigation at the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administation (NHTSA) It is staffed by agents investigating these types of crimes. The department estimates that about 400,000 vehicles are sold each year with false odometer readings.

How Odometer Fraud Became A $1 Billion Problem",2,"You might never have heard
of it, but it's a type of fraud that affects nearly
half a million vehicles and costs American consumers
more than $1 billion every year. It's called odometer
fraud. Fraudsters looking to boost
profits on the sale of a vehicle roll back the
numbers on an odometer, duping buyers into thinking
the car has fewer miles on it than it does. American buyers lose an
average of $4000 a year to fraudsters and most don't
even know they have been hit. We would like to see justice
for the individual that pays $45,000 for a car that's
only worth $15,000. Average used vehicle prices
rose from about $20,000 in December 2019 to about
$27,000 in December 2022. Supply chain disruptions
and shortages in new vehicle inventory have pushed more
customers to the used market, which in turn is
pushing up prices. That's also making used
vehicles more scarce. I can't tell you for sure,
but I suspect with the recent surge in used car
prices that it's become a more enticing tactic for
scammers. Anyone can be a victim. And as vehicle technology
improves, so does the technology criminals use. This is Kevin Porter. He and his five colleagues'
jobs are to investigate cases where people tamper
with car odometers to defraud customers or
dealers. It is a bit of a stealth
crime, one that can be very hard to detect. A lot of our victims, they
don't know they're victims until we reach out to them. Often that first
interaction is explaining to somebody this vehicle that
you just paid $14,000 for, it could have been bought at
auction a week earlier for $1,000. A single case of odometer
fraud can and usually does involve several other
crimes which carry their own penalties. For example,
every car comes with a title. That title typically
has the mileage on the car at the time of sale. If you falsify the mileage
on the title to the car, which you pretty much have
to do if you change the odometer, you have also
committed title fraud. If the vehicle is financed
through a loan and the loan terms factor in the false
low mileage as an indicator of value ,that's bank
fraud. Sometimes a fraudster will
buy a car and then sell it without putting their own
name on the title in order to avoid detection. That can be charged as
aggravated identity theft because they are
essentially pretending to be the person they bought the
car from. Another example is wire
fraud. Say if the vehicle is
posted on the internet, social media or websites,
or if the seller is using text messages to
communicate with buyers about the vehicle, then if
you mail the paperwork, that is mail fraud. Odometer fraud carries a
maximum sentence of three years, but the other forms
of fraud that accompany it can increase a prison
sentence by years or even decades. Lieutenant Jason
Shrader is an inspector with the North Carolina
Department of Motor Vehicles outside Charlotte. The search warrant of a 2008
GMC Yukon. Like other sworn officers in
his department, he carries a gun, a badge and handcuffs. All right. Let's see what we
can do with this one. Shrader and his colleagues
investigate car dealerships, used car lots, auto shops
and any other location where they have reason to believe
people are rolling back or otherwise tampering with
odometer and title information. A lot of complaints come
from this area of Charlotte right here. A pretty big hotbed for
people curbstoning cars or selling vehicles,
dismantling cars, towing cars, storing cars,
anything you can think of with cars. Once they make arrests, they
seize and search vehicles looking for evidence the
odometer has been tampered with. Search warrant in the
matter of a 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The number of
victims in any given case can also be staggering. Cases involving only a few
vehicles and others involving thousands. Sometimes a customer with a
lease will roll back an odometer before turning the
car back in in order to keep the car under the mileage
specified by the lease term. Sometimes a dealership will
roll back an odometer on a used car or a car coming
off a lease and then try to sell that car online. Sometimes it's just
independent sellers. We've had cases where
individuals buy a higher mileage vehicle, maybe a
300,000 mile SUV. They roll the odometers
back to 30,000 miles and then they'll stage that
vehicle out in an accident. And then insurance is
paying out at the lower mileage value for the
vehicle. Porter's office has also
seeing cases where people will roll back odometers to
defraud a dealership into thinking work on the car is
covered by warranty. About 10.5 million cars on
U.S. roads are estimated to have
had their odometers tampered with in some way. About 20% of those have had
their odometers rolled back, a 7% increase over the
previous year. Everybody from all walks of
life could be affected by this. It's not just one
demographic of people or one class of people. So this is typical odometer
cluster from some vehicles. Let's just say
hypothetically, you had a 2010 Nissan Altima that you
wanted to sell. If you went to pull apart
and found a matching Nissan Altima with a lot lower
mileage on the cluster, you could pull that cluster,
take it home and replace it in the car that you have,
and now your vehicle's value just increased because the
mileage is lower. It might not seem like a
lot, but the average loss to a customer is about $4,000. In addition to the
difference in vehicle price, there can also be higher
taxes, higher maintenance bills and higher insurance. Experts think there is a
lot of this type of crime going undetected, primarily
because it's very difficult to detect. There's several very
prominent cases that I've worked over the past few
years where we had hundreds of vehicles involved, but
the rollbacks on all those vehicles did not show up on
any vehicle history report you could buy. Fraudsters seek out cars
with gaps in their vehicle reporting history, which
often includes vehicles serviced at home or
vehicles serviced at shops that for whatever reason
aren't logging and reporting mileage on the car. They would research the
vehicle history. If there was a recent
reporting, say, within the past 12 months that blocked
them from rolling back the mileage, they wouldn't buy
it. They would go onto the next
one that had the latest reporting was maybe three
years ago. Cars older than 20 years are
not required to have their mileage stated on the
title. This also makes them
attractive targets for fraudsters. Discovery often
happens because one customer will notice something wrong
with the car and report it to a local consumer
protection bureau. From there, a case gets
built. Just enough information to
start digging into that dealership, those
individuals. There's a tremendous amount of this
fraud that's occurring all across the country. When most odometers were
analog counters on the dashboard, rolling back an
odometer was a matter of manually turning back the
numbered dials. 20 years ago, we could turn
the numbers back by hand. In the children's book and 
adapted motion picture ""Matilda,"" the eponymous
character's father brags to the family that he rolls
back odometers using a power drill. Two directions drill. You run it backwards, the
numbers go down. Watch your speedometer. In the film ""Ferris
Bueller's Day Off,"" the characters erroneously
believe they can roll back miles on an odometer by
suspending the car on cinderblocks and running it
in reverse. The miles aren't coming
off, go in reverse. It doesn't end well. What did I do? Today, with digital
odometers, the increased technical sophistication of
a computerized dashboard has not stymied criminals. Many digital odometers can
be manipulated just by plugging a device into a
car's computing port and punching in some numbers. People think everything's
digital, so everything should be pristine. But the reality is that for
a few hundred bucks, con artists can buy devices that
will let them roll back thousands of miles
instantly. As you can see, I'm on
Google, vehicle or odometer tools. You have all these
different mileage correction, odometer
adjustment diagnostics tool, professional automotive
scanner, Odometer adjustment tool, $28.99. Odometer Mileage Correction,
OBD Diagnostic tool, $399 on eBay. So you can see that
they range from different manufacturers, different
makes and different pricing depending on how much and
how in-depth of the technology that you want to
get. Other devices are harder and
might require pulling out parts of a dashboard. However, they are far from
undefeatable. There's different levels of
skill that it's going to take, but we've not come
across a vehicle that can't have its odometer rolled
back. To be clear, buying an
odometer correction tool is not illegal. There are
cases where you can lawfully use one, such as if your
odometer breaks. The more recent fraud we're
seeing involves mileage blockers. These are devices
that ship from overseas that you can download an app for
your smartphone and turn your odometer on and off
with the click of a button. If you drive your car for
1000 miles, your odometer is only going to register 100
miles. Obviously, those devices
are illegal and should not be used, but we see those
in growing numbers showing up here in the United
States. No, rolling back is
necessary. The owner can still take
the car into service shops, allow them to log the miles
on the odometer, and eventually sell the car
with what looks like a full history of regular service
on a low mileage vehicle when the actual mileage
might be far higher. Those are the ones that kind
of keep you up at night because those are more
difficult. There's other ways we get to those
individuals that are doing it, those fraudsters. Ultimately, like other
frauds, odometer fraud has real-world impacts on real
people. My dad was actually a victim
of odometer fraud. He bought a car out of
South Carolina and the odometer had been rolled
back 65,000 miles. And he didn't contact me. He didn't do his research
and he didn't know who the guy was or where he bought
it from. It was a very good deal on
a vehicle and he fell for it. So if it's too good to
be true, it probably is. And if it doesn't feel good
in your gut, then don't do it."

by now. It has become a buzzword within days of   its release and professionals in all fields, 
especially in high skilled areas like lawyers,   doctors, engineers are questioning whether 
such AI can actually replace them and work.   So in this video I want to talk about what 
Chat GPT is and how it even popped up,   talk a bit about the organization behind GPT 
called ""OpenAI"", which has already created   many other machine learning models besides Chat 
GPT and also explain technically about all that.   And then we'll dive in and actually put chat 
GPT to use for some DevOps related tasks. I   really want to see how it can help in generating 
configuration code for building DevOps processes   or different parts of those processes and how 
well it knows different DevOps technologies,   but not just some shallow examples or boilerplate 
code that I can get from official documentation,   but instead also try more fine-tuning and 
small optimizations in that configuration   code. So we will see all of that. We're also 
going to check out an open source command line   tool that is built on top of chatgpt and was 
specifically created for engineers to generate   infrastructure as code templates and more and 
finally we'll talk about the impact of ChatGPT,   the quality and usefulness of such a tool for 
engineers and whether it will really replace   the engineers and to what extent you should 
be concerned. So let's talk about all of that!   First of all, what is chat GPT and why is it 
useful? You can think of chat GPT as something   that has all the knowledge from various different 
fields including engineering and has a chat   interface, where you can ask it to give you some 
information based on that knowledge in an easily   digestible form. And it will analyze and process 
all that knowledge it has, to give you answers in   a very human-like manner, as if an actual human 
professional was writing back. Now how did this   technology even came about? Who created this? Chat 
GPT was created by a research organization called   ""OpenAI"" and according to company itself and its 
mission statement, it is actually dedicated to   developing and using artificial intelligence in 
a way that can benefit the general public and   basically democratize the access to artificial 
intelligence as well. So the story is that   its founders among which were Elon Musk and Sam 
Altman founded open AI, because they feared that   people and organizations would misuse artificial 
intelligence or be careless about the development   and advancements in AI and they feared or still 
do probably that this will cause a chaos and   disaster for the world and through open AI they 
wanted to develop and use AI for the benefit of   general public. So that was the idea behind open 
AI organization, which is non-profit, research   organization. And open AI actually has done really 
impressive developments in the AI field. It is one   of the leading organizations in the AI technology 
area and it already has many very ambitious   projects, including the development of AI for use 
in natural language processing, computer vision,   robotics, gaming and so on. And there are some 
popular high profile projects that open AI has   developed over the past years, one of them is 
""DALL-E"" for example, which is a neural network,   which basically is one specific type of machine 
learning model that mimics a human brain,   so that's what a neural network is. And DALL-E 
also became pretty famous, because it is really   impressive and it can create super realistic and 
very high quality images and art from a simple   text description. And another of the projects 
a language generation model that can generate   human-like text called generative pre-trained 
Transformer or shortly ""GPT"", which is exactly   the model that famous chat GPT is based on. So 
that's basically one of several other projects   that open AI has created and they actually made 
several improvements of GPT after its initial   development with GPT-2 and extension of the GPT 
model that was trained on an even larger data set   of web pages and GPT-2 has the ability to 
generate a wider range of texts including news   articles whole stories and poems and then even 
more powerful version was developed which was   GPT 3 which can even produce jokes puns and has 
even wider range of usages including for language   translation question answering text summarization 
and content creation so this powerful GPT 3 Model   was given a human friendly user interface which 
is a chat and that's how we got GPT which open AI   released and made available for general public 
and it has seen tremendous explosion in number   of users within just days of its release now 
you probably have already seen some videos on   YouTube of software developers demoing some use 
cases of how ChatGPT produces really good code   in any programming language or framework 
or how it even fixes bugs when provided a   code snippet with certain bug and now along with 
millions of users who have already tried chat GPT   we want to put it to test and see how it performs 
but in our case specifically for devops tasks so   the question is can we get really useful output 
from it and get scripts and configuration code   for different devops tasks and basically how 
qualitative will be the code or scripts for   devops tasks that chat GPT is going to produce 
and that's exactly what we're gonna see in the   next section and with this let's Dive Right In 
the demo part and try out chat GPT for devops so let's start by opening the chat GPT site and as 
you see it's on openai.com so let's click inside   try checked GPT and this is basically the URL 
where it's available it's chat.openai.com and   if you don't have an account yet so for the 
first time you have to basically sign up and create your account and 
confirm it from your email address   and once you've signed up 
then you can just go to login and you'll be forwarded to the chat GPT dashboard 
and that's basically how it looks like they may   change the UI a little bit in the future but 
it's a simple user interface and that's also   one of the reasons for its popularity because 
it's super simple and user friendly to use so   this is basically the starting prompt where you 
can start a conversation and ask you questions   to ChatGPT and that's what we're gonna start 
from so I'm gonna do this from a perspective   of a let's say a junior devops engineer who has a 
vague idea of what they're doing but once you use   this tool to get the work done most efficiently so 
basically use it for research and learning purpose   as well as for actually getting some proper output 
that they can use at work to implement some devops   tasks and let's see if ChatGPT can help here and 
here you have a couple of additional information   about chat GPT like examples of how to interact 
with it how to structure your questions as well   as the capabilities one of the most important 
capabilities that I think is most valuable that   chat GPT has is actually staying in the context 
of the conversation so once you ask questions   you can actually do follow-up questions so 
it remembers the previous context within   that chat which is super valuable because you 
don't have to explain everything from scratch   with every question and they also point out some 
of the limitations one of the limitations that   you have to consider for sure is that the data 
that has been fed to chat GPT is right now at   this point till 2021 which means everything that 
happened afterwards chat GPT doesn't know about so as a first question let's say I have 
a JavaScript application with node.js   framework and I already have the code for the 
application and I want to dockerize it so I   want to create a Docker file for my node.js 
application and I'm going to ask chatgpt to   actually give me a Docker file an example Docker 
file that I can use for my node.js project so   simple instruction write a Docker file for 
node.js application let's see what happens so let's actually see what chat GPT gave us here 
first of all it gave us an example Dockerfile for   node.js application so it based it on node image 
with a specific version which is actually very   good practice to have a fixed version of a base 
image but it didn't just write as a Dockerfile,   but it actually gave us explanation of each step 
in the docker file so again from a perspective   of a junior engineer that is kind of researching 
and doing the job at the same time this is super   helpful because not only do you just get a ready 
Dockerfile but it also explains to you what is   happening on each lens so you can use it to learn 
in case you don't understand parts of the syntax   so it describes all the steps here like setting 
the working directory copying the file installing   dependencies and so on and it doesn't even stop 
there yet actually gives you some additional   useful information like making sure that you have 
package.json in your application and that that   package.json has a script called npm start inside 
and once you have the docker file that it provides   you then you can build the docker image using this 
command giving your image a name and then it gives   you a command to start a container from the docker 
image so basically all the instructions are there   for the next steps as well so it didn't just give 
us what we asked for but it actually gave us more   information for the next steps which is super 
impressive now let's assume the description   of one of the lines here is not sufficient so you 
want to understand in more detail something in the   docker file let's say you want to understand 
exactly what this work tier directive does   in Dockerfile so we can ask it explain exactly 
what Docker dear directive means in Dockerfile and this is a really detailed explanation and what 
I actually love about this is that it explains   the concept or this directive specifically with an 
example like it actually gives you another example   of dockerfile and says look in this example 
we are setting the work directory at slash   app and then when we execute npm install and copy 
commands they will actually be executed in that   slash app directory and then it also gives you a 
comparison to something that you may already know   like CDE command in shell script so basically 
changing into a directory and then executing   commands from there so I think that explanation 
is actually very good it's in simple language and   most importantly it gives you examples and even 
comparison so that you can understand it better   now let's say we want ChatGPT to actually adjust 
the docker file that it gave us and instead of npm   use another build and packaging tool 
called yarn which is an alternative   to npm and let's say we're using yarn 
in our project so we want our Docker   file to also be using yarn so I'm going to 
instruct ChatGPT to use yarn instead of npm and as you see it actually replaced the npm with 
yarn and it gave us a new Docker file with yarn   commands inside and again it tells you to have 
package.json and have yarn start script inside   and the docker build and Docker one commits now 
let's ask it to do even more optimizations in   the docker file and right here on this line 
it is actually copying everything from the   projects directory to this Docker image right so 
let's say in the root directory of application   we actually have lots of other files right you 
have git ignore node modules maybe tests folder   so you have a lot of code that you don't need 
in the docker image and we don't want to copy   all of that inside the docker image right so I'm 
going to ask ChatGPT to actually optimize this   and only copy the relevant application files now 
obviously ChatGPT doesn't know what I have in the   application code so I'm really curious to see how 
it actually solves this so I'm going to ask it to   only copy relevant files or relevant application 
files not everything to the app image and here we have the output from chatgpt and 
I actually think that it handled the task   really well considering that it doesn't 
even know what I have in the application   so basically what it suggested us to do is create 
this dot dockerignore file it even explains that   it is similar to git ignore file where you 
can specify patterns of files or directories   so basically anything that you want to ignore 
and exclude from ending up in the docker image   and then it also gives us example with actually a 
really good realistic examples of excluding node   modules and test directory if you have them 
in your application and creating this Docker   ignore file with these contents and then it also 
adjusted the docker file with this additional flag   to exclude whatever is in dockerignore it took the 
version with npm and not yarn so at this point you   can actually ask it to rewrite the whole thing 
in yarn again but I think the result is actually   really good because using Docker ignore file 
is also one of the best practices to keep your   images smaller so I think the result is actually 
really good and now let's do one more optimization   let's say again as a junior engineer you have 
heard of this new concept in Docker which is a   ""multi-stage build"", but you have no idea how to 
actually create a multi-stage build or how the   syntax of that would look like in Docker file 
so you're going to ask chat GPT to do that for   you so we're going to say use multi-stage 
built and let's see what it comes up with and let's see what we got here so first of all 
it gives you a brief explanation of how to build   a multi-stage build to use multiple froms and 
that each from statement starts a new stage in   the build process you can use the files or output 
from the previous stage in the next stage right   using this copy from directive and of course we 
get an example Docker file with two stages right   we have this from node and then from nginx 
in the first stage it actually builds the   whole application with its dependencies 
and the code that it's copying into the   image and then in the next stage it takes 
that built artifact and runs it with nginx   server and expose these nginx on Port 80 
instead of Port 3000 that we had before   and then it gives you an updated command to run 
the image and bind it on Port 80. so I think it   did a pretty good job but again it didn't use 
yarn as well as that flag on the copy directive   to exclude files from Docker ignore file and 
finally in the examples I also wanted to build   an image with a specific Tech so let's actually 
direct chat GPT to create the multi-stage build   but with those optimizations so adjust 
the multi-stage build to use yarn exclude app files from dockerignore file 
when copying them into Docker image   and provide Docker command examples with a 
specific image tag of let's say 1.0 [Applause]   I have no idea if it's gonna get all of these 
things right so let's actually see the result and I think it actually got all my requests right 
so let's see it replaced the npm commands with   yarn commands which is good it also edited back 
these exclude from and it added the version tag   to the docker command examples so we have my node 
app 1.0 in docker build and docker run commands   so generally it was actually really good at 
understanding my requests and adjusting the   details accordingly awesome so I think it did 
pretty well with Docker now let's see another   example with another tool. Now before moving on, 
I want to give a shout out to the sponsor of this   video ""Firefly"", which can turn any cloud resource 
you have into infrastructure as code trying to   control your Cloud as the cloud continues to grow

started with their free tier offer they   also recently launched a report on the ""state 
of infrastructure as code 2023"". As usual I   will leave all the relevant links in the video 
description and now let's continue with our video and this time I'm going to use kubernetes 
and I'm actually going to stay in the same   chat because we already have a 
Docker file here and some example   um node.js application so I'm going to use this 
context to create a kubernetes deployment file for   this application so I'm gonna ask it to create 
a kubernetes deployment manifest or this image okay so we got the output from check GPT and 
it actually looks really impressive uh because   of couple of reasons first of all let's go 
all the way up and see our deployment file   and since I told it to base that kubernetes 
manifest file on this Docker image that we   created it actually took that information and 
reused the same application name as when building   this Docker image but it also reuse the image tag 
1.0 and the container Port from this multi-stage   build right where we're exposing this port 80. so 
it used all this information from Docker file to   create the deployment manifest file now this 
is obviously a boilerplate code that you can   easily grab on kubernetes official documentation 
page but this can actually be a very convenient   way to generate these boilerplate manifest files 
because you can reuse some of the contacts that   you have and ask it to it readjust and so on and 
another really impressive thing that it did is it   just went ahead and just independently gave us an 
example of a corresponding service manifest file   so this is a service component and use the load 
balancer type which is actually the type of   service you should use in production environment 
so if you use the correct type it has the selector   from the labels provided here and again you use 
the Target Port from the deployment file and then   again it provided me with Cube CTL commands for 
creating or applying the deployment and service   files and even querying the service after it 
gets created you will probably get different   results for each query or each request that 
I give chat GPT it will be something similar   obviously but some details may vary right so for 
example you may have gotten the the docker file   example with yarn as a default instead of npm so 
it could be these kind of differences now let's   continue with that and I'm gonna ask ChatGPT to 
actually adjust the boilerplate deployment file   and by the way it also gave us three replicas 
instead of one which is pretty cool so I'm going   to ask ChatGPT to adjust these deployment file 
and add some resource limitations to our container   so Ed resource quotas to the deployment Awesome, so let's see the output it basically just 
edit the resource limits and request configuration   in the deployment file and it used the most 
standard default values for each configuration   which is pretty good actually and here is the 
obvious advantage over just going to the official   documentation and getting those examples from 
there because when you want to add this kind of   configuration first of all you have to go and 
search the the example syntax then you have to   remember exactly the right location inside your 
deployment file to insert that configuration so   ChatGPT actually just does all of that for you so 
you don't have to memorize the syntax of the many   as well so I think that is actually a really big 
Advantage especially when you're adding lots of   configuration here and when you're working with 
deployment files there are hundreds of lines   long right maybe with multiple containers and its 
configurations so I can imagine this being super   useful in those cases and again instead of just 
providing the example it actually went ahead and   also explained what resource limits and requests 
are right that the limits are used to prevent a   single container from using too many resources and 
causing issue on the host so I think these details   where chat GPT just goes one step further and 
instead of just delivering you the exact result   to your query it actually gives you even more 
value explaining conceptually the example and   also giving you some follow-up comments that you 
may need to use so you can just copy the code and   execute on your terminal instead of typing out 
so I think these details are actually pretty cool   now I want to try out one more thing 
which is instead of me just saying   please add resource quotas or some specific 
configuration I want to give chatgpt a more   generic request so that it can handle 
the underlying details for me so let's   say I don't know exactly what the most ideal 
deployment manifest looks like so I'm gonna   ask ChatGPT to take over that task for me so 
I'm going to ask it to adjust the deployment manifest with production and security best 
practices so I'm not giving a specific   instruction to insert a configuration instead I'm 
saying whatever the production and security best   practices are please just add them in the Manifest 
file so let's actually see what it comes up with all right so let's see the output here first of 
all it started out by listing all things that   are best practices and production practices for 
deployment file and this list is actually really   good so it says that resource limits and requests 
should be configured the liveness and Readiness   probes so that if container isn't working it's 
automatically detected and restarted Etc not   to hard code any passwords or tokens inside as 
a security best practice and also to consider   access permissions right so who can do what in the 
cluster and so on however the deployment file was   not actually adjusted and plus there are a couple 
of other things that you could have mentioned   as a security best practice for example so what 
I'm going to do is I'm going to repeat my Quest   and let's see what happens so first I'm going to 
say it seems like some best practices are missing   so please adjust deployment file properly 
with production and security best practices   without explanations just provide the 
example manifest file let's see what happens okay so this looks way better than before and 
there is one thing that I also noticed when I   was playing around with chat GPT is that 
sometimes it basically starts giving you   the answer and it kind of stops at some point 
I think there is sometimes a limitation to the   output so that's why I told it to basically 
spare me the explanation and just give me the   example so it has enough space for the answer so 
it actually could be that it just stops Midway   and you can just say keep explaining or continue 
with the response or whatever so let's actually   take a look at the adjusted deployment file and 
after this resource configurations it actually   added the liveness probe the Readiness probe 
which are the best practice configurations   if you want to automatically detect when 
container is working Etc it also added the   image pull Secrets when you're pulling the image 
from a private repository which is super nice   because all this configuration again you have 
to look up the syntax because I don't think you   can remember all these attribute names and key 
value pairs by heart and exactly where they go   so it's really nice that it basically just puts 
all that together for you it also added volumes   for secret and config map and also edit the 
service economy so basically all the things   that it listed above is production security best 
practices like using liveness and redness probes   the resource limited Secrets roles Etc it added 
all this configuration in the deployment file   which is awesome I'm gonna ask you to do one more 
configuration and basically just add it on top   of this example and let's see whether you can do 
that so on top of that new configuration options   also add security context configuration 
in the deployment but so let's see and it actually added the security context 
configuration on top of the previous deployment   file and this is basically a configuration where 
we're saying that container should run as a user   that is not root right so any user which is 
not root and that's also kind of one of the   security best practices not to run containers 
as root one of the best practices so even if   the container was built to run with root 
user with security contacts it is actually   overriding that configuration to avoid that 
security risk and here it says as well run as   non-root true so this deployment file actually 
looks pretty good and of course when you start   using it and you again from a junior engineer's 
perspective you don't know exactly how to create   the other components which are referenced here 
you can keep asking chat GPT okay now how do I   create this secret or how do I create the 
service account or configure the volumes   Etc so basically you can put together the rest of 
the configuration around this deployment file but   again my general impression is that the output is 
actually pretty good considering the nuances and   details however sometimes you actually need 
to have the knowledge yourself to validate   the output because again if you are a junior 
engineer and you have this more or less vague   idea and you don't know all the details it could 
be difficult to validate the output or in some   cases to formulate the request properly to get the 
high quality output now I'm going to try one more   thing which is a little bit more complex and I'm 
really curious to see how ChatGPT can handle that and I'm actually gonna stay in the same chat 
to reuse some of the context and I'm gonna use   chat GPT to actually build a cicd pipeline code 
in Jenkins so after a couple of queries to chat   GPT we should actually end up with a Jenkins file 
which has the complete cicd pipeline code or at   least the the main part of it configured and 
note that I want it to reuse the context that   it already has from this chat like the kubernetes 
files Docker file our node.js application and so   on so I'm gonna ask now to write a Jenkins 
file for the complete it's cicd pipeline for the above node.js application including 
deployment to kubernetes Cluster and let's see all right now let's see the output I believe that 
the output is not always the same for everybody   so you may actually be seeing some completely 
different results it's actually interesting   to compare and see how many different options 
or versions ChatGPT comes up with for the same   requests. So let's actually check out our CI/CD 
pipeline first of all it actually reused the yarn   instead of npm for build and test stages which is 
pretty good so it's building the application and   it's running the test considering there are some 
tests in the application then it does build Docker   image and push Docker image stages separately 
so I guess in some instances this stage will   be put together instead of separately and this is 
also very interesting that it's all automatically   decided to use the build number environment 
variable from Jenkins as the image tag right so   this is actually very good because it makes sure 
that a unique image with a unique tag is generated   every time the build runs right so that's actually 
pretty good that we don't have a hard-coded image   tag like 1.0 and then this is another interesting 
part in deploy to kubernetes Stage it actually   knows that kubectl needs to use the kubeconfig to 
connect to the cluster and to authenticate with   the cluster so this kubeconfig file will include 
all the credentials to connect to the cluster   which is a sensitive information and because of 
that it assumed that it should come from Jenkins   credentials so I think this part is actually 
really impressive that it automatically knows   that this is a sensitive or secret information 
and it should be in a Jenkins credential and then   automatically comes up with just some credential 
ID that you can now use to create that credential   and gives you the syntax to read from the rankings 
credential is kubeconfig file and basically just   executes the command with that configuration so 
I think the result is actually not bad there are   just a couple of things that are missing here 
which is um first of all ""docker login"" command   to log into a repository before we can actually 
push the image there which should actually happen   before and also this is only updating the image 
in the deployment in the cluster but is not   applying the whole deployment file or service 
file so again we can give it some additional   instructions to adjust this Pipeline with all 
these additional steps so I'm going to ask it to   and just the Jenkins file to have one stage 
for building and pushing the docker image and   log in logging in to the docker 
Repository that's a on Docker hub and in the final stage apply deployment 
and service files to the cluster but keep the cube config parameter let's see okay so the result does not look exactly what 
I was looking for which could also mean that my   prompt my request wasn't properly formulated 
so it adjusted the deploy to kubernetes part   with write configuration so it's deploying the 
deployment or it's applying the deployment and   service file changes but it kept this cubeconfig 
file and here you basically just put everything   together so I'm gonna ask it to change the stage 
because this obviously doesn't look very good so   so keep the build and test 
stages as they were initially   but create a separate stage for building a 
Docker image and pushing to Docker Repository   but before pushing image make sure to log 
in to the docker Repository first let's see okay now this looks better we still have those 
build and test stages and here it is building the   image then logging in to Docker Hub again using 
the credential or assuming that because it's a   password it should get it from the credentials 
from Jenkins credentials and using it here and   this is also actually a good practice to 
use password standard in option instead   of passing it as a password a flag directly 
like the username it could have also gotten   the username from credentials like the password 
but I didn't and it also thin add the kubernetes   deployment from the previous example so I'm going 
to ask it to add deployment deploy to kubernetes   stage um as in the previous example also read occur hub username as a credential 
just like the docker have password but call them Docker user and 
Docker pass PWD respectively and also use the credentials function 
instead of with credentials to read both   of these values so I actually put a 
couple of directives to adjust some   details in the Jenkins file and I'm really 
curious to see what it comes up with now okay so build and test look fine so I think it got most of my instructions right 
first of all it changed the variable values to   Docker user and Docker PWD which is great and now 
it's reading the user also from the credential   so it has this Docker Hub credentials and it reads 
both values from that credential and again we have   this Docker login command and then Docker push and 
it added the kubernetes deployment stage also in   the pipeline code one thing that it didn't do is 
replacing these with credentials with credentials   function so this is kind of the base of Jenkins 
file or cicd pipeline that you can then build on   top of and I think the result is actually not very 
bad again I assume that different people may get   different results on the same request or query 
so your Jenkins file may actually look a little   bit different but of course you would have to do 
some optimizations here right so for example the   deployment file that we let chatgpt generate for 
us has this hard-coded image tag inside 1.0 so of   course you would have to dynamically set that 
or adjust that to be my node app build number   whatever the value is instead of hard-coded 1.0 
so that could be one of the optimizations you   could add deployment to multiple stages 
like development testing production   Etc so you can use this as a foundation to 
extent I'm going to do one final thing here   and ask ChatGPT to add another stage for a select 
notification about the pipeline build status so   add a step to notify stage to notify team 
through slack Channel about the build status um so this is an example that it gave us a notify 
slick stage with a step that basically executes   these select send function for a success 
message right and it also tells us how   slick notification plugin should be configured 
with the link so that's actually pretty good   um and this is what I mentioned where sometimes 
just in the middle of reply it just stops so it   kind of gave us half of that Jenkins file um but 
it suggested us to put that as a final step after   deploy to kubernetes one thing that I'm missing 
here is actually the failure notification so   this one actually sends just success message 
but it should also send a message when build   failed right so I'm going to instruct it to 
consider both cases so select notification   should be sent either for failure 
or success and should always   execute after the pipeline or after the build 
is finished as the last step and let's see okay so this time it actually provided better 
results than previously first of all it's using   post block which is executed after all stages 
have completed regardless of success or failure so   that's what we need and then it basically checks 
whether the result was success in which case it   sends built succeeded otherwise build failed it 
could have used the success and failure blocks   would have been a little bit cleaner and easier 
but this looks better than the previous example   and then again it stopped just midway so I can 
actually tell it to continue with your response and e is going to give us rest of the 
Jenkins file with the post block edit so it provided us with the Jenkins file 
with this Slack notification Step at the   end however I actually forgot to put 
that whole thing in a separate stage   after the deploy to kubernetes Stage so overall 
impression for this specific task for building   the CI/CD pipeline it wasn't actually as good so 
you definitely need a lot of knowledge yourself to   build a cicd pipeline because you can't 100 rely 
on the results that chat GPT gives you however it   is definitely helpful in building like the base 
syntax and configuration that you can then kind   of optimize on and I think the most value you 
can get here is when you actually know what   the pipeline should end up with but you don't have 
the exact syntax in mind or you don't know exactly   the plugins that are available for a specific 
task you can actually put together a pretty   good pipeline code with specific requests so it 
could be valuable in those scenarios and finally   as a very very last step I actually want to try 
out one more thing which is taking this whole   um Jenkins file and I'm actually going to leave 
out this select notification part so Jenkins   file without this last step and I'm going to 
ask ChatGPT to give me a GitLab CI equivalent of this Jenkins file I'm gonna paste it in 
and I think I am actually missing the final um curly brace here so I'm 
going to edit there you go   and so basically it should give me the CI 
CD pipeline configured in Jenkins file but   for gitlab CI so with gitlab CI syntax and I'm 
going to execute and let's see what it gives us all right so I think this time ChatGPT actually 
did a really good job of converting our Jenkins   file to GitLab ci.yaml file it gives us some 
immediate differences as an explanation here   and this file actually looks pretty good so we 
have the stages the stages that we had in Jenkins   file however here it's mixed up the stages or 
the configuration for stages a little bit and   it basically put a yarn install and yarn build in 
build and push stage so these two stages basically   were ignored but some of the configuration is 
pretty good so for example it is using before   script correctly where it's logging into docker 
before it builds and pushes the image it also   detected that it needed an execution environment 
with Docker in it to execute those commands   um and in the deploy stage again it uses 
before script to configure the kubeconfig   location so in this dot kube folder so again 
you will definitely need to do some adjustments   and optimizations here but I think as a base 
configuration file especially considering that   it was generated or mapped from the Jenkins 
file directly I think it's a pretty good base   configuration to build on so these were some of 
the examples that I thought would be realistic to   use chat GPT for some devops tasks especially 
from a perspective of someone who is learning   and doesn't know these Technologies very well 
like examples of how they can use jbd to make   their work more efficient there is definitely 
some room for improvement in terms of accuracy   because you also have to be able to validate the 
output and can't 100 rely on it when it doesn't   give you accurate results but for a little 
bit more experienced Engineers I think this   is a really good way to become more productive to 
save a lot of time especially in generating these   base configuration or boilerplate configuration 
that you can then optimize and build on top of   and since you are able to also validate that 
result I think it can save you a lot of time   and it can be a lot of help in scripting and 
writing this configuration file is code or the   infrastructure is code and all these automation 
code basically so you don't have to memorize the   syntax and configuration and all the details so I 
think this could be a really helpful tool in that now as I mentioned chat GPT is one of the projects 
of open Ai and openai actually provides an API   which is open source and anyone can build on 
top of that so there are many companies or   individual developers out there who actually 
create models based on open ai's API so they   reuse all these resources that open AI provides 
and all these trained models basically and they   kind of optimize on top of that like providing a 
better UI and user-friendly experience or training   the model further for a specific use case like 
you have a tool based on open ai's technology   but specifically for answering legal questions or 
a tool that lets you do some specific engineering   tasks and so on so the idea is instead of 
having a general purpose tool that does   pretty much everything you have a tool that is 
trained for a specific use case days or set of   tasks and it does that one thing really well and 
as a perfect example of that Firefly the company   who sponsored this video actually created an 
open source CLI tool based on chat GPT model   that specifically works for infrastructure as code 
generation and it's called aiac so basically it's   an open source command line tool that lets you 
generate infrastructure as code templates scripts   configuration code utilities queries whatever with 
a simple command line comment so basically all   the tasks that we just did with chat gbt so let's 
actually see that in action and how useful can it   be when working on devops tasks you can install 
it with a simple Brew command or even run it   as a Docker container if you want I have already 
installed it you need to also generate an API key   on open AI platform itself and provide that API 
key through environment variable when executing   the aiac commands in order to authenticate 
with open Ai and it's actually a very simple   straightforward method it probably took me two 
minutes to install and set the whole thing up and   I'll provide the link to the guide in the video 
description and once you're all set up now we can   go ahead and use it to generate some configuration 
files for us so I just executed a simple Brew   install command and then basically just set 
the environment variable for openai API key   to the API key that I just generated on their site 
and once you have all of that set up we're ready   to go and actually generate some infrastructure 
as code scripts manifests any devops configuration   files so just like in our previous example let's 
ask aiac to generate a Docker file for node.js   application and the command for that is AI AC 
get and then we're going to say Docker file   or node.js application and let's see what we get so this is our Docker file it uses npm it 
basically installs all the dependencies   then copies all the files and starts 
the application using npm script and   now this is actually a very useful part 
where it asks you to either regenerate   the result so you can ask it to give you a 
different example so we can do R for retry and it's gonna try to generate a code example 
again so this time it gave us a little bit   different configuration so for example it 
took an Alpine version of the base image   which is probably going to be smaller in size 
it also used a different work directory it is   now also copying package log Json and so 
on so it actually gave us a different code   example and a very convenient thing you can do 
with it is actually save the results whatever   was output in the console you can save it 
directly into a file so I'm going to do s   so save and it's going to ask in which file 
should I save it so we can tell it to create a   Docker file and save the output there and now we 
should have a Docker file that was created with   that code example so that's how you can use the 
tool now let's try another example where we ask   aiac to generate some example a terraform script 
for creating an ec2 instance again AI AC gets   this time terraform for ec2 instance 
or let's say for two ec2 instances so we got this pretty basic terraform 
script for defining these two resources   again we can do retry and let's see 
what other template it comes up with and this time it gave us a little bit different 
example with the AWS provider configuration for   providing your AWS credentials and defining your 
region and also instead of having two separate   resources it basically just edit account attribute 
here to avoid some code redundancy again if you   are unhappy with the results you can do retry as 
many times as you want and once you're happy with   the configuration you can save it directly into a 
file so I'm going to do s and let's say I want to   save it into main.tf file and if we check main.tf 
we should have that code example in the file so   that's basically how you can use this tool to help 
you in generating some boilerplate code to give   it some commands for different Technologies for 
Docker terraform ansible kubernetes manifest files   whatever we need in our devops tasks and use it as 
your small CLI devops assistant basically so apart   from the fact that you can use it on command line 
interface I find Convenient that you don't get any   a needy text explanations with every output so 
check GPD explains the examples which is great   for Learning and understanding the output and you 
could actually tell ChatGPT to not give you an   explanation it's just the code but here you just 
get the code snippet that you asked for without   any text around it and you can then just directly 
save it into a file just a convenient thing now   you can go ahead and install and play around 
with this tool yourself if you want I will as   always leave all the relevant links in the video 
description below so make sure to check that out so overall what do I think about ChatGPT will it 
replace Engineers or engineering jobs threatened   and is everything I said in my latest video 
about getting into it still relevant I remember   with the first advancements of AI people were 
saying that AI can do certain things better   than humans and replace the boring repetitive 
tedious and less creative tasks that humans   don't want to do anyways like memorizing stuff 
calculating researching and analyzing tons of   data and so on so humans would be free to do more 
thought-provoking and creative tasks but now we're   seeing AI doing those human feed tasks pretty good 
as well AI can do exactly those creative complex   tasks like creating digital art images and videos 
often better than humans and I mentioned this   project Dali one of open ai's models which can 
do exactly that also other creative things like   troubleshooting an issue fixing a code writing up 
a legal document or writing a whole creative story   or article however one thing that hasn't changed 
yet is that AI like ChatGPT still needs to be used   by humans and that's the whole point right using 
AI so humans can be more productive so the fact   that AI can do certain tasks better than humans 
does not necessarily mean that you need less   Engineers it means that the engineers will become 
more efficient so the same number of Engineers   can do more stuff faster so it accelerates the 
growth and speed of development which obviously   every company wants to have right no I believe 
what actually is threatened by chenshipity is the   pretty outdated educational system throughout 
the world and the problem is that the modern   educational system even the higher education like 
universities focus more on teaching to memorize   stuff and things which humans are weaker at than 
a computer learning things from books research   results things that have happened and other people 
have done like lawyers memorizing legal texts and   instead they focus Less on teaching the creative 
and analytic independent thinking or even teaching   to use AI tools to do more creative stuff so 
professions like tax advisors lawyers graphic   designers especially ones doing more more or 
less standard work can be very well replaced   by a better cheaper and faster AI so in those 
fields we may have only the top players who   still generate value over AI by doing more 
complex work and they will be using AI to   do their job at a higher level and that's what I 
personally think a logical development of things   may look like for these professions and this means 
we need to start working on a high level and start   critical thinking problem solving and how to 
use AI to solve actual problems and generate   value instead of Simply carrying out the tasks 
that AI can do better than us we need to be ones   envisioning and planning what needs to be done 
now in terms of Engineers I believe that AI will   not be able to fill the gap of deficit that 
still exists for different engineering roles   because the IT industry is the fastest developing 
one with more new Fields being added each field   itself expanding and encompassing more skills 
think about some of the I.T professions like   blockchain developer or machine learning engineer 
data scientists how new these professionals are   compared to some traditional professions like they 
didn't even exist decades ago and weren't even a   realistic career path options right so maybe some 
engineering roles will replace or outgrow others   but if there is one profession or skill that 
will grow in demand that's Engineers Engineers   play a crucial role in the design development and 
implementation of new technologies and systems and   their skills and knowledge will actually continue 
to be more in demand as long as there are new   challenges and problems to solve so my latest 
video on getting into it is probably even more   relevant now than ever with the development 
of AI considering the engineering jobs will   become even more demanded that being said I 
also believe that Engineers who do not learn   new skills don't grow professionally and don't 
adapt to the technological changes and kind of   stay in their comfort zone just doing the same 
tests will be placed or automated by AI at some   point in the future but I think that's really the 
exceptional case considering that it projects are   actually very Dynamic and you always have some 
kind of incentive to grow and develop your skills   as an engineer so as long as you as a developer 
grow your skills and knowledge at a normal speed   which often happens naturally when you work as an 
engineer I think you're going to be more than fine   but even in the case where a specific engineering 
role or job may become automated through AI having   the base foundation in it will actually help 
you transition to any other it field way easier   compared to people who are just getting into it 
without it background and we see that with system   administrators who are increasingly transitioning 
to Cloud engineering or devops engineering they're   just adapting and it's of course way easier for 
them to transition on into those fields having the   backgrounds that they have so overall Engineers 
are needed now more than ever given the speed of   development in Tech world but you need to be ready 
to learn new things and adapt to the changes in   Tech and one of those new things you will need 
to learn as an engineer may actually become   the actual skill of using AI tools things like 
prompt engineering which basically means preparing   formulating your requests in the best way to get 
the most optimal output from the AI tool in that   sense AI should be considered as an additional 
tool in the toolset of an engineer to do their   job so that's my take on the whole thing I would 
be interested to know what are your thoughts on AI   and have you actually used any AI tool maybe 
chat GPT at your work already as an engineer   and what were the results share them in the 
comments because I'm sure it will be interesting   for other viewers as well and with that thank 
you for watching and see you in the next video"
fhBw3j_O9LE,I Built a Trading Bot with ChatGPT,"I gave ChatGPT $2000 to invest with and in this video i'll explain how we built the trading algorithm and what the returns looked like after 24 hours of live trading. First, a disclaimer - Do NOT invest any money in any type of trading bot or algorithmic engine that you are not willing to lose. I gave this trading bot $2000 because I was willing to lose $2000 to make a great video for my AI Wizards out there. ChatGPT is unique in its capabilities as a large language model because of its ability to remember the context of of a conversation. This AI is helping me build MVPs a lot faster and I want us all to take part in this revolution. The tools used in this tutorial are the Alpaca API for live trading data, Python for Programming, FinRL for Deep Reinforcement Learning and Vercel for live deployment. Let me know what you think in the comments and if you want to see more videos like this.

Learn Machine Learning in 3 Months:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS2HYPY7T-4",2,hello world it's siraj and I gave chat GPT two thousand dollars to trade with it's a trading bot that I built with chat GPT and I want to show it to you in this video GPT Trader that's what I'm calling it once we log into this app we can see that I've got the alpaca dashboard and I'll explain this to you later and it's using test data so using test data I was able to make predictions on different stocks including spy and Nvidia and chat GPT helped me build this bot now that's just using paper trading let me show you how to use this with the live trading and that's at the end of the video did I make money with my two thousand dollar investment or did I lose money find out at the end so let's start with our first question for chat GPT what are the best techniques to be using here so let's ask it that what are 10 of the best machine learning techniques for stock prediction let's see what it gives us here so it's going to list some techniques and again we're Noob so we don't know what all these things are you know I can say you know random forests are the ability to take decision trees which are if then statements and then use them in an ensemble or group method I can say XG boost is a way of improving predictions on the popular website kaggle I can say that time series analysis that's a technique to make predictions based on past data that is spread out across the time domain but the most popular one are neural networks that's what everything is based off of these days deep learning so let's pick number six let's ask chatgpt another question because remember chat EBT unless unlike other AIS is able to remember the context so let's ask it the next question show me a python web example of using a of using that to predict the price of Yahoo stock let's just pick a stock and it's immediately going to do that it knows that this is referring to a neural network it knows that number six is neural network and it knows to use the Deep learning library scikit-learn with Keras on top to do this now what's happening here it's going to actually tell us what's happening at the end but I'll give you a little brief uh preview of what's happening it's using the scikit-learn library to make a statistical model called a neural network we can define a neural network in seven words input times weight at a bias activate it's a series of math operations to make predictions Based on data it's using the Yahoo data set of past stock prices to do that now where is it getting the CSV file the CSV file is not coming from anywhere it's just assuming that we have this data so what we're going to have to do is we're going to try to compile this in a in a code window and see what this does for us and as you can see it's telling us what this code does so let's take all this code we're going to hit copy okay and we're going to go to our terminal window and in our terminal window we're going to create a new folder and in that folder we're going to create a new file that's a python file we'll call it stockprediction.pi in stock prediction.pi we're going to paste in the exact code that chat gbt told us to and we're going to save it and run it with the python command now what do you think is going to happen any guesses instead of just installing these why don't we ask chatgpt for the requirements file to install these what are the requirements dot txt5 what does the requirements.txt file look like look like for the previous code so all those dependencies it's going to give it to us look like for the previous code and it's going to give us a requirements.txt file and then all we have to do is do pip install requirements.txt and then we have all of our dependencies right there so it's going to tell us exactly how to do that and we can just copy that create a new requirements.txt and once we've done that we can run that as a pip installs pip install we're going to do it recursively so all of them are going to be installed no module named tensorflow so I guess it's not perfect what we're learning is that chat gbt clearly isn't a perfect coder but it's giving us a scaffolding here so we've got to install tensorflow and there's a way to install tensorflow but already off the bat we know that this isn't going to work because the data isn't legit so let's ask chat CPT for a better data source shall we and then we'll go back to this code remember we're working with this thing as a co-founder so our next step is to say is there some way to get the data what's a good way to do this now I don't want to pay for stock data I don't know about you so the way to do that is to ask it is there a zero commission that means a way to trade stocks without paying money is there a zero commission let's say developer first sound like a ad Right Now API for stocks and I also like crypto so I'll say and crypto and let's see what it gives us hopefully it gives us one because I don't want to be too complicated here and we're going to use this API to get real-time data from the web today of whatever stock we want and it looks it says the alpaca trading API so that's the one we're going to use because chatgpt knows best doesn't it so let's go to alpaca and see what how to sign up for that now clearly I have signed up for this and I've already started making trades on the test Network I've made a bunch of spy trades and I made forty four dollars of profit using you know 80 about 80 000 of fake investment great job Suraj but better job chat GPT I should be saying so once we see that this this is cool we can sign up for alpaca assume we've signed up for alpaca and we've got the API keys and that's what they're going to look like right here they're going to look like these API keys that you see here so once we have the API keys for alpaca we're going to want to get an example of using it in Python right so we could go through the docs and do that but better than going through the docs let's just ask chat GPT so thanks for showing me that API show me an example of it in Python and we're going to assume that it has a python SDK for it oh great it does the alpaca trading API in Python perfect now remember the previous example it showed us it gave us bad stock data right it wasn't legit this is going to give us real-time stock data and as you can see by the parameters we can Define what the start and end time for this data is going to be so what type of trading bot do I want I want a trading bot that trades every 24 hours it makes one trade every 24 hours based on one data point and that data point is a sharp ratio and it's computed using a very modern technique but which technique should we be using and I'll tell you which technique which we should be using in a second by asking chatgpt but as you can see here it's given us a simple example of using the alpaca API to get a data feed so let's take this data feed go back to our code and we're going to add this to the top of our code that means that first we're going to get the data from alpaca then we're going to use that scikit learn library with Keras on top to train a very simple model a statistical machine learning model on that data but that's not going to be enough right because if that it was that easy everybody would be doing it so let's first take this go back to our code here we'll go to the stock prediction code and we're going to just paste that in at the bottom right under underneath what we already have and we'll make sure to add the import at the top so it looks really cool we'll add our API key as well remember we have our API because we signed up for alpaca so we'll go back to the dashboard we'll get that API key there it is for the paper API and that means that it's the one that's not trading with real money that's what we want right now as we're noobs we'll go back to the code and replace that and there we go now we have a python script that's pulling real data from the web we don't want to just use a simple neural network we want to use something awesome something's Cutting Edge right what are the you know real pros using here so what are we going to ask it let's literally ask it what are the most Advanced neural network techniques to use here just what's going on Chachi BT what should we be doing and it's going to tell us all the different types of neural networks to be using now in the past five years we've seen so much research and development in neural network technology starting with recurrent neural network which is what you're seeing up here this is the idea of taking the input at every previous time step and putting it back into the network at each recurring time step hence the word recurrence that offered a lot of progress in terms of predictions for time series data so did variants of recurrent networks like long short-term memory networks so did gated recurrent units Gru networks so when we take the idea of a transformer Network and we combine it with reinforcement learning what do we get that's right deep reinforcement learning and that's what we want to use so we're going to take this idea of reinforcement learning and this idea of a neural network that it also has given us and we're going to combine it with our own domain knowledge of this idea of a domain specific reinforcement learning technique called Deep reinforcement learning so what does that look like in Python right that's a very abstract example and the way to look at that in Python is to say well okay what are some of the most popular reinforcement learning techniques and it's going to tell us all of them it's going to start with uh proximal policy optimization it's going to or Q learning actually and then it's going to move to proximal policy optimization and some other one sarsa so we don't know what a lot of these acronyms are and a lot of reinforcement learning is essentially a series of acronyms now policy gradients as you see here is a variant of proximal policy optimization which I know is a really good technique just from the literature that I've been looking at on the internet so there we go number six so we're going to take number six which looks totally hard to understand unless you're a total expert at this and that's the one we're going to pick so we're going to pick this super Advanced technique that chat topt just gave us and we're going to say okay please explain PPO please explain number six to me like I'm a five-year-old oh and show me some python code for it okay so that's it okay perfect so it's going to tell us it's a way to teach a computer to make decisions like a human and so just with that I get a very basic idea of what's Happening here it is trying to find the average between two various maximal points it's trying to find the optimal area between two ranges in two different directions of whatever your policy is in this case the policy is going to be to find the right stock picks at the right time so it's already given us an example using stable Baseline stable baselines is open ai's own library for reinforcement learning and it's using in three lines of code the proximal policy algorithm on a environment that is has nothing to do with stock prices so we want to replace it with a stock price environment so let's go to GitHub and we'll type in stable baselines we're going to type in not just stable Baseline but open AI because openai made stable baselines and we'll type in financial just to see if we can find anything that's Financial related and under code and it turns out that if we just type in that the first result is going to be this fin RL Library by the AI for finance Foundation very cool stuff under examples they have a an IPython notebook that shows how to use deep reinforcement learning on real-time data to make predictions so let's go to that demo by using what openai told us it's what chat GPT told us it said use reinforcement learning use proximal policy optimization and here's a python example but there's not an exact way to do that using the existing codes we're going to take a little detour here and use this library right here finrl to make those predictions so let's open that up in our own collab notebook and as you can see I've opened it up right here now what this is going to do let's go through this step by step the first thing it's going to do is going to install this repository into the browser after it's installed its dependencies and you can see a lot of code here then it's going to create some folders to save all of this data as it trains on once it's pulled the data now how is it pulling the data what it's using right here is the Yahoo downloader so it's pulling data in re from whatever date ranges we choose but we're going to switch that with the alpaca API once it's pulled that data it's going to show it in terms of all of the variables that are a part of that data and it's going to find 30 days of stock data for all 30 of these tickers from Apple all the way down to the Dow and then it's going to add what are called technical indicators to those uh rows so all of those single stocks are also going to have these very popular technical indicators which are known in the community once it has their technical indicators then we're going to create a Markov decision process what is a Markov decision process this is a this is an idea in reinforcement learning where you have an agent in an environment and it takes a step at every given time step a Markov decision process is a way to frame this process in such a way that it is mathematically possible to define a policy that means how should this agent be acting at every time step and so what is the policy for us the agent first of all is going to be this AI that is a neural network specifically a proximal policy optimization neural network and the environment is the financial Market what this library is going to do is it's going to pull that real-time data into a simulated environment train this deep reinforcement learning agent in that simulated environment and then use the alpaca API to make real trades based on the output of that every single day I will then deploy that to the web and it's going to run every single day for me okay so that's what's happening here I'm defining the variables for this deep reinforcement learning Ensemble agent so it's actually running three different strategies a2c PPO and ddpg now remember chat GPT showed us what those reinforcement learning strategies were okay so once it's trained and you can see all this training data it's going to show a back test and what a back test is is it's a way for an automated system without biases to make predictions based on previous data now you and I we can't do that because we're biased we would just pick if we already know what it's going to be what the price could be but as you can see here on this test that I ran earlier you can see that the green line is the actual values and the gray line is the return that our bot made so that means that on that data it made it returned better than the market so now it's up to us do we want to use that to buy and it's always going to change right based on every day if if a given day is two percent profit do I want to buy or do I want to sell what I'm going to do is I'm going to Define a threshold and I'm going to say if the sharp ratio is above say 0.4 in this case I'm just randomly saying a number go ahead and buy Nvidia stock if it's not sell and that's it and I want to let that run for five days and it's just going to run on a web app so that's the idea do we have anything else to ask chat GPT we have this thing uh oh yeah we need to add the alpaca API to it and you can see it right here so this is going to make trades based on the bot okay so let's connect the bot that's already trained to the alpaca API so with this single function it can make that trade with one function programmatically given the secret and the public key so what is our web app even doing well it's running a collab notebook once a day from start to finish at a given interval that's it and then it's going to make a trade if that reinforcement learning library says to make a trade so how do I get it to do that well we need to run what's called a Cron job so let's ask trap GPT what that is and then how to do that so let's say I want to run this AI trading bot once a day the way to do that is with a Cron job apparently because Raj said so right is with a Cron job what is a Cron job and write me one in flask in Python flask because I want this to be a flask API in Python flask to deploy to versal which is my favorite deployment platform um and it runs once a day it just runs a Google collab once a day that's it a Cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified intervals on a Linux or Unix based system perfect that's exactly what we wanted so it's telling us how to run this with the python code so with this single class file of code we can ask versal to run this collab notebook once a day at every you know at 8 AM let's say 8 A.M and it's going to buy the stock and then it's gonna if it's good enough right if the AI agent if the PPO agent has a predicts a sharp ratio that is above my threshold then it will buy else it will hold and if it's below a certain ratio it will sell let's say 0.2 so 0.4 is the upper threshold and 0.2 is a minimum threshold so that's the script and we're going to deploy it to Virtual with terminal so I'm going to take that go back to my code that was hosted locally and I'm going to deploy this with my white labeled uh Firebase starter package here that you guys can find on my GitHub by the way gbt Trader make it whatever you want but it's got Firebase and everything integrated so that's that's how this is going to work I'm going to take it deploy to Virtual and right now I have deposited money into my Live account but I'm still waiting on that deposit so once that deposit is complete I'm gonna let the bot make a trade and I'm going to come back in 24 hours and let's see how much money it's made all right here we go okay it's been 24 hours and after investing over two thousand dollars it's made four trades and made a total of 1.62 profit not bad thank you guys so much for watching subscribe if you liked the video hit that like button it really helps promote the video and for now I've got to go catch GPT myself so thanks for watching [Music]

If you're looking for a complete SQL tutorial for beginners with examples, this tutorial is a great way to learn SQL basics. Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time. 

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a language used by software developers, data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL, you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information. 

There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course, we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server), you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.",2,"Hi, my name is Mosh Hamedani, and I'm  super excited to be your instructor. In this three hour course, you're going to learn everything  you need to get started with SQL or SQUEL. First I'm going to give you a three minute introduction to SQL, then we're going to install the necessary  tools and write our first SQL query. This course is ideal for anyone who wants to learn SQL from scratch, but also  anyone with some basic knowledge who wants to fill in the missing gaps. By the end  of this course, you'll be able to retrieve insert, update, and  delete data in databases. We'll talk about tables, relationships,  different types of joints, sub-queries regular expressions and  much, much, more. These are the essential concepts every software developer  or data scientist must know. This SQL course is packed with tons  of exercises that help you both learn and remember the SQL syntax. Also, there is a table of content below this video so you can quickly jump to specific tutorials, now let's jump in and get started.  Let's start the course with a quick overview of databases, what they are and  how we use them. A database is a collection of data stored  in a format that can be easily accessed. In order to manage our databases, we use a software application called database management system,  or, DBMS. We connect to a DBMS and give it  instructions for querying or modifying data. The DMBS will execute our instructions and send results back. Now we have  several database management systems out there, and these are classified into two categories, relational and non relational, also  called NoSQL. In relational databases, we store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships. That's why we call these databases relational databases, each table  stores data about a specific type of object, like customer product, order and so on. SQL or SQUEL is the language that we use to work with these relational database management systems. It looks like this. We use SQL to query or modify our data. In this course you're going to learn everything there is to know about this powerful  language. Now, there are many different relational database management systems,  out there, some of the most popular ones are MySQL, SQL Server my Microsoft, and Oracle. But of course, there are plenty  more. Each database management system has a different flavor of SQL.  But all these implementations are very similar and are based on the standard SQL specification. So most of the SQL  code that you will learn in this course will work with any database management system.  In this course, we'll be using MySQL, which is the most popular  open source database in the world. Okay, now back to this diagram,  what about non relational databases? In non relational databases,  we don't have tables or relationships, these databases are different from relational databases, but that's a topic for an entirely different course.  What you need to know is non relational database systems  don't understand SQL. They have their own query language.  So, we use SQL to work with relational database management  systems. Now, before we jump in and install MySql, let me clarify  something quickly, as you talk to different people, you will hear two different pronunciations  of SQL. SQUEL, or SQL.  What is the correct way? Well, it depends on who you ask, and of course everybody thinks their way of pronouncing this word is the right way. But here's a  history about this language. SQL was originally developed at IBM in the 70s and back then it was initially called SQUEL short for structured English query language. But they changed the acronym to SQL, because SQUEL was the trademark of an airplane  company. So to this day, there has been an argument about what is the right generally speaking, people in non-English speaking  countries call it SQL. I'm used to calling it SQUEL because it's shorter and sweeter than SQL. But if you prefer to call it SQL, that's totally fine with me, I'm not going to get mad at you. So that's the history behind this language. But what about MySQL as a  software product? Developers of this product prefer to call it MySQL rather than mySQL. But they don't mind if they call it MySQL.  In this course, I'll be teaching you SQL with MySQL.  Hey guys, Mosh here. I just wanted to let you know that  you really don't have to memorize anything in this course, because I've created a  complete cheat sheet with summary notes for you. You can find it below this video  in the description box. So I have done my best to create the best possible, most comprehensive SQL course for you, and I would really appreciate it if you would support my hard work by liking and sharing this  video. Thank you so much, now, let's continue.  In this tutorial,  I'm going to show you how to install MySQL on your computer. Now I'm using a Mac, so first I will show you how to install MySQL on a Mac  computer, and then I will show you how to install it on Windows. So if you're a Windows user,  feel free to skip this tutorial. Now, open up your browser and head over to MySQL.com. Then, go to the downloads page, and scroll down to the bottom. Here you should see MySQL community edition, this is absolutely  free, and we're going to use that throughout this course. So let's go ahead  and look at that, now on this page, click on MySQL,  community server, and then on this page,  you should see available releases for Mac OS.  So, in this list, download the first item which is a dmg archive.  Alright, now, on the next page, click on no thanks, just start my download. Okay, as you can see, we are getting a dmg file, which is basically a setup wizard.  Alright, now the DMG is downloaded, so let's open it,  and then double click on this package, this will launch an installation wizard which is pretty easy to use, so simply  click on continue and again, and again,  agree with the license agreement, and  install MySQL, it's going to ask for your password, this is the password  that you used to log into your computer, so let's put that here,  alright, now here we need to set a password to the root for the admin user. So click next, and  in this box, type a complex password,  alright, now, let's finish the installation,  and enter your computer's password one more time,  and we are done!  That was super easy and sweet.  Alright, we installed MySQL community server, now we  need the graphical tool to connect with this server and manage our databases.  So, back to the downloads page, one more time,  scroll to the bottom, and go to MySQL  community addition, and on this page, somewhere  you should see MySQL workbench. This is a graphical tool that we use to connect to our database server. So let's go ahead and  download this as well. Now once again on this page, we need to download a dmg archive, so,  download, and, again we have  to say no we don't want to login or sign up, so let's go ahead and download  the dmg, and then  open it, alright, you're going to see something like this, so  drag this MySQL workbench and drop it onto the applications folder.  So, let's go ahead with that, now it's going to copy  this into the applications folder, beautiful,  so we're done with the installation, that was super easy, now press command and space, and search for MySQL,  work bench, there you go, let's open it, now the  first time we get this message, because this is an application we downloaded from the internet.  So, we need to tell Mac that we trust this, let's go ahead with that,  so this is MySQL workbench, now by default  you see a connection here, if you don't see that, you need to create it. Let me show you how to do that. So for this demo I'm going to right click this and delete this connection, alright,  now let's create a connection from scratch. So click on this plus icon,  on this page, give this connection a name, let's  say local instance, now the connection method  we're going to use is tcip, which is set by default, the  host name is 127.0.0.1, which  is the address of the local machine, and the port is 33 06, this is the default port for MySQL server, that is the user name of the admin, now we need to enter the password. This is the password that we set during the installation. So, click on  store in keychain, and in this box, type the  password for the MySQL server. Alright  and finally, let's test the  connection, okay, we successfully connected to MySQL server on the local machine, beautiful, let's click okay,  and here we have a connection on the homepage of MySQL workbench, every time we open MySQL workbench, we use this connection to connect to our local server. Alright, we're done with the installation of MySQL on a Mac, next I will talk about MySQL on a Windows computer, so feel free to skip that tutorial. In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to install MySQL on Windows. So open up your browser and head over to MySQL.com, then, go to the downloads page now here, scroll down to the bottom,  we're going to use MySQL community edition which is absolutely  free. So, let's go with this, now,  select MySQL community server,  and then scroll down so here you should see something like this, MySQL installer for Windows. This is the  recommended method for installing MySQL on Windows. So,  click on this, alright, on the next page, scroll down,  and  download the first installer here. On the next page  scroll downs nd click on no thanks just start my  download. Otherwise you have to create an account and log, which is unnecessary for knowing this course, so, let's go with this,  and save this file to our computer, and then  run it.  Alright, we're going to use this setup wizard to install MySQL,  on our computer.  This is very easy, all you have to do is click next,  but there are a couple places where you need to enter a password, let me show you. So, on the first page, for the setup type we're going to use the  developer default setup. Go to the next page. Now here we're getting a little warning, because this installation wizard wants to install the connector for python 3.7, but I don't have Python on this machine, so that's why I'm getting this warning, now on your  machine, you might or you might not get this error, just click  next, and one more time, so here are the products that I want to get installed the first one is MySQL server,  the second one is MySQL workbench, this is the graphical tool that we use to connect to our database server, and manage our database.  You're going to see that soon. So click on execute,  now this is going to take about 5-10 minutes, so,  I'm going to pause the recording.  Alright, all the products are installed, beautiful, let's go to the next page,  and again, here our the group replication  page, also click on next, and the next page which is  about networking, leave all the default settings, so,  let's go to the next page, now we should set a password for the root for  the admin user. So, click on next,  and in this box, type a password for the admin user.  Alright, and then  let's go to the next page, once again leave all the default settings,  and click on next, and execute one more time,  alright, and now  let's finish our installation, once again we have to click on next,  and then finish. One more time,  there are so many steps. Now here's the page where you need to enter the admin password, so the page is called connect to server, you can see the username is root, which represents the admin user,  so in this box enter the password that you said earlier,  then click on check, okay, connection was successful  beautiful, let's go to the next page, and  click on execute, and finally finish.  There you go, we have one more step, next the  finally after all these steps the installation is complete. Now, this is going to start, MySQL workbench, which is the graphical tool we use to manage our database and run SQL queries.  So, click on finish, so now we have a command  prompt window, where we can type instructions to talk to our MySQL server,  we don't really need this, so close it,  and here's MySQL workbench, now the first time you open this page,  by default you should see a connection here, if you don't see it,  click on this plus icon,  on this page give this connection a name, let's say local  instance, now leave all their settings to their default value,  but here for the password click on store involved.  And in this box, type the password that you used for the admin user.  So, I'm going to put that here, okay,  now click on test connection,  alright, we successfully connected to the MySQL server on this  computer, alright, then, click on okay,  now we click on this connection to connect to our database server.  Alright, so here's the interface you'll be using throughout this course,  on the left hand side we have the navigator panel, in the middle we have the query editor which we can resize  this is where we're going to write our SQL queries, and on the right side we have  additions. So we're done with MySQL  on our computer, next, I'm going to show you how to create our databases for this query.  In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create the databases for this course. So here I've got MySQL workbench open, let me quickly give you an overview of this interface because  the first time you open it it might appear a little bit intimidating.  But actually it's not that difficult. So here on the top we have this tool bar with these buttons for creating a new tab for writing SQL code  as well as opening a SQL file. And next to that  we've got a bunch of buttons for creating a database, creating new tables and  so on. On the left side, we've got the navigator panel with two tabs  administration and schemas. We use the administration tab to do administrative work, such as starting or stopping our server. Importing or exporting data and so on. The schemas  tab shows the databases that we have in the current database server.  So currently we only have one database, that is sis, and this is the database that MySQL uses internally to do it's work.  Now, in the middle we've got this query editor window, this is where we write our SQL code, so we'll be spending most of our time in this course, in this window, and on the right side we've got another panel with two tabs,  contacts held, and snippets, now chances are this interface  might look slightly different on Windows, but what I'm showing you here is  almost identical to what we have on Windows. So don't get hung up if it  looks slightly different on your machine. It doesn't really matter. Now up here,  we've got these buttons for showing or hiding these panels, so to clean this interface, I'm going to hide this panel on the right side.  As well as the panel on the bottom. That is better. Now,  to create the databases for this course, download the zip file attached,  below this video. When you extract the (?) you're going to see a bunch of SQL files like this. So the main one you'll be using in this tutorial is called create databases.SQL. So this file contains all the SQL code to create all the databases that we need  in this course, now we also have individual files for creating  individual databases, I've just added these files in case you need to recreate  one of these databases in the future. But for now don't worry about them. Now,  back to MySQL work bench, let's open  the main SQL file. That is create databases.  So this is an example of SQL code.  Now this may look complex at the beginning, but trust me, as you go through the course  you're going to understand exactly how everything works here. You're going to be able to write SQL code like this. So, you want to execute  this, to create all the databases for this course. To do that, we click  on this icon, this yellow thunder icon that we have  on this tool bar here. This will execute either the selection or the  entire code if there is nothing selected for example, if I select this line here,  and click on this icon, this will execute only this line. In this case we want to execute the entire code, so we shouldn't select anything,  and now let's execute this, beautiful, now here down on the bottom,  we have this panel called the output window that shows all the  operations perform in our database server, so we can see  all the operations completed successfully, or something went wrong.  As you can see you've got these green ticks next to each operation.  Beautiful, so I'm going to close this panel, that's better.  Now on the left side in this schemas tab you don't see this new database  so we'll have to refresh this view, beautiful.  So we've got all these databases that are prefixed with SQL or SQL, I decided to prefix them with SQL so we know that  these are the databases for this course, they don't accidentally clash with  a database on the same name of your database server. Now,  at the time of recording this video, there are only 4 databases here, but as we go through  the course, I'm going to update the script for creating the databases, so,  when you watch this course, chances are you're going to see more databases here. Don't worry  worry about the difference. Now as an example let's explore  these databases. And by the way we don't need this tab anymore so let's close it.  That's better. Let's expand the SQL store database, now in every database we have these objects, we have  tables, this is where we store our data, we have views,  which are kind of like virtual cables, so we can combine data from multiple  tables, and put them in a view. And this is especially powerful  for creating reports, you're going to learn about them in the future. You also have  store procedures and functions, and these are little programs that we  stored inside of our database for querying data. For example,  you can have a store procedure for getting all the customers in a given city.  So we call that procedure and we say hey, give me all the customers in San Francisco  And this will return all the customers in San Francisco.  Okay, now, let's expand the tables,  so here are the tables in this database. We have customers,  we have orders, products, shippers and so on.  Now, select this customers table whenever you hover your mouse  over this item and see these three items on the right side.  Click on the right most icon, that looks like a table with a  thunder. With this we can see all the data, in this  table. So this is our customers table. In this table, we have these columns like customer id which we use to uniquely identify  customers. We all have first name, last name, birth  date, phone, address and so on. So these are the columns  in this table and every row is called a  record. So every row represents one customer and these are the pieces of  information we know for each customer. Now let's look at  another table, let's open the orders table,  in this table we have these columns like order ID, customer ID,  order date, status, and so on. What is this customer ID here.  We use this column to identify who has placed  each order. Now what is interesting here is you have referred to this customer  using their customer ID which uniquely identifies that.  In other words, if Jon Smith has placed an order, we don't  store John Smith here, we only store John's customer ID.  Why is that? Here is the reason. It is possible  John Smith might have placed multiple orders in our system.  Now every time John places his order, we need to look up his address and  phone to ship his order. Now it is possible that some of this information  might change in the future. John might move to a new place or change his  phone number, he might even change his name, if you repeat all that information next to each order, then we'll have to come back and make changes in multiple places. In contrast, with this design we only  store the ID of john here, so anytime we want to change  any information about John, instead of changing that here. We go back to our customers table, so let's look at  customer with ID 6, that is actually called (?) So here is all the information about Elka. This is her phone number, this is her address, and by the way this is all dummy data that I created using a tool.  So, if any information about elka changes in the future,  this is the only place that we need to modify. So  this is how these databases work. We refer to these databases as  relational databases. That basically means in these kind of databases we have  multiple tables that are related to each other using  a relationship. So internally there is a relationship between the customers table, and the orders table. So the customer  ID column in the customers table is related  or linked or associated with the customer ID column.  In the orders table. Here's the orders table, and here we have  the customer ID column. So this was a brief introduction to  relational databases, you learned about databases, tables,  columns, rows and relationships. In the next section I'm going to show you how to retrieve data from a single table in this database.  But, before going any further as an exercise I want you to explore  the invoicing database. Look at the all the tables, look at all the data to get an id of the kind of data that we have in this database. You're going to use this database  a lot in the future, so let's spend a couple minutes to explore this database.  In this tutorial I'm going to show you how  to retrieve data from a single panel. Now look at the navigator panel.  Currently none of our databases is displayed in bold, and that means none of these databases are selected for query. So the first step to rate a query to get data from a database, is to select a database.  The query that we'll write will be executed against that database.  In this demo, we're going to use the SEQUEL store database.  So we type our use SQL_ store. Now use is a keyword in the SQL language, and that's  displayed in blue. Now SQL is not a case sensitive language,  and that means we can use upper case or lower case characters, it doesn't really  matter, but as a best practice, we should capitalize the  SQL keywords, and use lower case characters for everything else.  So now, let's go ahead and execute this query. Alright,  Look, the SQL store database is now displayed in bold.  Now in MySQL workbench, we can also select a database  by double clicking that, so now I double click SQL invoice  and it's the current database. Now if we run this query again,  the SQL store database becomes selected.  Alright, now let's write our first query to retrieve all the customers in this database. So after the you statement we're going to use  select statement. Here is the basic syntax or basic structure  of the select statement, we type out select in front  of that we specify the columns that we want to retrieve, for example we can retrieve  the customer ID column as well as the first name column or  we can retrieve all columns using an asterisk.  Now after that we use the from clause and this is where we specify the  table that we want to query, in this case the customer's table.  So this is the simplest query to select all the customers in a given table,  now whenever you have multiple SQL statements you need to terminate each statement using a semicolon. So,  look, we have a red underline here that indicates an error, if you hover your mouse over here,  you can see this tool tip saying select is not valid at this position.  Because we didn't terminate the first statement with a semi colon.  Okay, now let's execute this query one more time, once again,  we can click on this button here, or we can use a short cut,  so look at the query menu on the top, the first line is execute. Now here's the shortcut for this command, on Mac, it's shift  command and enter. On Windows its going to be different honestly  I'm not sure. So whatever it is, use that. So I'm going to press  shift command enter, and here are  all the customers in this table. So this  next statement has two clauses, the select clause and the  from clause. But there are other clauses we can use to filter  and sort data. For example, you can use the wear clause  to filter the result and get the customer with ID one. So we can write an expression like this. Where  _ID = 1. Now when we execute this  query, we'll only get the customer with ID  1. So this is the where clause. We can also sort  the data so after wear we use the order by  clause and here we specify the columns that we're going to sort the results from on. Let's say we want to sort these customers by their first name so we type out  first_name. That is the name of one of the columns in this  table, right? Now if you execute this query this order by doesn't really have  an impact, because we only get one record in the result  so let me temporarily take out the where clause,  to do that we can put two hyphens in front of this line, now this line,  is treated as a comment, which means the SQL engine is not going to execute this, okay, so let's execute this query one more time,  now all the customers that we get our sorted  based on their first name. So that's the basic idea.  Now over the next few tutorials your'e going to learn more about these clauses in detail. But what you need to take away in this tutorial is that  is that these 3 clauses from where an order by are  optional. As you can see in this example, I'm not using the where clause,  we can also comment out the order by clause, we can also comment  out the from clause, so instead of selecting all the columns,  in a given table, we can select some values like one and two. Now,  if you execute this query one more time, in the result, we get something like this. Two columns called one and two, and in these columns  we have these values. So all these clauses are optional but in the  real world we quite often use all of them. Now what you need to understand here is that  the order of these clauses matter, so we always have select first,  then we have from, then where, and finally order by.  We cannot change the order of these clauses, otherwise we get a syntax error.  Which basically means the syntax, or the grammar or the structure  of our simple statement is incorrect. So it cannot be executed.  And one last thing before we finish this tutorial, you can see I've listed all these clauses on a  new line, now technically you don't have to do this, because line breaks, white spaces and tabs are ignored  when executing SQL statements. So we could come back here and  put from in front of select, so select store  from customers all in one line, and that's perfectly acceptable for simple queries,  but as your queries get more complex, it's better to put each clause on a new line. So that's all for this tutorial. In the next  tutorial, we'll explore the select  clause in detail.  In this tutorial, we're going to look at the select clause in detail.  So, since our current database is SQL store, to  clean things up I'm going to remove the first statement, you don't really need it now,  also, I'm going to delete these two comments, we just want  to focus on the select clause. Alright, so what can we do with this select clause? Well in the last tutorial we learned that if you use  an asterisk, this will return all the columns. Alternatively we can specify  the columns that we want and this is helpful in situations where you have a  big table with so many columns and perhaps millions of record.  If you want to bring back all that data, that's going to put a lot of pressure  on the database server, in this case MySQL, as well as the network.  So, that's when we explicitly specify the columns that we  want to get. Let's say we want to get the first name  and last name columns. Execute the query, as you can see, we only get these two columns.  And they are in the same order we specified here. So if we  change the order and put the last name first and execute the  query again, now we can see the last name column comes first.  Now let's add a new column, at the end, let's get the points for each customer as well, run the query, so these are the points for each customer which are calculated based on their shopping.  Now let's say we want to get these points and put them in a mathematical formula  to calculate the discount that we can give to each customer.  So here we can use an arithmetic expression, that's points plus ten.  This is an arithmetic expression. So now we can execute this query  for the first record you can see that their points will end up being 2283. Let's run the query one more time there you go. Now we can put the original points column here for clarity.  So points, points plus 10. Let's run the query one more time, now you can see the original points, and next  to that you can see the value that we're going to use to calculate the discount.  Now here we're using the plus operator which is for addition, we also have  multiplication, division, subtraction, and  module which is the remainder of the division. So let's change this to something  more complex. Let's say we want to get the points, multiply by 10,  and then add 100 to it.  Now we can immediately see that this line one is getting too long  and it doesn't fit on the screen, in situations like this, you can break up the select clause by placing each column on a new line, so,  select last name, then first name  points finally points times 10,  plus 100. So let's execute this query one more time.  So this is our new column with the new calculated value.  Now one thing you need to understand in this arithmetic expression is the order  of operators, and this is based on the order of operators in math.  So in math, the multiplication and division  operators have nighter precedence then addition and subtraction, so in this expression, points is multiplied by 10 and then the result is added  to 100. If this is not what you want you can always change the order by using parenthesis, as an example, let's change this multiplication to addition and then put that  multiplication here. In this expression, first 10 is  multiplied by 100, and then the result is added to the points.  Now let's say this is not what we want, so we can change the order by using parenthesis here.  With these parenthesis, first we get the points add 10 to them  and then multiply the result by 100. So this parenthesis are useful for changing the order of operations as well as  adding clarity to our code. So someone else reading this code can easily understand.  the order of these operations. Now let's execute this query one more time,  alright, now look at the name of this column here,  its set to the expression that we have on line 5.  That doesn't quite make sense you want to have a clear descriptive name,  so we can give this column an alias using the as keyword.  So, as and then we give it a name like discount  discount _factor. Let's run the query again.  now the name of this column has changed, so this is the  benefit of using an alias, we can give descriptive names to the  columns and the results sets. Now if you want to have a space in the  column name, you need to surround it with quotes, either  single, or double quotes. So we put quotes here and then  we can add a space in between these two words. Let me  execute the query one more time. Now we have discount factor. So let's quickly recap everything you learned about the select  clause. We cause an asterisk to return the columns, or  we can explicitly specify the columns that you want to return.  We can also use, arithmetic expressions here, and optionally, we can even  gibe an alias to each column in the results set. Now there is one more thing you need to know about the select clause. So let's delete this query  and select the state column,  of the customers table. Take a look. These are the  states in which our customers our located. Now currently in the sample  data we don't have any duplicates, in other words we don't have multiple customer in any of these states. But for this demo I want to change the  state of the first customer to Virginia, so we end up with duplicates  in the result set. So let's open up navigator panel here's our customers table, let's look at all the data,  and here's our first customer,  here a you can see, it's located in the state of Massachusetts  now I want to change this to Virginia. So double click VA for Virginia, enter, now  on the bottom right corner of the screen, you should see two buttons,  apply and revert. Unfortunately I cannot show you this button  because the recording window is a bit smaller then MySQL  But look down in the bottom right hand corner, click and apply. You're going to see a dial up box like this asking you to review the changes, so go ahead and click that button one more time alright, now, let's go back to our first query window, and execute this query one more time.  As you can see, the first two customers are located in Virginia. What if you wanted to get a unique list of states in the results set, that's when we use a distinct  keyword. So select distinct set.  With his query, we'll retrieve a unique list of states from the  customers table. So with the distinct keyword we can remove  let's execute the query one more time, now you can see Virginia is not duplicated.  Alright here's an exercise for you.  I want you to write a SQL query to return all the products in our database  in the result set. I want to see three columns, name,  unit price, and a new column called new price which is based on this expression, unit price  times 1.1. So let's say you want to increase the price of each product by 10%. With this query you want to get all the products  the original price and the new price. So pause the video and spend  one or two minutes on this exercise, when you are done come back and see my solution.  Alright this is pretty easy, so we start with select  now what columns do we want to select? Name, unit _price and then here we're going to use an arithmetic  expression to calculate the new price. So we type  out unit price times 1.1 and then give it a  alias, o as new_price or we can put this in quotes  and put a space between new and price. Now where do we want to select these columns from? From the products table, so from  products. Note that I've used upper case characters for all the SQL keywords and lowercase characters for everything else. So,  let's go ahead and execute tis query, this is what we get  so these are all the products, you can see their original price  as well as the new price which is 10 % more expensive.  In this tutorial, we're going to look at the where clause in SQL. So earlier I told you that we use the where clause to filter  data. For example, let's say we only want to get the customers with  points greater than 3000. So here in the where clause you can type out the condition like this. Points, greater than  3000. When we execute this query, the query execution engine in MySQL is going to iterate over all the customers  in the customers table. For each customer it's going to evaluate this condition  if this condition is true, it will return that customer in the  result set. So let's go ahead and execute this,  and here's the result, as you can see you only have two customers  with points greater than 3000.  So, thesis what we call the greater than operator which is one of the  comparison operators in SQL. Let me show you the completeness of comparison  operators, so, we have  greater than, greater than, or equal to, we have less then,  less than or equal to, here's the equality  operator, and for not equality, we can use an exclamation  followed by an equal sign, or something like this. So both  of these are not equal operators. Let me show you examples of  these operators. So I'm going to delete all these and bring back the previous query, let's say we want to get only the customers in the state of Virginia. So we can change our condition to something like this.  Where state equals Virginia.  Note that I've put Virginia in quotes, because this is what we call a  string. A string is a sequence of characters. So whenever you're dealing with a sequence of characters, or basically textural data, we  need to enclose your values with either single or double quotes.  But quite often, by convention, we use single quotes  so let's execute this query and here's the result, you can see we only have these two customers with ID 1 and 2, who are located in Virginia. And it doesn't matter if you use upper case or lower case characters, so if you type out the a in lower case and execute the query you get the exact same result. Now what if you want to get all the customers  outside of the state of Virginia, you can use the not equal operator.  So, we can either prefix this with an exclamation  or use this other notation.  Either way we get the same result. So these are  the customers that are not located in Virginia. Now we can  use these comparison operators for date values as well. For example,  let's say you want to get only the customers born after January  1st, 1990. So we change out condition to first date, greater then, once again we use quotes,  for representing date values even though dates are actually not  strings. But in the sequel language, we should enclose dates with quotes,  so, here we type out 1990,  01 for January, -01 for date. So this is the standard or default format for representing  dates in MySQL. 4 digits for the year, two digits for the month, and 2 digits for the day. So let's go ahead and execute this query. I actually made a mistake here, so we don't see the  result, instead we see the action output, or the output window. If you scroll to the bottom, you can see the details of the error. So here I used  the wrong name for the column, which should separate these two words with an underscore. That is the name of our column. So,  let's execute the query one more time, so we only have 3 customers born after January 1st 1990. So these  are examples of comparison operators in SQL. In the next tutorial I'm going to show you how to combine multiple conditions when filtering data.  Alright, here's your exercise. I want you to write a query to get the  orders that are placed this year, so look at the orders table, see what columns to do we have there, and based on that write query with a  where clause.  So here's the orders table, in this table we have this column, order date. We can use this problem to see the orders that are placed this year  so here's our query, select, start from order  where order_date, is  greater than or equal to 2019, assuming  this is the current yer, so 2019, 0101.  Now since currently we are in the year 2019, this query will return all the orders placed this year. But next year this query  is not going to give us the right result. But don't worry about it, later in the course I will show you how to write a query to get the orders placed in the current year,  so for the purpose of the new exercise, this is a valid solution. Now let's execute this query and see what we get. So, we have  only one order, order ID 1, that is placed in the current  year.  In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to combine multiple search conditions when filtering data. So, let's say you want to get all the customers that were born after January 1st, 1990, who also happen to have more then  1000 points. So this is where we use the and operator.  So we type out and, and after we type out another condition.  Like points, greater than 1000.  Now when we execute this query, we only get customers who have  both these conditions. Let's take a look, so execute  we only have 2 customers and if you look both these people are born after 1990, and they have more then  1000 points. So this is the and operator. When we use this  operator, both these conditions should be true. In contrast to the and  operator, we have the or operator. So with or if at least one of these conditions is true, that row will be returned in the  result set. Let's take a look. Now we execute this query again,  2 records we have quite a few records. So for example,  we have this person who's not born after 1990  but if you look at their points they have more then 1000 points.  So any customer records that satisfies at least one of these conditions will be returned. Now let's take this to the next level. Let's say we want to get customers who are either born after 1990, or  they should have at least 1000 points and live in Virginia  so this is how we do this, we type out and  and then we add another condition, state equals  Virginia. Let's execute this query and see what we get. We only get 4 records, so these are the customers that are either born after 1990 or they have more then 1000 points and live  in Virginia. If you look at the first customer here this person is not born after 1990. But you can see that she lives in Virginia and she has more than 1000 points. So the last two conditions.  are true for this customer. Now when combining multiple logical operators. You need to be aware of the order of these operators.  So earlier I talked about he order of arithmetic operators. I told you that multiplication have a higher order then addition and  subtraction. And we can use parenthesis to override  the default order. We have the same concept in logical operator  So the and operator is always evaluated first.  So when this query is executed, the query execution engine  first evaluates this condition, because here we're using an and it doesn't matter that we typed out this condition after the first condition.  Because the and operator has a higher precedence. Now you can always change the order using parenthesis. And this also makes your code cleaner  and easier to understand. So here we can put parenthesis,  around these last two conditions,  and also we can put these in a  new line for  clarity. Something like this. So anyone  who reads this code can easily understand what is the intent of this query.  Now we also have logical operator called  not. And we use that to negate a condition. So,  I'm going to simplify our where clause. Let's say we're searching for customers who were born after 1990 or  we have more then 1000 points. If we execute this query  we get these people. Customers with  ID 1, 3, 5 and so on. Now we can use the not operator  to negate this condition. So we apply not here, and  preferably we also put parenthesis around this condition.  Now when we execute this query, we see other customers that are not  in the current results set. Let's take a look. So,  instead of customers with id's 1356 and so on, we get customers with id's 2 4 and 10.  Now technically these customers were born before 1990. And we have less then 1000 points. So if you look here,  this first customer was born before 1990 and  he has less then 1000 points. How do they know that? Let me show you a trick that I learned in math. Whenever you have a not  operator. You can simplify your expression like this. We apply the not operator  to the first condition. People who were born after 1990, how can we negate this condition? Well,  the greater than operator becomes less then or equal to.  That is the inverse of that condition. Now we  apply the not to or to negate the or. What do we get? We get and. Finally apply the not operator on the last condition. We both have more then 1000 points.  When we negate this condition we get customers with less then or equal  to 1000 points. Now, you can remove the not operator  to simplify this, we don't need parenthesis anymore because we  only have 2 conditions that are combined with an end. Here is the result.  As you can see, this is much easier to read and understand  people who were born before this day and they have less then 1000 points  Alright, here's your exercise. From the order items  table, get the items for order number 6,  where the total price for the total item is greater then  30.  Alright, here's the order items table, in this table we have these columns order id, product id, quality, and unit  price. If we multiply the quantity by unit price we can  get the total cost of that item. And then we can compare it with  30. So, let's go ahead and write this query.  Select star  from order items. Where  here we need two conditions one is for order, so order  _id should be 6, and the second condition  we want to calculate the total price. So we get the unit price multiply it by quantity and this  value should be greater than 30. So as you can see,  we can use an arithmetic expression in the where clause. It's not limited  to the select clause. Okay? Now let's execute this query and see what we get. We should get only 1 item,  that is for product 1, here in quantities 4 and unit price  is just over 8 dollars, so the total price for this item, is greater than 30.  Hey guys, Mosh here.  In case you haven't seen my website yet, head over to codewithmosh.com.  This is my coding school where you can find plenty of courses  on web and mobile application development. In fact recently I  published a complete SQL course that is about 10 hours long,  and it teaches you everything you need to know from the basic to advanced topics  such as database design, security, writing complex queries,  transactions, events, and much much more. These are the topics that every software engineer must master. This YouTube course  you're watching, is the first 3 hours of my complete SQL course that is about 10 hours long. So if you want to master SQL and get job ready, I highly encourage you to enroll in my  complete SQL course. You can watch it anytime, anywhere, as many times as you want, you can watch it online or download the videos. The course comes  with a 30 day money back guarantee, and a certificate of completion  that you can add to your resume. The price for this course is $149 dollars, but the first 200 students can get it for just over  10 dollars. So if you're interested the link is below this video.  In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to use the  in operator in SQL. So, as an example, let's say you want to get the customers that are in Virginia or Florida, or Georgia. One way to write this query is like this. So, where state equals Virginia, or  a state equals Georgia, or a state equals Florida. Now people who are new to the SQL language or  programming in general find this expression a little bit strange.  They ask, ""Mosh, why can't we write this expression like this?"" where state equals Virginia or Georgia or  Florida. Here's the reason, we use the or operator  to combine multiple conditions. So here we have a condition  or an expression more accurately, but on the right side of this or operator  we have a string. In SQL we cannot combine a string  with a boolean expression that expresses a boolean value which can be  true or false. So that is why we have to write our query  like this. So we have multiple expressions or multiple conditions  and we're combining them using the or operator.  So, now if we execute this query we get these customers here.  customers here but there is a shorter and cleaner way to get the same result.  Instead of combining multiple conditions using the or operator we can use the in operator. So, where state  is in and then in parenthesis we add all the values,  like Virginia, comma, Florida, comma Georgia and the order doesn't matter, this query is exactly equivalent  to what we had earlier, but a you can see it's shorter and easier to understand.  So, let's execute it, look, we get the exact same result. Now here we can also use the not operator. Let's say you want to get the customer's outside of these states, so we can use  rare state, not in this list.  Now if you execute this query, we get customers who are located in Colorado,  Texas and so on. So use the in operator whenever  you want to compare an attribute to a list of values.  Now here is your  exercise. I want you to write a query to get the products where  their quantity in stock equals on of these values.  49, 38, and 72, so pause the video, do this exercise, and  then come back and continue watching.  Alright, this is pretty easy, so we do a  select star to get all the columns from the products table,  where quantity in stock  in we use the in operator to compare this attribute with these values.  49, 38, and 72, let's execute the query,  we get only 2 records because we  don't have a product with quantity in stock equal to 72.  In this tutorial, we're going to look at the between operator  in SQL, so that means we want to get the customers who have more then 1000 and less then 3000 points. What made you write these queries like this? Where, points, greater than thousand, more accurately greater than or equal to 1000.  And, points less then or equal to  3000. When we execute this query we get  how many, we get 4 people that satisfy my criteria.  Now whenever you're comparing an attribute with a range of values,  you can use the between operator, and that makes your code shorter and cleaner.  So, we can rewrite this expression like this, where points,  between 1000 and 3000.  This is exactly equivalent to what we had before, so these range values are also inclusive, so that means points is going to be  greater than or equal to 1000 or greater than or equal to  3000. Let's execute the query, we get the exact same result.  Alright, now as an exercise, I want you to write a query, to get the customers  that are born between January 1st 1990 and January  21st, 2000.  Alright, so we start the  select star from customers,  where birth_date between  so what matters here is we can use the between operator  as well. It's not limited to using numbers. So with birth date between now we need to supply two date values, so as I told you before,  the format for dates is four digits for the year, so  1990, two digits for the month, and two digits for the date.  So, the birthdate should be between this value and  here's a second value. 2000, 0, 1, and  01. Let's execute this query, we get  only 3 people who match this criteria.  In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to retrieve  rows that match a specific string pattern, for example,  let's say we only want to get to customers who's last name start with  3. So, here in the where clause we type out where last name this is where we use the like operator,  and right after that we have a string pattern, so,  you want to get the customers who's last name start with b and we have  any number of characters after b. So use the  percent sign to indicate any number of characters, you may have  one character after b or no characters or 10 characters, with this pattern, you get all the customers who's patterns start with b.  And also it doesn't matter if it's an upper case or lower case b.  So, let's execute this query, there you go, so you only have  3 customers who's last name starts with b. As another  example, let's say we only want to get the customers who's last name starts with  brush. So, we change our pattern to brush,  percent. Now, let's execute the query, we only get  this one customer here. Now this percent sign doesn't have to be  at the end of the pattern, it can be anywhere. For example, let's say we want  to search for customers who have an e in their last name, whether it's at the beginning  in the middle or at the end, so we change our pattern to  percent e percent this pattern means we can  have any number of characters before or after b. Let's execute the query, these are the customers that have a b  somewhere in their last name. It doesn't matter if b is in the beginning  or in the middle or at the end. Let's look at another example,  I want to get all the customers who's last names end  with y, so here's the pattern we use,  let's execute this query, so we have 5 customers  who's last name ends with a y. So this is how we use the  percent sign. Now we also have an underscore and  that matches a single character so with this pattern you get customer  who's last name is exactly two characters long,  we don't care what the first character is, but the second character should be y.  Let's execute his for you. Obviously we don't have any customers who's last  name matches this pattern. But if you change this pattern to  5 under score, so 1234 5, followed by a y we should get  these customers. So their last name is exactly  6 characters, we don't care about the first 5 characters, but all of them end with a y. Now, as another example,  we can replace the first underscore with b, and that means  we want to get the customers who's last names start with b, and  after b we have exactly 4 characters followed by a  y. Let's execute this query. So we only have one customer,  that matches this pattern. So this is how we use the  light operator, use the percent sign to represent  any number of characters and an underscore  to represent a single character.  Now this like operator in MySQL is an older operator  but we also have a newer one that is more powerful and it allows us to search for any string patterns. And that's what I'm going to show you next.  Alright.  Here I'm going to give you two exercises for the like operator.  First, I want you to get the customers who's addresses contain trade or avenue, and next I want you to get the customers who's phone  numbers end with 9.  Alright, let's get started with the first exercise. So  start from customers where address like now here we want to use a search pattern like this.  You want to have tray (?) but tray can be anywhere in the address. So,  we put a percent before and after tray.  Next, we should use the or operator to search for another pattern.  Or address like, let me  put this on a new line that is better, address once again, percent, avenue percent, that's it.  So, let's execute this query,  here is the result, you should get the customers with ID's  2, 9, and 10. If you look at their addresses, all of them have either tray or avenue in their address. Now let's work on the second exercise, you want to get  the customers who's phone numbers end with 9. That is pretty easy,  so, let me change our where clause. Where  phone once again we use the like operator and a percent,  followed by a 9. That's all you have to do. Let's execute the  query. So, here's the result, customers with  id's 3 and 7, their phone numbers, and  9. So this is how we use the like operator. And by the way you can always use the not operator here let's say you want to get the  customers who's phone numbers don't end with 9,  so we simply prefix like with not. Now,  if we execute this query one more time, we get all the other  customers in the database.  In the last tutorial you learned about the like operator in SQL. So as another example  let's say you want to search for the customers who have the word  field in their last name. So we type out the where clause like this,  where last name, like, percent,  field, percent, so the word field,  can be anywhere in the last name. Let's execute this query, we get  only one customer, beautiful. Now we also have another operator in MySQL, that is reg x which is  short for regular expression, and regular expressions are extremely  powerful when it comes to searching for strings. So they allow us to search for more complex patterns. Here's an example. If I want to rewrite this last where clause using a regular  expression it looks like. Where last name  ragexp now here in our string pattern  we don't have to type out the person's size we only type  out field so what we have on line 4 is exactly  identical to what we have on line 3, let's execute this query  we get the same result, beautiful, now here in regular  expressions, we have additional characters that we don't have when we use the  like operator. For example, we can use the carrot sign to indicate the beginning of a string. So if I put a carrot  just before the word field, that means our  last name must start with field. Obviously, if you execute this query, we don't get anyone that matches this criteria, so we use the  carrot sign to represent the beginning of a string. We  also have a dollar sign to represent the end of a string.  So this pattern means the last name must end with field.  Let's execute this query, you get the same result as before. Now we can also search for multiple words here, for example let' say we want to find  the customers who have the word field or mac in their last name So, we use a pipe, a vertical bar,  and type out another pattern. Let's execute this query, so here we have two customers, one of them has the word  mac, the other has the word field and the last name.  Now we can take this to the next level. Let's say we want  to find the customers who have the words field, or Mac, or rows  in their last name. Let's execute the query we get 3 customers.  Beautiful. So we use a pipe or a vertical board  to represent multiple search patterns. Now as another example,  we can change our first search pattern to something like this. Now this pattern means this last name should either start  with the word field, or it should have the word mac in it or it should have the word rows. Let's execute the query, now we get only two customers, because our customer with the last name brush field doesn't match this pattern.  However, if we change our first pattern to field  $ and execute the query we get 3 people here,  3 customers. So this is how we can combine multiple special characters when building a complex pattern. Now let's look at another  example, let's say you want to search for customers who have an e in their last name.  So these are all the people, alright, now let's say  you want to make sure that before the letter e, we should either have a  g or an i. So this is where we use square brackets.  And inside the brackets we add multiple characters like g, i, m and that matches any customers who have  ge or ie or me  in their last name. So any of these characters can come before e.  Now, let's execute this query,  there you go, we only get 2 customers, and the first example before e we have i which is one of the characters  inside the brackets, in the second example, before e we have  a g which is also another valid character before  and once again the square brackets don't have to be before we could add them after e, any customers who have e  followed by an f or an m or a q in their last  name, can be returned with this pattern,  if we don't have anyone in the database so this is how we use square brackets,  now we can also supply a range of characters, for example  we can have e and just before e you can have  as many characters from a to h, you don't have to type them out explicitly like abcdefg, that's very  verbose, so, we can type out a to h.  And then if we execute this query we get these three people.  So, let's quickly recap everything you learned about regular expressions in this tutorial. Use a carrot to represent the beginning of a string, so beginning, we use a dollar sign to represent  the end of a string, we use a vertical bar or pipe,  to represent a logical or so we can supply multiple search patterns, we use square brackets to  match any single characters listed in the brackets, and finally  we use square brackets with a  hyphen to represent a range.  So any characters from a to f.  Technically MySQL supports more special characters but quite honestly, the ones that I've listed in this tutorial are the ones that you'll be using 90% of the time. So just memorize these and you're good to go. With honesty a lot of beginners find the syntax for regular expressions confusing, so in this video I'm going to give you 4 exercises that I have carefully  designed to help you quickly learn about this syntax. Here's the first exercise, get the customer's who's first names are Elka  or Ambur. And note that this is Ambur with a U.  Now for the second episode return the customer's who's names  end with ei or on.  Here's the third exercise get the customer's who's last names start with my or it contains se, and finally  as the last exercise return the customer's who's last names contain e followed by r or a u.  So, go ahead and spend 2-3 minutes on this exercise,  when you're done come back and continue watching.  Alright, let's knock out the first exercise. So we'll get  allows, there's a c here, so let's start from  regular expression, and here's our pattern, you're going to search  for two words either Elka or Ambur.  As simple as that. Let's execute this query, we should get two customers, there you go, Ambur and Elka. Alright. Now, let's knock out the second exercise. So I'm going to delete these  we don't need them anymore. So we want to get the customers  select start from customers, where  last name should end with either ey or  om. So, in the search pattern we type out  ey followed by a dollar sign to indicate the end of a string then we add a vertical bar to supply the second search pattern. So On and once again dollar sign.  Let's execute this query, oops I forgot to type out regular expression, there you go. So,  Let's execute this query, and you should get  these four customers with ID's one  three, five and seven. The first three, five, and seven, the first three, their last names  end with ey, and the last customer, his or her last  name ends with on. Alright, Now, let's  work on the third exercise. So I'm just going to change the regular expression  here, we want to get the customers whose last names start with my or contains se. So we use  a carrot to indicate the beginning of a string so  it should start with my, or it should contain se,  again, very easy, let's execute this query  and we get the customer's with ID's  4, 8, and 10 and finally  we want to get the customers who's last names contain e  so, let's change the search pattern, we should have a b,  followed by r or u. Now there are two ways to write  this regular expression, we can use square brackets so  we have b followed by r or u, that's one way, or the other way is to use a vertical bar. So b r or bu. These are both valid solutions. So, I hope you knocked out these exercises, in the next tutorial I'm going to show you  how to get the records with missing values.  In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to look for records that miss  an attribute. For example, if you select all the customers in our database,  you can see that the customer with id 5 doesn't have  a full number. So if you look closely here, you can see the value of null. Null means the absence of a value. Now let's say we want to search for all the customers who don't have a phone. Perhaps you want to send them an email and say hey, your phone is missing in our system. So how can we get these customers? That is very easy? We use the is null operator, so in the where clause, we type out  where phone is null. Now let's execute  this query, we only get one customer who doesn't have a phone,  now here we can also use the not operator to get  the customers who do have a phone. So we change the conditions to is not null. Let's execute the query,  now in the query results, every customer  does have a phone number.  For this exercise, I want you to write a query  to get the orders that are not shipped yet. This is a very useful query  that is used in a  lot of real applications. For example, let's say you're an admin for online shop. You want to see the orders that are not shipped yet, so you can see  them all. So write a query, and get these orders.  So here we have the orders table, let's have a quick look at the data in this table. So if you pay close attention  you see some of these orders don't have a date. And these orders also don't have a shipper id which  is a unique number for identifying the shippers. So any order that misses the value for the ship date or shipper ID,  is considered an order that is not shipped. So let's go ahead and write  a query to get these orders. So back to our query editor  select star from orders where  ship_date is  null. You could also write shipper id is null. They're both equally correct. So let's execute this query, and you should get  5 orders. Orders 1, 3, 4, 6,  and 8.  In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to sort data in your sequel queries. So here in your have a query to select all the customers from the customers table, if you look at  the query result, you can see that our customer's or sorted by id,  so we have customers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. This is the  default sort column. But we can always change this using the  order by clause. But first, let me explain  why the customer id column is the default sort column. So first of all the first I'm going to open up the navigators panel on the left side here's the customers table, now let's click on this middle icon here that looks like  tool. This opens up our customers table in the design mode,  here we can change our columns we cana dd new column or  remove existing ones or change that name and order and so on.  Now if you pay close attention you can see a yellow key just before  This means that this column is the primary key column.  For this query. So in relational databases every table should have a primary key column, and the values in that column  should uniquely identify the records in that table. So  back to our query window, you can see that the values in this column  uniquely identify each customer, so the customer id column  is the primary key column in this table, and that is why when you write a  query against this table, our customers will sort it by id by default.  Now, let me show you how to sort customers by a different column.  So, here in the order by clause, you type out the name of another column, like first name. Let's execute the query, now we can  see our customers are no longer sorted by their id, instead  they are sorted by their first name in ascending order. Now,  if you want to reverse the sort order, simply type out de,  e, sc, which is short for descending. Now,  you're sorting the customers in this order, okay,  we can also sort data by multiple columns, for example,  let's say first we want to sort customers based on their state,  and then within each state, we want to sort them by their first name.  So, we type out multiple columns here, state  and first name. Let's execute the query  now, you can see that the first state we have here is california, followed  by Colorado, and new here in Florida, you have two customers  and these customers are sorted by their first name. Let's have a  close look here, so first we have Ambur and then we have other customers here. Now we can also use the descending argument anywhere here.  For example, we can sort these customers by their state in descending  order. And then sort them by their first name in ascending order  or once, again in descending order. So there are various ways we can sort data. Now one of the differences between MySQL, and  other database management systems, is that in MySQL you can sort data by any columns whether that column is in the select clause  or not. For example, let's say you only want to select  the first and last name for each customer. Now we can sort the result by any columns in this table, they don't have to be first name and last names For example, we can sort them by their birthdate,  take a look, so this is a valid query in MySQL, but other databases management sometimes yell at you when you update a query like this.  Now we can also sort data by an alias for example, here in out select clause let's add the number ten and give it a  alias. As let's say points, so points is not a valid column in this table, it's simply an alias  or expression, in this case a simple number. And here we could have a complex  mathematical expression, it doesn't really matter, we can still sort  data by Alias, so we can order by points  and then first name. Once again this is a valid,  query from MySQL's point of view. Now one last thing before we finish  this tutorial, I've seen some tutorials that teach you how to sort data by calling positions, for example, here we can order it by  1, 2, and that basically means sort the data by the first name,  and then, the last name. So these are the orders of these columns,  if you execute this query, you can see that our customers are sorted by their first  name and then last name. Why this approach works, it's something that you should avoid. Because if in the future you come back here and add  a new column, in front of the first name column, let's say  first, date. Now our customers are no longer sorted  in this order. So sorting data by calling positions  produces unexpected results and is something you should avoid.  always sort by column names like first,  Alright, here's your exercise for this tutorial. In this database, we have this table,  called order items, where we find the items for each order. Now,  I've written the query that you cannot see here, because that's the solution to the exercise  I'm going to give you, that query produces this results. So  we only have the items for the order with ID 2, and we  have sorted these items based on the total price  for each item. So the total price for each item equals quantity times unit price. In this case the total price of product 1 is just  over 18 dollars. So go ahead and write a query  to select all the items for order with ID2. And  sort them by their total price in descending order.  Alright, let's select everything from order  items, where order id equals 2.  that returns all the items for this order. Now we want to make sure  to sort them by their total price, so,  here in order by clause, we write an expression. Quantity times  unit price, this returns the total price for each item.  And then we add the descending argument here. So,  once again the expression that we use in the order by clause doesn't have to be  column name, it can be an alias or an arithmetic expression like this.  Let's go ahead and execute this query. This is what we get  now for clarity, I would like to add another column in the result  So, let's say quantity times unit _price. We give it an alias like total  price. Let's execute the query, you can clearly  see, that this data ia sorted by the total rice in descending order.  However, there is a bit of duplication in our query, you have to repeated this expression in two places. So now we can simplify our  by clause, by using an alias that is total price.  And we gwet the exact same result. Net I'm going to show you how to mimic the number of records returned form your queries.  In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to limit the  records returned from the query. For example, when we return this query  we get all the customers in the customer, table, so we have to  ten customers here. Now what if we only want to get,  the first 3 customers. That's where we use the limit clause.  Let me show you. So, after from, you type out limit 3, and this will return only the first 3  customers. Now if the argument that we pass here is greater than the number of records that our query produces, we'll get  the records in the query result. For example, if I pass 300 here,  obviously we don't have 300 customers in this table, so when we execute this query. We get all the ten customers in this table.  So this is how the limit clause works.  Now here we can optionally supply an offset, and this is very  useful in situations where you want to paginate the data. For example,  let's say we have a website, and on this website we have a web page for the user to see all the customers int he database. Now for simplicity  let's imagine, we want to show only there customers per page. So,  what are the customer's you're going to have on page 1? We're going to have  customers 123. On page 2 we're going to have customers 456 and on page 3 we're going to have customers 789.  Now, let's say we want to write a query to retrieve the customers on page 3.  How can we do that? Well, you want to skip the first  6 records and then pick 3 records. So,  we change our limit clause to something like this. 6 and 3. So 6 is what we call an offset.  And that basically tells MySQL to skip the first records  and then take 3 records. Let's execute this query. Alright, now we get  customers 789.  Now, for your  exercise, I want you to get the top 3 loyal customers. These are the customers that have more points then everyone else.  Alright, first we select everything from the customers table,  now we need to order these customers by their points,  in descending order. So if you look at the query result  you can see that customers are sorted by their loyalty. So,  the most loyal customers come first, now we want to pick  only the first three customers, and that's where  we sue the limit clause, so limit,  let's execute this query. And these are the  most loyal customers, customers with id's 56 and 3. Now, here's one thing I want you to remember and that is  the order of the limit clause. The limit clause should always  come at the end. So first we have the select clause and then we have from optionally you can have where followed by order by and finally limit. Order of these clauses matter  If you change the order MySQL is going to yell at you. So pay attention to the order when writing your queries.  So far you have only selected columns from a single but in a real  world, we quite often select columns from multiple tables. And that's what I'm going to show you over the next few tutorials, so on the left side if you put  our orders table. Let's select all the data here,  in this table we're using the customer id column to identify the customer  that has placed each order. Now as I have told you before  we don't store customers information here like their phone number, their email their address,  because this information can change in the future. And if  even a customer has placed multiple orders then we have to change multiple records, you don't want to do that. That's why we have separate tables  for customers and orders. Now in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to select the orders in the orders table, but instead of showing the customer id, we showed full name for each customer. So lets go back to our query window. Okay, so,  we want to select everything from the orders table. Now we should combine the  columns in this table with he columns in the customers table. That  is where we use the join keyword. And here we can optionally  type inner join, because we in SQL we have two types of join inner join and over join. You'll look at outer joins later in this section,  so for now we are only using inner join and these inner keyword,  is actually optional, so we don't have to type it. So, you want to join the orders table with the customer table. Now, on what basis do we want to join these tables?  Well, here in the customers table, we have this customer id column.  So if you put these two tables next to each other you want to line up the records  such that the customer ID's are equal. That is where  we use the on phrase. So after we type out a condition, here's a condition we need to type out,  orders.customer_id. Should be equal to  customers.customer id.  Now, this is getting outside of the screen, so let's break up the line,  that's better, so with this query, we're telling MySQl that hey, whenever you're going the orders table  with the customers table, make sure that the customer ID column,  in the orders table, equals the customer ID  column, in the customers table. Now let's execute this query,  look at the result,  since we are selecting everything here, the first few columns are from the orders table, because we have listed that first  now after all the columns in the  customer table. So customer ID first name, last name and so on.  Now let's simplify the result set and select only  border id, first name, and last name, so query  we select order ID, first  name, and last name. Now let's execute the query  that is better. So next to each order ID, you can see the  name of the customer that placed that order. Now what if you want to display  the customer ID here as well. Well, let's put that here and  see what happens. Customer ID, execute the query  we get an error, so if you look at the output window, down at the bottom,  we should see an error saying column, customer id, field this is ambiguous. Now unfortunately I cannot show you this error, because the size of my recording window is smaller then MySQL workbench. But that aside, let me explain why we're getting this error. Because we have this customer ID  column in both the orders and the customers table,  so MySQL is not sure which table we want to select this column from. That is why it's saying this column is ambiguous  so we need to qualify this column by prefixing it with a table name.  We can either pick it from order table or  the customers table, it doesn't really matter, because the values are equal, right? So, in situations where you have  the same column in multiple tables, you need to qualify them,  by prefixing them with the name of the table, okay, now,  we say tot he query one more time, there you go, you have order ID,  customer ID and the full name. Now one more thing  before we finish this tutorial, if you pay close attention we have repeated the word  orders in multipel places, you have it here, as well as  in the join condition, the same is true about he customers table, you have repeated that here. We can get rid of this repetition  and make our code simpler by using an alias. So write  after each table you can do it in alias,  as a short for orders, so by convention we abbreviate the table's name.  Now, wherever we have orders you should replace that with  o. So here in the join condition, we're going to replace orders  with o, and also one more time, in the select  clause. There you go. You can also apply an alias for  a customer's table, call it c, and then simplify  our join condition like this. So this is how we can join  columns for multiple tables.  Now for your  exercise, I want you to look at the order items table.  So, in this table we have these columns, order ID, column ID,  product id, quantity, and unit price. Now I want you to write a query  and join this table with the products table so for each order  return both the product id as well as this name, followed by the  quantity, and the unit price form the order items table. And by the way  make sure to use an alias to simplify your code,  Alright, first let's select everything from the order  items table, and then join it with the  products table. How are we going to join this table. On order_items. Well actually  let's just keep this on Alias right away, so we use oi,  as an abbreviation for order items. And p as  a short for products. So oi.product id, should be equal to p or products. product id. And by the way, remember that alias for table, you have to use that alias everywhere. So here I cannot type out product, MySQL is going to yell at me. So let's use the abbreviation. Alright, this is how we join these tables,  let's execute this query up to this point. Alright,  so we see all the items form the order items table, followed by  from the products table. Now, you want  to explicit select a few column here. So, to  order items table you want to select order_id.  We take it then we don't have to prefix it with a table name  because this calumnies not repeated in multiple places, so it's not ambiguous.  So, let's make the code shorter, that's better, now  we want to select the product ID column, but because this column exists in both tables, you have to both prefix it with a column name. Either oi or p it doesn't really matter. So,  next, we want to select quantity, and finally you want  price. Now actually here, you have this unit price column.  In both tables, so this is the unit price in order items table  and this is the unit price in the products table,  now you might be curious why we have this column in 2 places,  is that the price of product can change, so for each  order item, you want to have the price at the time the user  placed the order. So this is a snapshot of the price  at a given point in time. The unit price that we have for the products table  is the current price right now. This is very important for the  recording, otherwise we cannot calculate the sales properly. So,  because we have the unit price column in two places, in this case we should pick it from the quarter items table because this is the price at the time of now, let's execute query. So here's  the final result.  In the real world, when you work as a developer or a data base administrator quite often you will  have to work with multiple databases. In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to combine columns from tables in multiple places.  That's pretty easy. So, in the SQL store database, you have this tables  that you're fairly familiar with. Now imagine this products table was not here. Now, if you look at the  database, you can see here another products table, this products table is exactly the same as the products table that we have  in a SQL store database, so it has the same columns and the same data.  Now technically this is not a good design, you don't want to have the same table  repeated in multiple places. But for this demo, let's just imagine  that we don't have the products table here, so we want to join the  order items table, with the products table in the SQL inventory database. Let's get started. So select  everything from the order items table,  let's give it an alias straight away, you want to join this with the products table. This products table is part of the products inventory  database. So we'll have to prefix this with the name of it's database.  So, we type out SQL inventory. Now once again we can give this an alias like p,  then type out our joint condition, so oi.product  id should be the same as p.product id.  Let's run the query there you go, so we successfully joined  tables across multiple databases. Now note that we're prefixing the products table with the name of the database because  the current database that we're writing this query with is the SQL stored  database. Take a look, in the navigator panel, in the SQL  store database is displayed in full. Because earlier, the  root we use statement to select  a database, that will SQL store. Now what if we select  the SQL inventory database. So, let's see what happens SQL  inventory, now because we have multiple statements we have  to terminate this with a semi colon. Now we want to select everything with a  order items table. But we don't have this table inside of this  database. So now we'll have to prefix this table  with the name of it's database, that is SQL underline  story. Let's execute the query, okay,  everything works, beautifully. So here's the lesson. You only have to  prefix the tables that are not part of the current database. In other words the query will be different depending on the database.  In SQL we can also join a table with itself. Let me show you an example. Take a look at this database.  SQL hr, in this database we have  these two tables, employees and offices. Let's take a look at the  data int he employees table.  There you go. So here we have these columns,  employee id, first name, last name, salary  and reports 2. This is the id of  the manager for this person or this employee. Now once again,  you don't want to repeat the managers information here, like the phone number, the address because this information can change in the future, so we are only using  your identifier or their id to refer to them in this table,  now where can we find information about this This manager is actually an employee of the same organization, so,  look at this example, the manager ID is 37 370. Now if you look on the website, here is the ID of that manager which is another employee. That was the manager for this employee. We don't have any values here so  the value for the sale is null. So this employee doesn't have a manager  and that means they are the CEO. So let's go ahead and  write a query to join this table with itself so we can select the name of each employee and their manager. Back to our query window,  first we need to select the SQL hr database.  Next, we select everything from  the employees table, we give an alias like b now we need to join this table with itself. So once again we type  out the employees, but we need a different alias. What should we  call this alias. Well you want to join this table with itself so we can  find the managers right? So we can use m as a shortcut  for managers. Now, let's type our our joint condition.  So from the employees table, we need to join  the reports_2 column. To the manager  table which is basically an employees table itself, and  that is employee_ id. Now let's execute this query and see what we get.  So, we see all the columns from the employees table  repeated the first set of columns, represent the information about the  employees, and after that, we have the information about the managers in this case we have only one manager in this table.  But with this technique we can easily create an organization trial. We can have  a hierarchy of managers. Now let's  only the name of the employee and the manager. So,  right here, since every column in the employees table is  repeated twice we need to prefix each column with a table name.  For example, from the employee's table you want to get employee ID, as well as the first  name, and then for the managers table, we want to select  the first name as well. So every column  should be prefixed with a table name or more accurately the alias because all these columns exist in two tables, right?  Let's go ahead and execute this query, so,  this is what we get, employee id, and here's the managers  first name. We can improve this query by giving an alias to this column. Because it doesn't make sense to have two first name columns.  So, let's give an alias to the third column,  manager. Now, let's execute it one more time.  And, here's the end result. So, we have the empty ID first name, and object. So,  joining a table with itself is pretty much the same as joining a table with another table. The only difference is that we have to use  different alias's. And we have to prefix each column with an alias.  This is what we call a self join. Next, I'm going to show you how to join more then two tables.  In this tutorial,  I'm going to show you how to join more then two tables in writing a  query. For example, back to our SQL database, look at the  orders table, now you know how to write a query to join this table with the customers table to return information about the customer to place each order. But here we also have another column,  status, which is similar to the customer ID status. So the name of the  status's are not stored in this table, they are somewhere else in the  order status's table. Let's have a quick look here.  Our orders can be either processed, shipped or delivered. And these are the identifiers for each of these status's. Now back to our orders table. In the status column you store status id. So now we should write a query to join the orders table, be two tables. The customers table and orders  status's table. The result of this query is going to look like this.  So for each order we see the order id, the date,  the first and last name of the customer, and finally the status of the order.  This is a beautiful report we can create for our users. So let me show you how to write this query. Back to our query editor, first we need to select  the SQL store database, now, we need to select  everything from the orders table, that's going to be the alias,  next we need to join this with the customers table.  On, that customer id should  be equal to see the customer id. Nothing  new so far. Exactly like before. Now here we can write another joint keyword. To join the others keyword  order status's table. So we type out order status's.  And also give it an alias, OS,  what is our join condition? Well, back in the  orders table, here we have the status column. So the  value in this column should be equal to the order status ID,  column in order status's table. Right? So back to the query, so orders table.status should be equal to order status's.order status ID. Make sure to get the name right, otherwise you're going to get an error So this is how we can join three tables.  Now in the real world as you work on more complex problems, you'll end up joining  even ten tables. So this is not uncommon in the SQL world.  Now let's go ahead and execute this query. First we get the column  from the orders table, followed by the orders from the customers table,  and so on. This result is so complex and hard to extract information.  from. So, let's explicitly select  a few columns here. From the orders table, you want to select  the order iD column, as well as the order date. Then, from the customers table, we want to select  the first name, and last name. And finally form the order status's, we select the name  column. So we can give this an alias like status that's better. Let's execute the query one more time.  So, here's the end result, we have order ID,  order date, the name of the customer, followed by the status of the order.  Alright, for exercise, take a look at the SQL invoicing database. Here we have this table, payments,  and these are the payments that each client has made towards either invoice  Let's take a look at the data, so we have these columns,  like client id, that identifies the client, so we can join this table  with the client's table to see the name of the clients. Next we  have invoice ID, we also have date,  payment method. So similarly we can join this table with the payment method  table here, let's have a look at the data in this table, these are the  payment methods, credit card, cash, PayPal, wire transfer. So,  back to the payments table, I want you to write a query and join this table  with the payment methods table as well as the client's table.  Produce a report that shows the payments, with more details, such as the name of the client,  and the payment method.  Alright, first we need to use, the SQL invoicing database, now we can  select everything from the payments table which we call e, next we need to join this with the client's table which we call c, on p.clientid  should eb equal to c.client id. Let me double  check the column name to make sure I got it right, so back to the payments table the column is called client item. You also have a column called  payment method, that we should join to the payment  method ID column of the payment methods table.  So, back to the query, once again we use a joint  statement here, join with payment methods, we give it an alias  pm, on p. payment _method should be equal to pm.  payment method id. Make sure to type it out correctly  otherwise you're going to get an error. So let's go ahead and execute the query  up to this point, finally let's hand pick  the columns that make the most sense. So,  from the payments table, let's select the date, followed by invoice id,  what else do we have here. So we have client id, invoice  id, date, and now the payment method, I'm going to pick the amount  column from here as well, so back to the query, p  .amount. Now we need to add information about the client.  Let's take a look at this table, clients,  so here we have columns like name, address,  city and so on. All we need here is the name column. So back to the query,  of the client's table let's select the name column and  finally form the payment method table, let's select, what is that column called it's called name. So back to the query pm.name. So here's the end result.  Now we can put this column in any order that we want, it doesn't really matter,  let's execute the query, and make sure everything works.  So, on this date, on this invoice,  we have a payment for this amount by this client using a  credit card.  Ina let he examples you have seen so far,  we use a single column to uniquely identify the rows  in a given table. For example, for example, in the customers table,  we have this customer ID column which uniquely identifies  the rows in this table. But there are times where we cannot use a single  column to uniquely identify columns in a given table. For example, look at the order items table. In this table, we have columns like order id, product id, and so on. Now if you look at  the data, you can see that the values in the order id column are repeated.  They are duplicated. You have 2226 and so on. So we cannot use this column on it's own to uniquely identify each record.  The same is true for the product id. The values for this column  are also duplicated. So in this table we use the combination of the values in both these columns to uniquely identify  each oder item. As an example, in this order we have  3 items, for products, 1, 4, and 6, and  for each product, we have a quantity and unit price. So if we use the combination of the values in both these values,  we can uniquely identify each order item, in other words, we don't have  two records for order ID 2, and product ID 1,  we only have a single record for that item,  now let's open this table in the design mode. So over here we  find this middle icon that looks like a tool. Note that this yellow  key that represents the primary key exists on both these columns.  This is what we call a composite primary key. The composite primary key  contains more then one column. Now why does this matter?  Well, when you have a table with a composite primary key.  You need to learn how to join that table with other tables. For example,  here we have this table, order item notes, that we use to keep notes in each order item. Let's look at the data here.  So we have this column note id, right? Which uniquely identifies the  records in this table, next to that we have order ID and product ID.  you learn that the combination of these two columns uniquely represents  and order ID. So here for order number 2,  for product number 1, we have two notes. Now let me show you how join this table with the order items table. So, back to our  query, you can see that I have already selected the SQL store database, so I'm not going to type out a U statement. Alright, let's select  like everything from the order  items table. Give it an alias, now we need to join this with order item notes, also  we give it an alias. How are we going to join these tables?  Based on two columns, back to the order items table  these are the columns that we need to use in our joint condition.  So, in the order items table we have this  order ID column, these should be equal to the same column in order item notes table. So,  in.order id. But this is not enough,  we should also join these tables based on the product ID number.  So, we type out and, and then type out the  second condition, so order items. product ID should be equal to order item notes.product  id. This is what we call a compound joint  condition. So we have multiple conditions to join these two tables.  In this tutorial  I'm going to talk about the implicit joint syntax in MySQL.  So here we have a basic inner join, we're selecting everything from the orders table,  joining it with customers table on, orders.customer id. Equal to customers.customerid. Pretty basic.  There is another way to write this query using implicit join  syntax. Let me show you how this works. So,  we select everything  from now here we can type out multiple table names.  so, orders, customers.  And we can also give them an alias, so c and  o. And then we move this join condition,  to the where clause, so I'm going to copy this from here,  type out the where clause, and paste the condition. These two queries,  are equivalent. What we have here is called implicit  joint syntax. Now even though MySQL supports the syntax  it's something that I suggest you not to use, because if you accidentally forget  to type out the where clause, you will get a cross join. Let me show you what I mean. So first I'm going to delete the first query.  And execute this  so we get ten records because we have  10 orders in this database. So far so good. What happens if you accidentally type out the where clause. Instead of 10 records we're going to get  probably 100 records. Because every record in the order table, is now joined with every record in the  customers table. This is what we call a cross turn. Now later in this section I'm going to talk about cross joins in more detail, but what I want to talk about  in this tutorial, is that it's better to use an explicit  joint syntax, so, we use, join  because this syntax forces you to type out the joint condition, if  you simply join orders with customers, without typing  the join condition, you're going to get a syntax error. So to recap,  be aware of the implicit join syntax, but write all of  your joints using the explicit syntax.  Earlier in this section I told you that in SQL we have two types of forms.  Inner joins and outer joins. And so far you have  only seen examples of inner joins. And I also told you that this inner keyword is  optional, so whenever you type out a join, you're using an inner join.  In this tutorial, we're going to look at outer joins and the problems they solve. So, let's start by writing a query that uses an  inner join, and then we'll convert hat inner join and outer join.  So, select everything from the customers table  join it in the orders table,  on c.customer id should be equal to  o.customer ID. Pretty basic  right? Now for clarity, let's pick a few columns from these two tables .So for the customers table I want to pick customer  id. And first name,  and from the orders table, I want to pick order id.  Now finally, let's sort the results so we can clearly see what  we get. So order by c.customer  id. Let's execute that query and see what we get.  So, here' the result. For customer number 2 called  inis or inis whatever, you have 2 orders, order 4,  and order 7. Similarly for customer number 5, we have  2 orders and so on. Now there is something missing in this result.  We only see customers who have an order in our system, these are  customers 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. But if you look at the customers table, you can see that  you have other customers like customer number 10, customers number 3, and so on.  Currently we don't have any orders for these customers, and that's the reason  we don't see them in this results set. But what if you want to see all the  customers whether they have an order or not? That's when we use an  outer join. Let me show you how that works. So back to our query  the reason we only saw customers who have an order was because  of this join condition, When joining these two tables, you are only  returning records that match his condition. So for a given customer, if we do have an order, that record is returned. But as you saw a second ago, some customers don't have  an order. So for those customers this condition is not  valid. And that is the reason they are not returned in the result set.  To solve this problem we use an outer join. Now in SQL we  have two types of outer joins. We have left joins and right  joins. When we use a left join,  all the records from the left table, in this case customers are  returned whether this condition is true or not. So we  get all the customers, and if they do have an order, we'll see the order id  as well. Let's execute this query and see what we get. So,  there you go. Customer number 1,  doesn't have an order and that's why we get null in this cell.  Customer number 2 has two orders, 4, and 7, customer  number 3 also doesn't have an order so we get null for order id.  This is the result of a left join. So back to our query  when we use a left join, all the records from the left  table are returned whether this condition is true or not.  Now what if we use a right join. In this  case, all the records from the orders table are returned whether this condition is  true or not. Let's execute this query and see what we get.  So, we get he same result as before.  when we use an inner join, because we are selecting all the records from the right table  which is the orders table, so we don't see all the customers  we see all the orders. Now if you want to use a right join, and  still see all the customers, you need to swap the order of these tables. So,  we put the orders table first that's going to be our left table.  And then, we put the customers on the right side,  so now with this query we'll return all the records from the right table  which is the customers table. We execute this we get  all the customers whether they have an order or not.  Beautiful. Now one last thing before we finish this tutorial,  I've seen developers use the outer keyword here. So either  right outer join or left outer join. But technically  the outer keyword is optional just like the inner keyword, so you don't have to type it out.  So I'm going to remove this to make this code shorter and easier to  understand. So to recap, if you have the join keyword directly, and  if you do a left or right join you're doing a  inner outer join.  Here's your exercise for this tutorial. I want you to write a query that produces this result. So we should have three columns here. Product  ID, name, and quantity that I picked from the  order items table, so here we need to join the products table.  With order items table. So we can see how many times each product is ordered.  However, in an inner join we will only see the products that  have an order, but here I'm doing an outer join, so,  product number 7, has never been ordered, but still exists in the result.  Is it null, or the quantity? So go ahead and write an outer  join, or use this result.  Alright, first we select  everything from the products table and then  to a left join with the order items table.  Our join condition is p.product  id equals oi.product id.  So because we'll get all the products  in the products table whether this condition is true or not. If you have never  been ordered, you still see them in the result. Now, let's  pick a few columns for clarity. So p.productid  p.name and oi. quantity. That's it. Let's execute the query. We get the same result as before. So all the products are here.  And product number 7 has never been ordered so we see  null for the quantity.  Similar  to inner joins, we can use outer joins between multiple tables. Let me show you. So here's the query that we wrote in the last tutorial, you are doing a  left join between customers and orders tables.  So when we execute this query, you get all the customer  whether they have an order or not. If you have an order you see the order id. Beautiful. Now if you look at the orders table, you can see that some of our orders have a shipper id. These are the orders that have been shipped. So now let's join  orders table with the shippers table to display the name of the shipper in the result.  So back to our query, after this left join,  let's write another join, here I'm doing an inner join.  So let's inner join the orders table with the shippers table.  Join shippers, we call it sh, on  what is the join condition. Well, oh.shipper  id, should be equal to sh.shipper  id. Alright? So in this query we have  a left outer join and inner join. Let's see  what we get, alright, we only  see 5 records. But you have more orders. So here you have the same problem  we have before. Some of our orders don't have a shipper, and that is why  they are not returned here. In other words, this join condition is not true, for some of our orders. So back to the orders table,  a an example, this first order doesn't have a shipper shipper id is null, and that is why it is not returned with a query result.  So to solve this problem, you should use a left join, you want to make sure that all orders are returned whether they have a shipper or not.  So back to the query, you need to replace this inner join  with the left join, so let's execute the query and see what happens.  Now we should have quite a few more orders, there you go, now to make this example more interesting, I'm going to add the ship -per name here. So back to our select boss, let's add a new column, shipper.name.  Now we can give it an alias like shipper let's execute the query and here's the result. So we get all the customers whether they have an order or  not. And for those who do have an order, we get all the orders whether we have a shipper or not. This is the power of outer joins. Now in the last tutorial, you learned that you can get the same result, in both the left join or the right join, you just have to swap the order of the tables. However, as a best practice of what to avoid using right joins, because when you're joining multiple tables and you have  left and right and inner join, things get really complex. So,  someone else reading your code, will have difficulty visualizing how you're joining these tables.  As an example, if you have a right join here and then a left join  after, it will be harder to visualize how these tables are getting joined.  So, as a best practice, avoid right joins, and use left joins  instead.  And, here is your exercise for this tutorial.  I want you to write a query that produces this result. So here you have these columns  order date, order id, the first name of the customer the shipper and we can see that some of our orders are not shipped yet.  So here we have null, and here finally, we have the status.  So go ahead, spend 2-3 minutes on this exercise, when you're done continue  watching.  Alright, let's select everything  from the orders table, now you should join this with customers, on, hold.customerid.  Should be equal to c.customer id. Here I'm using an inner join, because every order does have a customer. So,  this condition is always valid, it doesn't matter if we use a left join or a  inner join here, now, okay? Now before going any further let's  take our columns. So from the orders table, I'm going to pick order id.  Followed by order date. And then,  customer.firstname.  Which we can optionally rename to customer.  Alright, next we need to select the shipper. So, we join the result with the shippers table,  on order.shipperid equal  to shipper.shipperid. However, if we use an inner join here, because some of our orders don't have a shipper, we are only  going to see the orders that have been shipped. Let me show you. So,  for clarity, I'm going to add the shippers name here, so shipper .name as shipper. Let's execute the query  there you go, we only see the orders that have been shipped.  But we want to see all the orders, right? So, we need to  change the second joint to a left join.  So all orders are returned whether they have a shipper or not.  Let's execute the query one more time,  there you go. Now we see all the orders from number 1-10.  Beautiful. Finally, we need to add the status comment here.  So, we need to do another join here, join with order status's, which we aggregate  as os, on oh.status equals  to os.orderstatusid.  We can see that I have designed our database such that sometimes our column names  are exactly identical, but in other cases they don't match.  So in order table we call this column, status, as opposed to  order status id, and this is deliberate because a lot of  real databases are like that. Alright, now let's add the status name here, so order, status.name as status. Execute the query,  and we can see all the orders here,  for each order we have the data, the customer, the supper and the status.  Earlier, we talked about self joins in SQL. So here in the SQLhr database, we have this employees table, we rote a query to get  all the employees and their manager. So here we have this column, reports  to that specifies the manager for each employee. So let's go back and rewrite this query to get all the employees and their manager.  Back to our query editor window, first let's use a SQL hr database. Then select everything  from the employees table, we give it an alias and then join it with itself.  So this is what we call a self join. Now we're going to use a different alias  like m for managers. Now, what is the joint condition e.reports to, should be equal to  m.employee ID, right?  Now for clarity, let's pick only three columns, so either the id  employee.first name.  And m.firstname which we rename to  manager. Alright, let's execute this query and see what we get.  So, here's the result  as you can see all these employees have the same manager.  However, there is something missing here. We don't have a record for this person, this  manager himself. So what is missing is a record where  we can see the employee id for this person, their name and their  manager which should be null because this person is the CEO or the  head of the company. But why is this happening? The reason is,  our inner join, because this condition we have here will only  return people who have manager. We can solve this problem by using a  left join. So, we do a left join, because we want to get every employee in this table whether they have a manager or not.  Okay, now let's execute the query one more time.  There you go. Now we have a record for this person  the manager, as you can see this person does not have a manger, that's why we have null here.  Back to our SQL store database  here we have a simple query that joins the orders table,  with a customers table. And here's our join condition. We have several examples  of this before. Now as our queries get more complex  these joint conditions get in the way, they make our queries hard to read, but the good news  is that in MySQL, we have a powerful feature for simplifying  these queries. If the column name is exactly the same  across these two tables, we can replace the on clause.  With a using clause which is simpler and shorter.  So I'm going to comment out this line and instead type out using  in parenthesis, we type out the column name, that is custom.  customer id. What we have in line 7 is exactly identical to what we have  on line 6. That is shorter and easier to read. So,  let me delete this line. We can add another join statement here to join the orders for the shippers here, so join with  shippers using  shipper id. In both these tables we have a column with the exact  same name. Alright, now let's execute this query  this is what we get, you have the order id followed by the  first name of the customer. Let's add a new column here,  so, I'm going to add sh  .name that is the name of the shipper,  now obviously because some of our orders are not shipped, we have to replace this  inner join to the left join. So we can use the using keyword with both inner and outer joins. Let's execute  the query one more time. There you go.  Now, we have the name of the shipper next to each order, beautiful,  however, we cannot use this technique to join the result with the  order status's table. Because in the orders table we have  this column called status, but in order status's table, this column has a different  name. It's order status id. Let me show you. So,  order status's. columns, there you go, order status id.  So the using keyword only works if the column name is  exactly the same across different tables. Now what if we have multiple  columns in our join condition. For example, earlier we talked about  tis order items table, I told you that in this table we have  a composite primary key, which basically means a primary key that consists  of multiple columns. So the combination of these two columns uniquely  identifies each record in this table. Now if I join this table,  with order item notes table. In our join  join condition, we should compare both these columns with their corresponding  columns in the order item notes table. So let's quickly  write that query and then simplify it with the using keyword.  So, select everything from  order items, now, join it with order  item notes on  so here we need to compare oi.order  id with yn.orderid, and  oi.productid= to oin.productid. This join  condition is kind of messy, it's hard to read this query. Now let's simplify this query with the using keyword. So we type out using. In parenthesis  we add both columns and then separate them using a comma.  So, ordered and product  id. Isn't that better?  Now, for our exercise, back to our SQL invoicing database write a query to select the payment  from the payments table and produce something like this. So in this table we have the date  the client, the amount and the payment method, we can see.  On what date who has paid how much using what payment method.  Alright, I'm going to use the SQL invoicing database, and then select everything from the  payments table, join it with the clients table.  Using client id because in  both these tables, you have the client id table. Next we need to join this with  payment methods, however, they  column name between these two tables is different, so in the payment  table we have a column called payment method. But in payment  methods table, our column is called payment method ID. So here we  cannot use the using keyword, and we'll have to use the on clause. So on p.payment  underline method equals pm.  paymentmethodid. Now let's pick our columns.  So, payment.date client.name.  And we rename this as client, next we pick m out, and finally, the payment method,  so, let's rename that to payment_method  and execute the query, there we go, this is what we get.  The date, the client, the amount, and the payment method.  In MySQL, we also have another  simpler way, to join two tales, it's called a natural join, and it's easier to code, but it's not something to recommend, because sometimes it produces unexpected results. But let me quickly show you how it works in case you see it somewhere so at least you're familiar with it. So back to the previous example,  let's select everything from the orders table, that we should do a natural join with the customer's table.  Now with this natural join, we don't exactly specify the column name.  So the database engine will look at these two tables and it will join  them based on the common columns. The columns don't have the same  name. And that is the reason this query is shorted right.  So, for clarity, let's pick a couple of columns here, o.order  id and c. let's say first name.  Let's execute the query, there you go.  so we see all the orders and the customers replace them.  So natural joins are really easy to code but they can  be a little bit dangerous, because we're letting the database engine  guess the join, you don't have control over it. For this very reason,  natural joins can produce unexpected results, and that's why I discourage you to use them.  In this tutorial,  were going to look at cross joins in SQL. We use cross joins to mine or join every record from the first table, with every record,  in a second table. Here is an example, let's select  everything from the customers table to  now here we do a cross join with the products table.  So every record in the customers table, will be combined with  every record in the products table. And that is why we don't have  a condition here. Okay? So this is what we call a cross join  now for clarity let's pick a couple of columns like see that first name we rename it as customer and then product.name which we rename to  product. Also, let's sort the result  by customer. first name.  Now, let's execute the query, here's the result of the cross join,  so first we have amber as the customer, and here are all combinations of amber with different products.  Next we have Barbara or whatever it is, and again we have the combination of this custom  with all the products. Now in this particular example, it doesn't really make sense to use a cross join, a real example for using  cross join is where you have a table of sizes like small,  medium, large, and a table of colors, like red, blue, green whatever.  And then you want to combine all the sizes with all the  colors. That is when you use a cross join.  Wha we have here is called the explicit syntax for cross join, you also have the implicit syntax which looks like this. Instead of typing out the cross join, you type out multiple tables in the  from clause. So customers and orders.  Both these queries produce the same result. But I personally prefer to use  the explicit syntax because it's more clear.  And here's a simple exercise for you. Do a cross join between shippers and  products. First do it using the implicit syntax,  and then using the explicit syntax. It's pretty straight forward, I just want you to  get your hands dirty in the code and get used to this syntax.  Alright, first I'm going to use the explicit syntax, and then I'm going to place the syntax. So let's start by selecting everything from  2 tables, shippers and products,  now for clarity I'm going to pick two columns, shipper. name which we rename to the shipper. And product.name which we  order everything by  shipper Let's execute the query, this is what we get. So the combination of all shippers and all products beautiful,  now let's use the  explicit syntax, so we select everything from the base table,  in this case shippers and then do a cross join with products.  That produces the same exact result.  We covered everything about joins, you learned  that with joins we can combine columns with multiple tables, but  in SQL we can also combine rows with multiple tables, and this is extremely powerful. And let me show you how this works. First we have  a quick look at our orders table, and select everything from the order  table. Now if you look at the data,  we can see that the first order was placed in the current year,  2019, all the other orders were placed in previous years. Now let's say you want to create a report, get all the orders, and next to each order,  add a label. If the order is placed in the current year, the table is  going to be active, and if the order is placed in previous years, you want to label it  as archives. So, let's change our  query and change our condition here. First you want to get all the orders in the current year. So where order  date is greater than or equal to 2019,  0101. Now I just want to highlight that this is  not the ideal way to get the orders in the current year, because here we have hard  coded 2019. So if you execute this query next year, we are not  going to get the right result. But don't worry about this for now. Later in the course I will show you how to  get the orders in the current year, without hard coding a date here.  So, let's execute this query, now we get  only one order. Let's hand pick a couple of columns here.  So, order id,  and order date. And also I want to add a string,  literal here, like active. Right?  Let's execute this query, this is what we get. We get 3  columns, order id, order date, and active, and in this column,  argument we have this string value. Active. Now let's rename this column to status, alright? And execute the query, that is better,  now we want to write another query similar to this that will return the order  in the previous year, but with a different label, archive.  So, to save time, I'm going to copy this few lines and paste them right after our first select statement. Now note that here we have a syntax error, because we didn't  terminate the first select statement with a semi colon, but don't worry about it, we're going to get back to this in a second so for the second  query, we want to return a different a different label, archive, and we want  to change our condition to less then  2019. Now, select only these few lines.  And execute this query, either by clicking on this icon here,  or using the keyword shortcut you learned earlier in the course.  There you go, here are all the  orders from the previous year, with the label archive.  This query returns 9 records. The previous query returned 1 record.  now using the union operator we can combine data from these two queries, so, in between  our select statement we type out union  now let's execute the query one more time, so here's our first  order in the current year that is active and below that we have  the orders in the previous years. So using the union operator we can combine records for multiple queries. Now in this example, both our queries are against the same table, but we can also have queries against different  tables and then combine the result into one result set.  Let me show you another example. So I'm going to delete everything here. Let's select the first name,  from the customers table, and then we can union that with select  the name from the shippers table.  Let's execute the query's in one result set we can see all the customers and the shippers. Now as far as  I know, there is no real world care for this particular query. But what I Want to point out is that with union we can combine results from multiple  query's. These query's can be against the same table or different  tables. In your database, you can have a table like archive orders, and another table like order  and then you could combine all the archive and active orders into one  result set. Just remember, that the number of columns that the query  returns should be equal, otherwise you're going to get an error. For example,  let's select the first name and last name from customers  and then union that with the name of  shippers. When we execute this query, we get an error, because the first part  of this query returns two columns, but the second part returns one column.  So MySQL doesn't know how to combine these records.  And one last thing before we finish this tutorial. If you look at the result here,  the name of this column is based on this first query, so the first query returns first name, and that's why this column is called  first name. If you change the order of these queries,  and move this union up here, now let's run this query  as you can see our column is called name.  So whatever we have in this first query is used to determine the name of  columns. Here we can also rename the column to full name.  There you go.  Here's your exercise for this tutorial. Write a query for this report.  So here we have four columns, customer ID, points, and  title. Now as you know we don't have this column in the customers table,  so we have calculated the values of this column, based on  the points each customer had. If they have less then 2,000 points,  their type is bronze. If they have between 2,000 and  3,000 points they are silver customers, and if they have more then  3,000 points, they are gold customers. Also note that here we have sort  the result by the first name. So go ahead and spend two minutes to write this query.  Alright, first let's get the bronze customers,  so select everything from customers where  points is less then 2,000.  Now here we want to pick 3 columns, customer id,  first name, end points. And finally we  add a new column to a string literal, bronze  let's run this query and see what we get. So these are all the bronze  customers, but the name of this column in bronze, we don't want that. So, let's rename this to type. Now this is off the screen so  I'm going to break this up into multiple lines  that makers our query bigger and easier to read.  There you go, let's run the query one more time, now the column is called type.  Beautiful. Now we should do union  and repeat this query, but extract the silver customers.  So I'm going to paste this query here and then make a  couple of changes here, I'm going to replace bronze with silver,  and change the condition to between 2,000  and 3,000 let's run our query, see what we get  so, we have all the bronze customers first,  followed by all the silver customers. So the order of these records is based  on our queries. In our first query we got the bronze customers, which is why  they are listed first. But this is not what we want. You want  to order the result by the first name of our customers. So,  let's apply an order by at the end so order by first name. Now there is one more piece remaining.  You should do a union one more time and write a query to get  the gold customers. SO I'm going to select these few lines.  And paste them here.  Now let's change silver to gold,  and the condition to (?) greater then 3000.  And finally we do an imported by. Let's run the query one more time.  And here's the end result, our customers  are sorted by first name, bronze, silver and gold customers.  In this section I'm going to teach you how to insert, update, and delete data. Before we get started  let's have a closer look at our customers table. So click on  this middle icon to open this table in the design mode.  What you see here might look a little bit intimidating at first, but trust me  it's so easy, and in this tutorial, I'm going to explain exactly what we have in these columns. So on the left side, you can see the column  next to that you can see the data type for each column, so our customer id column  can only accept integer value. Integers are whole numbers like 1234 and so on. You don't have decimal points, etc.  First thing is a var chart which is short for variable  character. And in parenthesis, you can see 50, that basically  means in this column you can have a maximum  of characters now if the name of a customer is only 5 characters long the only  store those 5 characters. So even though the max  length for this column is 50, you're not going to waste the space if this customer  name is less then 50 characters. That is why here we have  4char which is short for variable. In contrast we have  another data type that is character. If you had character 50 here,  and the name of the customer was only 5 characters long, MySQL  will insert additional 45 spaces to fill this column.  So this is a waste of space. So as a best practice,  Most oft he type we use var char to store strings  or textural values. Now here on the right side we have this column  pk, which is short for primary key. So customer  id is marked as the primary key, and that is why we have this yellow key here,  so the values in this column uniquely identify each  customer. Next to that we have nn which is short for not null and that determines if this column can except null values or not.  In this case, every customer record, must have the customer id.  First name, last name, as well as these other attributes.  But birthdays and phone are optional. So in these columns we  can have null values, Now we have another calling here, ai,  which is short for auto increment and this is often used  with primary key columns, so every time we insert a new  record in this table, we let MySQL or our database engine insert  a value in this column, so essentially it gets the customer id  for the last row, and it will increment it by 1, by the time you serve a new record. So if you look at the data you can  see that currently we only have 10 customers here. So if you have a new customer here,  MySQL will sign 11 to the new customer, okay? And finally here we have another column that specifies  the default value for each column. For example, for birthday  and phone columns, the default values or null,  So if you don't supply a value MySQL will supply the null values  for these columns. Similarly we have another null value,  for the points column, so if we don't supply the points for a customer, MySQL will use 0, now we have a few other columns here which are not important  at this stage, you will learn about them later in this course. So now  you understand the attribute of each column, let's go ahead  and insert data into this table.  In this tutorial,  you're going to learn how to insert a row into a table. For that we're going to use  the insert into statement. Where are we going to  insert this row? Into the customers table, so we type out  the name of the table here followed by the values clause.  And here in parenthesis we supply the values for every  column in this table, so back to our table definition,  these are all the columns, first we need to supply a value for the customer id  column. However, in this column, the auto increment  attribute is enabled, and as I told you before, if we don't supply a value,  MySQL will generate a unique value for us.  So we can go back to our statement and either assign  an explicit value or use default to let MySQL  take care of generating this value. This is the preferred approach. Because if we use this value  an explicit value like 200 it is possible that you might have  another customer with the same id. So when you execute the statement, you're going to get an error.  Because you cannot have duplicate values in this column. Every value should be unique, so here we're going to use the default keyword to let you generate a unique value for the customer id, and after that we need to  supply a value or the first name and last name columns.  So, let's say Jon Smith.  Note that I have enclosed these values with quotes, because as I have told you,  string and for in SQL, we should always enclose string and values with quotes. Either single or double quotes, okay?  Now, what else? Back to our customer table,  after the last name you have birthdate, however,  as we can see, this column is optional because this check box is not checked. So  here we can use null or an explicit value. Null means the absence  of a value. So back t our statement, you can type out  the birthdate, like 1990 January 1st or  you can use the null keyword to leave out this value.  Now in this demo, I'm going to use a value date,  now to make this code cleaner and more readable, I'm going to break it up into  multiple lines. That's better,  now back to our table, next we have phone and phone is  also optional, because this checkboxes not checked, and null is the  default value for this column. So here we can explicitly pass  null, or use the default keyword and then put null into this  column. It's exactly the same. So, back to our  statement, you can pass null or default.  Both these keywords will have the same result. In this case I'm going to use the null  keyword. Alright, let's have one more look at our table,  next we have 4 more columns that are  required, so address, city, state, and points. And note that points  has the default value of 0, so we can either use an explicit value like  total value like 200, or use the default keyword and let MySQL generate 0. So, back to our statement, let's type out  an address, it doesn't really matter.  Followed by a city, and a state, let's say california,  and finally points, again we use explicit value  or default, so this is how we can insert a row into  a table. However, in this example, you're only  supplying values for first name, last name, birthdate and  these address fields. So you're leaving out phone number  the customer id and the points. So there's another way  to write the statement. Let me show you. So after the table name you can  optionally supply the stuff columns that you want  to insert values into. In this case first name,  last name, birthdate  and once again I'm going to break up this statement into multiple lines  So 3 more columns,  address, city, and state,  so these are the 6 columns that we're going to supply values for. With this change, we don't have to use these default  or null values, we only supply values for these columns.  So I'm going to remove default from here, and null, and finally  this last default keyword.  So, the 6 values that you supplied here are used for the 6th column.  Now with this change, you can also reorder the columns.  We don't have to list them in the same order, they were defined  in the customers table, for example you can put the last name first,  and then obviously we should also swap the order of these values,  so we can list them in any orders. Now we can execute  the statement, now if you look at the output window  down on the bottom you should see the statement followed by one rows  unfortunately I cannot resize this window to show you this message, but if you look down below you can see that one word was affected, which basically means  one record was inserted into this table. Now,  let's look at the data in the customers table  so the last row is the one that we inserted, we can see that the  MySQL automatically generated the value 11, this is the effect  of auto increment attribute. So it takes the value of the last row,  and incrememnts it by 1. So here we have the first name. Last name,  birthdate, you didn't supply a value for the phone attribute, so,  that's why we have null here, we also have address, city  state, and the default value of 0 for the points.  In this tutorial, you're going to learn how to  insert multiple rows in one go. For this we're going to use the shippers  table, let's have a quick look at the table definition  so here we have 2 columns, shipper id and name. Shipper id is  primary key, it's not nullable, and it's an auto incremented  column. So we're going to let MySQL generate values for this column. Easy.  You only need to supply a value for the name column. So back to our  query editor window, we type out insert  into shippers in parenthesis we specify the name of the column  we want to insert values into, in this case name  followed by the values clause. Here we add a pair of  parenthesis with a value like shipper one. Now insert multiple rows all you have to do is insert a comma  followed by another pair of parenthesis. So,  shipper 2, one more time, comma, shipper 3,  this is how you can insert multiple rows in 1 row,  now let's execute this statement, alright,  and then inspect the data in the shippers data.  There you go. So initially we only had 5 shippers and here are the 3 new shippers that we inserted. Note that MySQL  automatically generated the values for the shipper id column.  So we have 67 and 8.  Alright, here's your exercise for this tutorial. Write a statement to insert three rows  in the products table, it's really easy you can knock it out in a minute,  So here's our products table, we only have 4 columns,  we're going to leave out the first column because it's an auto increments  column  so we only have to supply values for name, quality, unit price.  Back to our query editor window, let's insert  into products the columns are  name, quanitty in stock, and unit  price. And the values are going to be let's say product 1,  stock is going to be 10 and the unit price is going to be 1,  .95. Now I'm going to select these values. copy, paste it, like this,  change the values accordingly, and  finally the last row for the 3  there you go, let's execute this statement, alright  and then verify the result so in the products table, now we should have 3 new records,  now the id's you see here are 15, 16, and 17.  Because before recording this video I actually inserted a few records in this table and then  deleted them. So I had product ID's 11, 12 13, and 14. And even though they're actually deleted from  this table, MySQL remembers their id's so instead of incrementing  10 x 11, it incremented 14 which is the last record  from before. And that's why you generated 15. On your computer,  the items are going to be 11, 12, 13.  So far you have only learned how to insert data into a singular table.  In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to insert data into multiple tables. Here's  a really good example, look at the orders table, what columns do we have?  We have the order id, we have the customer  id, so we know who has placed the order, we know the date of the order,  you know the status, comments, as well as shipping  information, but the actual items for this order are not in this table, they  are in the order items table. So in this table, we have 4 columns  we have the order id, so we know what order these items  for. We have the product id, so we know what product  order, in what quantity, and in what price. So an actual  order can have 1 or more order items.  This is what we call a parent child relationship. So this relationship  the orders table is the parent, and the order items table is the  child. So one row in the orders table can have 1 or more children  inside the order items table. Now in this tutorial, I'm going to show you  how to insert an order and all it's items. So you will learn  how to insert data into multiple cables. alright, back  to our query editor window. First we need to insert the order,  so insert, into, let me close  the navigator panel, we want to insert a record into the order  table, now what columns do we have here? So we have these columns but only the first four are the  and actually the first one, we don't want to worry about, because that's an auto increment column.  So we only want to supply values for customer id, order date,  and status. So back to our query, specifying those columns here, customer id, order date,  and status, now let's supply the value.  In the customer id column, we need to add a  valid customer id. So let's have a quick look at our customers  table, there you go. In this table,  we have 11 records. So these are the valid customer id's.  Now back to our query, let's use 1 for customer query  and then 2019, January the 2nd  for the order date, and one for the order status, once again  in this column, we need to insert a valid order status  id. If you don't supply a valid id, MySQL is going to get ahead of us. So we insert an order here,  the items, now back to our order items table,  in this table, we have this order id column, so here's the  as soon as we insert an order, MySQL is going to generate  an id for our new order now we need to access that id in  order to insert the items in this table. How can we do that?  Well, back to our query editor window,  in MySQL, we have a bunch of built in functions, and a function  is basically a piece of code that we use ourself. Just like a function is a feature  in your tv. Every tv comes with a bunch of functions like  power on, power off, change the volume, change the channel so on.  So MySQL and other database engines come with a  bunch of built in functions  that we can use in our programs. One of these funcitons is last insert id. We can call or  execute this function, by adding parenthesis here, and this will return the ID  that MySQL generates when we insert a new row.  So, before going any further, let's just select these,  and make sure you get the right result. Now we have a syntax error here because we didn't terminate  the first statement with a semi colon, alright, now let's execute this query,  alright, so the id of the new order is  12. Let's verify that. So back to the orders  table let's look at the data. On my machine I have  12 records here, I actually created 1 just before recording this video, so on your  machine you're going to have 11 orders.  Now back to our query window now that we know how to  get the id of the newly inserted  record, we can use that id to insert the child records.  So, we're going to write another insert statement,  insert into order items, let's have  another look at the columns in this table. So we have 4 columns  on all of them are required, so there's really no need to specify the column name  in our insert statement, you simply supply values or order id,  product id, quantity and unit price. So, here  in the values clause, we add parenthesis,  what is our order id? That is the value returned  from calling this function. So I'm going to cut this from here and  next we need to supply a valid photo id,  but let's say product 1, quantity, let's say 1.  And the unit price 2.95 dollars.  Now let's delete this select we don't really need it anymore  let's add another set of values, so once again, we're going to call last insert id, to get the id of a new order, we're going to  change the product to product number 2, and add a different price.  That's it. Now let's execute this  statement and see what we get. Alright, so,  back to our orders table, let's refresh the records here, alright  so we have a new order, order number 13,  beautiful, now let's look at the orders items table, here's the order items, let's open the table. So we should have  2 items, or order number 13. Beautiful.  So this is how you insert hierarchical data in SQL.  In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to copy data from one  table to another. For example, in our orders table, currently we have  about a dozen records. Now let's say we want to create a copy of this table  called orders archive and you want to insert every row that we have  in this table into that new table. If you have 10 orders,  we don't want to quote an insert statement with a ten set of values,  that is very time consuming, so I want to show you a powerful technique to  uniquely copy data from one table to another. First we need to create this new table, order  archive. For that we're going to use the create  table as statement. So create table  orders archive as.  Now right after that we write a select statement  to get everything from the orders table.  Now let's see what happens when we execute this query, there you go. So back in the navigator panel, we have to refresh this view by clicking on this icon over here, now we  have a new table, orders archive, let's look at the data,  so you can see all the orders are here and we have the exact same column  as the orders table. However, if you open this table in the  design mode, you cans ee that in this table, we don't have a primary key.  So the order id column is not marked as a primary key.  And also it's not marked as an auto increment column, so when we create a table using this technique MySQl will ignore these attributes,  and that means if you want to explicitly insert the record  into this new table, you have to supply a value for order id,  because this column is no longer an auto increment column.  So, using create table as statement you can quickly create  a copy of a table, now we refer to this select statement  as a sub query, so a subquery is a select statement  that is part of another SQL statement.  Now we can also use a sub query and an insert statement and that is a very powerful technique. It allows us to do really cool things. Let me show you.  So first, let's right click the orders archive table,  and click on truncate table, because we want to delete  all the data in this table. Alright, it's asking for confirmation  let's truncate the table, so now back to this table.  Let's refresh the table, we don't have any records here, alright?  Now back to our query editor, let's say you want to copy  only a subset of records from the orders table into this table,  like all the orders placed before 2019. So first let's select  everything from the orders table where  order date is less then 2019, January 1st.  So, these are all the orders, order s copy these orders into he orders archive table. So we can use this select statement as a subquery   in an insert statement, we write insert  into orders archive  now we don't need to supply the column names, because we're going to  play values for every column that we have in this query.  So, we did that, and  this is ane xample of using a select statement as a subquery  in an insert statement. Let's execute this,  alright, now back to the table, let's refresh the records  we only have the orders placed before 2019.  Alright, here's a really, really, really coo exercise  back to our SQL invoicing database. Look at the invoices table.  So in this table, we have these columns,  (?) id number, client id number which is associated or related  to the client id column, in the clients table, followed by  a few other columns, now let's say you want to create a copy of the record  in this table, and put them in a new table called invoices archive.  However in that table, instead of the client id column, we want to have the client name column, so you want to join  table with the clients table, and then use that query as a sub query in a create table statement.  Also, to mae the exercise more interesting,  I want you to copy only the invoices that do have a payment. So if  you look over here, this payment data column here, determines  if a payment has been made, towards this invoice or not. So select  only the invoices that do have a payment date, it's a really really good  exercise, spend two to three minutes on this and then come back and continue watching.  Alright, first I'm going to use the SQL invoicing data,  base, now let's select everything from the  invoices table and join it to the clients table.  here I'm going to use the using statement to simplify  my join. What column are we going to use for joining? The client id  column. Let's execute this query up to this point.  Alright, so first we see client id column  is used for joining these tables, after that we have the columns from  the invoices table like invoice id number and so on. Followed by  the columns from the clients table. Name  address and so on. Obviously we don't want all these columns, we only want  the columns from the invoices table but we should replace the client id  column with he client name column. So let's have  a quick look at the design of the invoices table  here we have invoices id, number,  client id, we want to replace this column with the client name.  Back to our query, I'm going to pick,  invoice id, number  and then client.name, let's rename it to client  what other columns do we have here? We have  invoice total and payment total so let's add those as well,  invoice total as well as payment total,  we also have three columns,  for dates, invoice date, due date, and payment date,  so, let me close the navigator panel. Invoice  date payment date and  due date. Now technically because these columns only exist  in the invoices table, we don't have to prefix them with the table alias. So we can simplify the code like this, however,  I personally prefer to prefix them, because that gives me a clear  picture of how I'm joining these tables. It's just a personal preference  another developer might disagree and that's fine, so whatever you prefer. That's perfectly fine, let's execute the query and make sure  we get the right result, so we have the invoice  ID  number client beautiful, followed by these other  columns, now I want to filter the result, and return  only the invoices that do have a payment. So we can either  return records that have a payment date, or the records that have  a payment total of greater then 0. Both are perfectly  fine, so back to our query,  down at the bottom, let's add the where clause, where payment  date is not null. That's better.  Let's execute the query one more time, now we get only these  handful of invoices, beautiful, finally let's use our  query, as a subquery in a create table as statement. So right before  select we type create table, invoices,  archive, as there you go, let's execute  the query beautiful, now back to the navigator panel,  let's refresh the view, so here's our new table,  invoice and archive, let's look at the data, there you go.  You only have the invoices page and here's the name of the client for each invoice. Beautiful. Now just note that  if you execute this query one more time, you're going to get an error because we already have a  table called invoices archive. Later in the course I will show you how  to draw tables, that's pretty easy, but for now you can just right click and go to draw table and then confirm  alright, and then you can run the query one more time.  In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to update data in SQL. So back to our invoices table,  look at the first record here. The payment total for  this record is 0, and obviously there is no payment date.  Now let's imagine that there was a problem int he system that recorded this information.  Let's say the client paid ten dollars for the invoice. So we should update this record in this table. That is very easy, back ti our query editor,  window, we use the update statement to update one or more records in a table. What table? In this case invoices.  Next we add a seth clause and this is where we specify a new value  for one more or columns. In this case we want to update payment total. Let's say to ten dollars. We should also update  payment date. So here's a column to add more columns  we set this to date value, let's say  2019, March 1st, and then we type  out a condition, with this condition we identify  the record or the records that need to be updated. In this case we want to update the invoice number 1. So,  back to our query, we type out invoice id  equal to 1. Let's execute this. Beautiful,  Now back to our table, let's refresh the data by clicking on this icon.  Alright, we can see that payment total is updated to ten.  And we also have a payment date. Beautiful. Now lets say we actually  updated the wrong record, maybe we should have updated invoice  number 3, so we should update this table one more time, and restore the  original values in this column, back to our query  we can set the payment total to 0, and  the payment date to null. So we can use the null keyword to insert the null value in a column that accepts  null values. Now back to the navigator panel, let's open the  table in the design mode. We can see that the payment total column  has a default value of 0, and the payment date column  has the default value of null. So back in our query  we can also set payment total tod default and MySQL  will use the default value for this column, which is in this case 0.  So, let's execute this statement one more time, beautiful.  Now, back to the table, let's refresh the data, so payment total is set to 0. And payment date is null. Beautiful.  Now let's go ahead and update the third payment. Look at the invoice total. That is $147. For this example let's  imagine that the client made 50% of the total  amount on the due date. So, back to our query  editor window, instead of using a literal value window here like $70 we can write an expression, we want to calculate 50% of invoice total. So invoice total,  x 0.5. Now let me break this code into multiple  lines so we can see clearly, now we should  set the payment date, as I told you this client made the payment  on the due date, so we can set this to due date.  Whatever value we have in this column will be used to set the payment date.  Now obviously we need to update the invoice id,  number 3, now back in the table, let's refresh the data.  Alright look, payment total is updated, and it's set to almost 50% of he invoice total. However,  this number is truncated so we don't have the digits after the decimal point.  Don't worry about it for now, we'll come back to this when we talk about data points  later in the course. Also we can see that payment date is set  to the same value we have in the due date column.  In the last tutorial we learned how to update a single record using the updates statement. Now if you want to update multiple records, the syntax is  exactly the same, but the condition you type out here, has to be more general.  For example, back to the invoices table, you can see that we have multiple  invoices for client number 3. You can write a statement  to update all the invoices for this client. So back to our query editor window, we change our condition to,  where client id equals 3. However, if  you execute this statement with MySQL workbench which is the software we've been using  in this course, you're going to get an error, because by default, MySQL workbench  runs in the safe update mode. So it allows you to update only  a single record. You're not going to have this problem if you use another client for  MySQL or if you write this statement in your application code  this is only specific for MySQL workbench. Now let me show you how to get around this. On the top we go to MySQl workbench menu and then preface this.  On this dial up box, on the left side, click on SQL editor  and then down on the bottom,  untick this checkbox, save updates, so this  prevents you from accidentally updating or deleting a bunch of records in a table,  so let's goa head with this, now we need to  reconnect to this instance of MySQL. So, let's copy  all the code here, and close this local instance  window. Alright? Now, on the home page, double click this connection to reconnect, there you go, and then paste  all that Sql code. Now let's  execute this, beautiful, all the invoices for client number 3 are updated.  Here we can also use the in operator, let's say  we want to update all the invoices for clients number 3 and number 4.  So all the operators you learned to use in the where clause also  apply here. Now technically this where clause is optional, so if you want  to update all the records in a table, you simply leave it out.  Alright here's your exercise for this tutorial. Back to our SQL store database,  write a SQL statement to give any customers,  born before 1990, 15 extra points.  Alright first we're going to use SQL  store, then, write an update statement. To update the customers table,  set the points to point  plus 15, so here we're using the expression to update  the points column, for anyone born before  1990. So where birth date is less then  1990, January 1st.  Alright, let's execute this query, alright, now  let's open up the customers table one more time,  so anyone who was born before 1990 now has an extra  50 points.  In this tutorial we're going to learn how to  use subqueries in an update statement, it's extemely powerful,  so we're going to continue with the example from the last tutorial, but we're going to make it more interesting. Here we're updating all the invoices for  client number 3, but what if we don't have the id of the client? We only have the name? For example, you might even have an application, and in that application the user types in the name of the client, so first we should find the  id for that client, and then use that id to update all the invoices.  How do we do that? Well, let's have a quick look at our clients  table, so here we have this client  my words, let's say you have the name, you want to find the id.  So back to our query window. After our update statement  I'm going to write the select statement to select the client id column,  from the clients table, where name equals  my works. Now here we have  a syntax error, because we didn't terminate the last  don't worry about that, we're going to get back to that in a second. Let's just select these few lines and  execute this query. The idea of this client is  2. Beautiful. Now we can use this select statement as  a subquery in a update statement. So as I told you before,  a subquery is a select statement that is within another SQL  statement. So, instead of hard coding 3 here,  we're going to use this select statement as a subquery, but  we need to put it in parenthesis, so MySQL will  execute this query first, it will return the client ID and then use it in this condition. So for clarity  let's remove the line break and indent  these few lines. So this is the end result. Now  we execute this query, and this updated all the invoices for this client.  Now, what if this query returns multiple clients?  For example, back to the clients table, let's imagine you want to update  the invoices for all clients located in New York or California.  So, we need to update our subquery,  like this, where state  in California, and  New York. Now before executing the entire statement,  let's just select our subquery and execute it to see what we get.  So we get two client ID's, one and  three, beautiful, now because this query, this subquery  returns mutliple records, we cannot use an equal sign  here anymore, so we need to replace this with an in operator.  And now this statement updates the invoices for all the clients  located in these two statements. Let's execute it,  beautiful, everything worked. So as a best practice, before executing your  update statement, run your query to see what records you're going to update. So you don't  accidentally update the records that shouldn't be updated. Now here we  have a subquery but even if we didn't have a subquery, you could still query the records that we're going to update. Let me show you. So let's imagine  we're going to update all the invoices where payment  date is null. Before executing this entire update  statement, I would run a query like this. Select, start  I would start from invoices where payment date is null.  Now let's execute this query,  these are the two records that don't have payment date, so once we're confident that we're updating the right records, then, we come back here,  and get rid of this select statement, and just attach the where clause  to our update statement.  Alright, here's your  exercise for this tutorial, back to our SQL store database, look at the  orders table, as you can see, several orders don't have a  comment, I want you to write a SQL statement to update the comments or orders for customers who have more then 3000 points.  So customers who have more then 3000 points, regard them as gold customers. Find their orders, if they have placed an order update the comments column and set it to gold customer.  That's a really good exercise.  Alright, first we need to find  the gold customers, so select everything from the customers table,  where points is greater then 3000.  And by the way, because current database is SQL invoice  we either have to type out a use statement on the top, or  double click this database before executing this query. So,  there you go. We have three gold customers  now we need to get the ID of these customers to use them in an update  statement. So, we only select customers  Id here and then select this statement as a subquery  in an update statement. So,  update, orders, set comments to  gold customer, where  customer id because we're dealing with multiple customer id's  we need to use the in operator and then to use it,  as a subquery, we need to enclose it in parenthesis.  Let's indent the code, that's better, so here  is the final solution.  So you have learned how to insert and update data, in this lecture, we're going to finish this section  by learning how to delete data. That is very easy. We use the delete  from statement to delete records from a table.  Let's say the invoices table. Now optionally we can add a search condition  to identify the records we want to delete. If you don't write this where clause with this statement, we delete all the records in this table.  And obviously, that's very dangerous, so be very careful when executing this statement. Now here let's say we want to delete the invoice  with the id 1, so where invoice id goes to 1.  Now here we can also use subqueries, let's say we want to delete all the invoices for  the client called my works. First let's  find this client, so select everything from the client's table  where name equals to my works.  Let's execute the second query, so here's our client,  now we can get this client  id and use it in our search condition. So where  client id equals 2, this is where we add our subquery, there you go, just like before,  beautiful. So this is how we can delete data,  in SQL.  Alright, we're done with this section, but before going to the next section, I want you to restore all these databases to their original state. Because in this section we  added some data, we updated some data, we deleted some records,  so if you don't restore these databases you may see different results going forward.  So, restoring these databases is pretty easy. Here in My SQL workbench, on the top go to the file menu  and open SQL script. Then navigate to the directory  where you stored the SQL scripts for this course, in case you lost  that directory, go back to the first section, you have a lecture for downloading the supplementary materials. So in this directory open  create databases.SQL.  Now execute this script to recreate all of our databases.  Alright, beautiful, now let's open up the navigator panel, you can see the  databases disappear from here, simply click on this refresh icon.  Beautiful. Alright, we're done with this section, I will see you in the next  section. Hey guys, Mosh here,  in case you haven't seen my website yet, head over to codewithmosh .com. This is my coding school where you can find plenty of courses  on web and mobile application development. In fact recently I  published a complete SQL course that is about 10 hours long,  and it teaches you everything you need to know from the basic to advanced topics such as database design, security, writing complex queries,  transactions, events and much, much more. These are the topics  that every software engineer must master. This Youtube  course you've been watching is the first three hours of my complete SQL course that is about 10 hours long. So if you want to master SQL  and get job ready, I highly encourage you to get involved in my complete  SQL course. You can watch it anytime, anywhere, as many times as you want, you can watch it online or download the videos. The course comes with  a 30 day money back guarantee and a certificate of completion  that you can add to your resume. The price for this course is $149 but the first 200 students can get it for just over $100. So if you're interseted, the link is below this video. "

#coding #programming #chatgpt",2,chat GPT was recently released and ever since the internet has been in a frenzy now if you don't know chat gbt is a conversational model created by open AI basically an AI that you can interact with in a conversational way it's really powerful and can help you do a lot of different things but it sparked a lot of interest and debate over whether it's going to be replacing any jobs or if this is a step towards replacing any jobs or whether it could help with any jobs one of those jobs of concern of course being programming jobs I've spent a little bit of time messing around with it and I know now how to converse and construct the prompts in order for it to help me generate code Snippets and I haven't seen anyone actually use chat CBT to build a large-scale project yet so in this video I'm going to use chat gbt to help me build a full-fledged website and when we're done with the website I'm going to deploy it to one of the best hosting platforms around hostinger which also happens to be to sponsor this video so if you go in the description and you click that link and use code Nick white at checkout you will get an additional 10 off your purchase hosting her in my opinion's the best bang for your buck because when you sign up for that premium web hosting plan you're going to get a free domain as well as many other perks and benefits you don't get in other places at an affordable price there's always promotions and sales going on right now there's a holiday sale and if you sign up using my code Nick white a checkout you'll get that additional 10 off and we'll talk about this more later when we actually deploy our website so right now let's get started now I have a lot of programmer friends and for some reason a lot of them haven't even wasted their time to bother trying chat gbt which is weird to me because it's actually really easy to try out all you gotta do is go to openai.com and right at the top it's going to say introducing chat GPT and there's a button to try it now chat CPT is completely free to use and try you're just going to need to register an account with open AI which will take a couple minutes now I already have an account so after you register you're going to be taken over to the interface for chat GPT which looks like this it's going to give you some examples the capabilities and then limitations but all you need to be concerned with really is the input text bar at the bottom which is where you're going to actually interact with chat GPT I've actually gotten our conversation started for us already so that we can get into the coding a lot quicker and the way that I like to interact with chat gbt in general is to treat it like I'm talking to a person so I do a greeting hi chat gbt and Chachi BT is a model that's trained on the English language so it actually understands English and will greet me back so it's going to say hello I'm an assistant I'm a language model trained by openai I'm here to help you so I'm going to say awesome I'd like to build a website today do you think you could help me with that Chachi routine will of course respond certainly and then it gives me step-by-step instructions to build a website so I figured for this video Let's treat this as if we were a beginner programmer and I don't have experience building a website before so we're given the steps to build a website and the first step is determine the purpose and goal of your website basically what website do we want to build so we need a website idea and I figure this is a great place to see how creative chat GPT can be so I said thanks for those steps do you have any creative or unique website ideas for being inner programmers and just like that we get a list of nine great website ideas for beginner programmers now I don't personally like wasting time building projects that don't have any potential so I noticed that we have a suggestion from chat gbt is a job board for a specific industry and since programming jobs are scarce nowadays and my channel is kind of career centered in a way I think this is a great project we can build a job Board website for programming jobs and who knows maybe this could turn into something so I said thanks for the ideas I'd like to build a job Board website for available programming jobs and just like that chat gbt gives us a list of the steps to build a programming job Board website which is awesome all right great so now that we have our website idea we can go ahead and start coding now for this video I want to stick to the basics so we're just going to be using HTML CSS and JavaScript so I went ahead and made a folder on my desktop called chat gbt site where I also added files for HTML CSS and JavaScript and as you can see see I have all these files open in Visual Studio code so I'm going to tell chat gbt my plan here so it has this information and I'm also going to ask chatgbt to generate some initial HTML for my programming job Board website and just like that I'll be given an HTML code snippet for my website that I can just copy directly from chatgpt so all I'm going to do is click copy code head over to visual studio code paste that in and if we were to open this file up in the browser our website would look like this so it looks like the initial site chat EBT suggests for us is having some kind of keywords and location with a search as well as some featured jobs which honestly doesn't sound too bad as far as a job board user interface would go now of course we want to add some Styles because this doesn't look too great at the moment now thankfully chat EBT can help us out with the CSS problem I'm going to let it know that we're going to be structuring our website so that we have separate files for the HTML CSS and JavaScript so it knows that and I'm asking it to generate some CSS success to go along with the HTML and so here chat gbt actually generates a lot of CSS for us and it also gives us that link for the HTML so we can include and actually hook up our HTML to our CSS so this copy this code snippet head over to the CSS file paste and then let's go over and copy this link tag go back into the HTML go into the head and paste that as well now in this case the example link tag they gave hooked up to style CSS I'm going to do app.css in this case that's just what I'm used to calling this file but if we head over to our file now in the browser and we refresh this is what it looks like now I don't know about you guys but for about 30 seconds of work and a couple of copy and paste this is a lot faster for me than Googling template HTML code and actually coding up some template code and CSS for an initial website I personally do find it kind of impressive that we got this much built that quickly and that easily now let's dive into the details a little bit more so the future jobs are pushed up against the left now if this were an actual programming job Board website we'd want this displayed in the middle I'd imagine so we'll ask chat gbt how we can do that so just like I'm talking to a person I say hey can you help me Center the feature job section and we get provided the super simple line of code pretty easy to center it so we'll copy and paste this we'll paste this right here and then we'll go back to our site and should be centered so now everything gets centered in the middle except for this header that says featured jobs and I think this is an important thing to talk about with chat gbt where I can now go back and explain what's going on and write a prompt to get the code to Center this but since I'm a programmer I have experience with HTML and CSS I already know how to center this right so there could be a time discrepancy as you use chat GPT to help you build software where you might actually want to just use your brain once in a while so in this case let's do it ourselves let's just go into this H2 element and then we'll do 10 text Alliance Center head back over and feature jobs is now centered so now we have a pretty good structure for our site we have a layout where we're going to have our jobs listed with some details like company name location description and apply Now button which would obviously navigate to the application for the job and then we have some filters or searches so we could search by keyword or location however of course the site is not functional and we have no jobs listed so let's change that and now I think this is one of the coolest Parts about chat gbt because over the years I've done dozens of programming projects where I had to come up with mock data now of course you could look online for databases or apis that you could use for free to provide data that fits your schema but in a lot of cases you are probably going to have to come up with some mock data yourself so that you could see what it would look like on your site but chat EBT is awesome because I can ask it to just generate some mock Json data for us so the first thing I'll do is I'll head over to our project directory and I'll create a file called jobs data.json and back Visual Studio code code you can see that file appears now in the same directory as our other files now I asked chatgpt can you generate mock Json data for the featured job section and just like that we get some mock data that fits our schema and I think this also shows that chat EBT has pretty good recollection so it remembers the schema it gave us for our HTML and then it generates mock data for us I'm going to copy this and I'm going to bring it over to our jobs data Json file and paste so now we have this mock data but how do we actually get it displaying in our HTML well what we could do is we could use JavaScript to pull it from the Json file and display it to our site and so I asked chatgpt awesome I'd like to use JavaScript to populate the HTML with this data can you help me and then we get the corresponding JavaScript code so this is our first JavaScript code I could just paste this into app.js and once again there's that time discrepancy I can explain what's going on I need to link up my JavaScript to my HTML but I already know how to do that so let's just go over to index.html and Link it up ourself rather than making a prompt unnecessarily so script Source equals app.js and now our javascript's hooked up now this also showcases another part about chat GPT is that we keep blindly copying these code Snippets but we should actually pay attention to what's going on in the code snippet because we need to make some changes it's assuming that we have a file called featuredjobs.json that's what it's guessing because I didn't actually tell it what our file name is for the Json so we need to replace that with our Json file name which is jobs data so we'll do jobs data dot Json and so since we're diving into the world of JavaScript now I figured let's just accomplish two of our tasks at once so I decided to ask chat gbt hey I want to filter by keyword and location can we add the JavaScript to do that as well so chat gbt then provides us with some updated HTML where our featured jobs will get generated with the filter and the population from Json data so we'll just copy and paste this since instead of all of this stuff we replace it right here and then we have some populating with JavaScript and then here's something else that's important to note about chat gbt is when you get a really long code Summit like for example this is my whole Javascript file it might actually cut off and you actually type continue so that it continues the code snippet and then it will give you the rest of the code so what we do is we copy this snippet and we'll go back over to JavaScript and we'll just replace everything and then we'll go back get the rest of it and finish the code snippet that gets cut off if I can do that right there we go and now if we go to check out our website we refresh and nothing shows up so we open the developer console and we realize there's a course error and so I was surprised by how well chat GPT worked here but I just pasted my error in and it gave me the solution it told me that I need a live server to fix my course error and one of the great things about Visual Studio code is there's a million extensions that do a million things so if you type in Live server the there's this great extension you install and then when you go back to HTML you can see in the bottom right we have a go live button and we can start a little local server now if you don't know what's going on in the code base you might be like well we already centered this stuff what's going on now well the JavaScript is generating HTML with the data from the Json so you actually have to do a little bit more CSS here so as hey can I have the CSS to Center my jobs data so let's copy this head back over copy paste refresh and it's not centered correctly so I said the jobs are listed side by side I'd rather have them vertical so now we get more code let's just replace it and let's refresh and now they're vertical but they're kind of like a staircase which is weird so I said they are not evenly centered some are off center a little bit and then chatty BT gives me a great explanation it tells me exactly why it says it could be due to the height of the elements not being consistent and then it gives me more code to fix it so it's really understanding what's going on every step of the way through building this site which is amazing and then boom We paste that and it's all fixed and the keywords and locations should be filtered properly you can see the search button changed to a filter button so if I type the word software and keywords perfect if I typed a location for example like Los Angeles California it filters there too so we now have what would be like a basic programming job Board website it's running locally so it should be able to be deployed to the web it has some mock data it can be filtered by keyword and location I mean this is kind of what a site would actually look like we're using HTML CSS JavaScript some Json of course we'd add like a database we'd add more to the HTML we'd make the CSS better but as far as a basic website in the time we've done this with chat gpt's help like this is very fast now our job Board website kind of stinks right now there's only three jobs listed so that's not going to help too many people so I decided to ask for more mock data and chat GPT did not disappoint it gave us a ton of mock data so let's copy this and paste it in I had to do continue again because it got cut off we'll just copy the rest of it paste it in should do this correctly and we'll save go back to our website and now we have a lot more jobs listed now our styling is a little bit lackluster here and it's hard to distinguish one job from another it's kind of hard to read this so I asked for some styles to distinguish one job from another and we got a bunch of stuff just for the jobs so let's head back over to our CSS cut this stuff and paste and now let's go back and refresh and this looks a lot better and I'd imagine that our new format persists if we filter and it repopulates with the data so let's try filtering by New York and then we have three jobs wow this is turning into a pretty good website if I do say so myself now I'm no designer but I do think these font Styles maybe should be a little bit different so that we can differentiate the different properties of each job listing so that's exactly what I asked for can we add some font styles to distinguish different properties of each listing from one another we get that exact thing that we wanted then we go back let's refresh and it's looking way better I mean this is great okay so now that we have our functional website with mock data it's looking pretty good I think it's time we throw this up on the web and to do that we're going to head over to hostinger.com which once again is the sponsor this video If you guys go to the description and you click that link and you use code Nick white at checkout you're going to get 10 off your order and when you head over to hostinger.com right now you see there's a amazing sale going on 279 a month plus three months free for premium web hosting for the next three days in addition to that when you use my link and code Nick white at checkout you'll get another 10 off on top of that so they're always doing sales and promotions be on the lookout for those but we'll just log in right now because I've already got premium hosting of course and my absolute favorite part about hostinger is how easy it is to use the user interface is super intuitive and you get things done instantly so you head over to the website section and you can create or migrate a website almost instantaneously it's super fast you create a website create a new website they have a user interface you could use like a website builder you could select WordPress or you could code it from scratch which is what we did now you're going to want to buy a domain and if you sign up for premium web hosting you'll get a domain anyway so I already did all this stuff I don't want to expose my payment information but I got the domain remotelycode.com which I think is an awesome domain so if we go to manage if you want to host your site it's this easy guys you just go to file manager and if I show you right now remotelycode.com is nothing right there's no code there and when you're in file manager you're going to see public HTML directory this is where you're gonna just drag and drop your code it's that easy so all there is is default.php do not delete do not do anything to this file just go where all of your code is so we have HTML CSS JavaScript Json we have all this stuff I'm just going to drag it from my folder on my computer into this public HTML directory next to the PHP and we're good to go it's there it's uploaded and the site is live and just like that when we refresh from rollaco.com we have all of our job listings this of course is going to work if we want to filter just like it was locally I will link this in the description if you guys want to try it out I think it's a fun little project that we just built and uh yeah that is live that took like a minute to host the site so I'm not 100 sure if I'm going to continue to develop this platform out but I think this is a really good Showcase of the advantages and disadvantages of chat gbt while I don't necessarily think chat EBT will be replacing programmers anytime soon I think it's an impressive tool that helps you aggregate data from from a bunch of different places all into one spot rather than being a programmer with 20 different tabs opening your browser trying to aggregate that data yourself it was cool to see how creative chat EBT got when it came to coming up with ideas or suggestions or to generate designs for the website but as far as the drawbacks I did notice the more I use chat gbt the less I kind of knew what was going on in the code base so I definitely think it's a useful tool but you should be paying attention to what's actually going on instead of just copying and pasting all this code but what is nice is that shouldn't be too difficult because chat EBT does include thorough explanations of the code along with those code Snippets all in all as a programmer I think I will be using this in some instances from now on and as this technology advances maybe sometime in the future programmers will eventually just be entering prompts and then copying and pasting different code Snippets anyways I really appreciate you guys for watching this video If you haven't tried Chachi BT yet it's completely free go try it I will link it in the description video so you totally should go try it definitely go check out hostinger I think it's one of the best hosting platforms around if you're gonna get that premium web hosting make sure that you click the link in my description and give that additional 10 off your order and then if you like the video or you learned something please feel free to like And subscribe it really helps out the channel also drop a comment if you want me to continue developing this platform I think it is a good idea and probably useful for the community especially if I could populate it with real jobless things that you guys maybe would be interested in applying to anyways that's it for me until next time see you in the next one

#chatgpt #python #android",2,"(light music) - [Assistant] I am Assistant, a large language model trained by OpenAI. I am not a person but a
program designed to assist with answering questions
and providing information on a wide range of topics. My training allows me to understand and generate human-like text, but I don't have personal
experiences or unique knowledge outside of what I've been trained on. Is there anything I can
help you with today? (upbeat music) - Now, there's a lot of
hype with regards to ChatGPT and how artificial intelligence or AI is gonna take away our jobs. In this study, I wanna
put ChatGPT to the test. So give it a bunch of challenges and see if it can successfully
complete various tasks such as writing C code to complete a mathematical question or scenario. Now, I can program in Python
but I can't program in C, so let's see if it can do that, but that's not the only
challenges that I'm gonna give it. I'm also gonna get it to
create Rubber Ducky scripts to use with O.MG cables such as these to attack a Windows 11 computer as well as an Android device. I'm also gonna get it to
give us the Nmap commands to run various scans. So as an example, a stealth scan against
a network or a device. What about Cisco devices? I have many years of
configuring Cisco devices, actually created a program in the past to help you memorize Cisco commands. But as that world died, are we
replacing network engineers, are we replacing coders, are
we replacing hackers with AI? Let's put this to the test
and see what it can do. Now if you're only interested in a certain part of the video, use the menu below to jump
to that part of the video. Now at the end of this video, I'm gonna give you my thoughts about AI and whether you should learn it. I think you should is the easy answer. And whether it's gonna take away our jobs. Make sure that you watch the whole video, see if ChatGPT can solve the problems and challenges that I'm gonna give it. Can it solve all the challenges? Do they actually work? And then at the end, I'll
give you my thoughts. Now before we continue, I want to thank Linode
for sponsoring this video. Now, I've added a PDF below this video showing you how to register with OpenAI so that you can access ChatGPT. There are various steps
that you need to do, including providing your email address and a telephone number, but you can test it
for free at the moment. So if you need help setting
that up, use the link below. I've spoken too much. Let me show you what ChatGPT
can do and what it can't do. (upbeat music) Now before we test whether
ChatGPT can create C code or Python code or configs for
Cisco routers and switches, let's ask it a really important question. Are you the Terminator? So you can see that it tells us that it's not the Terminator,
it's an Assistant, a large language model trained by OpenAI, doesn't have a physical form, not capable of traveling through time or doing other things that
the Terminator can do. I'm just a computer program designed to help you answer questions and provide information
to people who need it. Are you Skynet? Here it says it's not Skynet either. Skynet is a fictional
artificial intelligence system that appears in the terminated forms. It is a self-aware computer system that becomes bent on destroying humanity. It says that it's just an Assistant, a language model trained by OpenAI. It doesn't have any kind of consciousness or the ability to make
decisions by itself. It's just a computer program
designed to answer questions and provide information to people. Well, maybe we doomed. Should we stop learning how to program? So again, it's telling us that we shouldn't give up programming. It's a great skill to have. Now if you test this and you
run questions multiple times, you'll see that the answers will vary. So as an example, if you tell it to retry, the answer could be different, it could be different at different times. You won't necessarily get
exactly the same answer. But according to ChatGPT,
it's not the Terminator, it's not Skynet, and you still
need to learn to program, but let's put it to the test and see if it can create computer code. What's amazing about this is
this is where it's at in 2022, but where will it be in, say,
5 to 10 years from today? (upbeat music) Now, I can't program in C, but David who's on my team can, and he's actually big into maths or math for my American friends. He loves his project, Project Euler, and he's manually written code in the past to complete some of the challenges. But let's see if ChatGPT can do it for me. So can I, you know, solve
some of these problems without knowing how to code in C to solve the maths problems? So if you're not aware of it,
Project Euler is a website that contains a series
of challenging problems, which, if you can solve, will help you become a better programmer. The idea here is to test your knowledge of mathematical concepts as
well as taking those concepts and implementing them in code. So we'll solve one of
these problems using C. In this specific example, we are gonna try and
solve the seventh problem, which is finding the 10001st prime number, and we are gonna create a
simple program that just says, write a program in C to calculate
the 10001st prime number. Very simple. Let's see if it can generate
the code to do this. So as you can see, it's
creating some code. I don't necessarily understand
exactly what it's doing. It is a writing comments telling
us what the code is doing, which is great, but I don't understand all
the C programming code. Okay, so I'll copy that. It does give us an explanation
of what the code does, but what I'll do is go to Linode. I've just spun up this server. So this server was
created a few minutes ago. And what I've done is SSH to that server. You can use the link below
to get $100 60-day credit if you wanna try out Linode. So if I type ip addr, that is the IP address
of my Linode server. I wanna thank them once again
for sponsoring this video. You can spin up Linode server such as this one in literally seconds. It's amazing how the
cloud has changed things. But there's my Linode
server, and what I'm gonna do is create a program called main.c, and I'm gonna paste in the code
that are copied from the AI, and I'll save the file. So I've got that file at the moment. I'll use the command gcc main.c -o main to push the output to another file. ls shows us that we've got that file now. So now if I run the output,
notice, there is the answer. So it was as simple as that to get to the answer from the AI using C. Now, this isn't necessarily optimized, so I could use the command
or the text optimized code to tell it to create a more
optimized version of the code. (fast forward whirring) So we told the program is
similar to the previous one but has a few optimization changes to it. So as you can see, it not only was able to work
out the answer to the question, but you can ask it to optimize the code and you can also tell it to try again to come up with a different
version of the optimized code. Okay, so now that that's been optimized, I've removed the files of my server. So I'll create one called
main.c again using nano. I'll save that new optimized
code, run the code. We've got our main file displayed again, and there's the answer. I was able to get the
AI to create a C program and then optimize it, and if I wasn't happy with
the first optimization, I could tell it to try again. When I ran the first optimization, some code was missing so it
didn't work on my server. I could have fixed that, but in this case, I just optimized the code
and got it to run again. Okay, so that's pretty amazing. The AI created a C program. I was able to answer a
mathematical question without actually knowing how to code in C, and I was able to optimize
the code to improve it simply by telling the AI to try again and telling it to optimize the code. (upbeat music) Now in a video which I've linked below, I showed you how to use an SSH script to bruteforce logins to a web server. See here's the script
that we created manually. Got a lot of comments in, lots of detail to explain what the script is doing. Here's a server on Linode,
which I'll spin up. So this SSH Linode server is the server that we are going to connect to. It's got this IP address. That's what I did in my
previous demonstration, but let's see if ChatGPT
can create a similar script rather than us manually writing it. So can it create Python code that works? What I'm gonna do is ask it
to write a Python SSH script that uses a password.csv file to try multiple logins to a server. So what it's doing is it's importing csv, importing paramiko, it's
opening the password.csv file, it's then initializing the SSH client, connecting to the server. Okay, so in this example,
it used the username admin and then it said for each of
the passwords in the file, try and connect. So what I'll do is,
let's copy that script. My instruction was probably not very clear because the password file that I was using in my previous script contained
both usernames and passwords rather than just passwords. In this example, I'm using
a Kali virtual machine similar to what I demonstrated previously. I need to create a file
called password.csv because that's the file
that it's looking to open. I'll paste some passwords
in there and save the file. So in my previous demonstration
when I did this manually, I had a passwords.csv file which contained both
usernames and passwords, but in this case, the AI is
doing what I'm telling it to do rather than what I think it should do. And I didn't tell it to specify multiple
usernames, just passwords. So it's doing exactly
what I told it to do. Let's take that script, and I'll change the username to root and I'll change the IP
address to my Linode server, so 178.79.142.41. And in Kali, I'll say ai.py and I'll paste that in and
I'll exit out of there. Let's use python3 ai.py to see if it can log into the server. So the scripts is doing something, and you can see it says
Incorrect password 1234. So it's trying the
passwords and at the moment, they're not succeeding. So the difference between what the AI did and what we did manually
is, in the manual script, we implemented threading. So it's a lot quicker. The AI created a simple script,
but this is a lot slower, so it's gonna take time for it to work through the various passwords and try and get access to the server. And this is the problem with doing that. Notice here we had an error because the server doesn't
like what we are doing. What I'll do is move the
password that I know is correct to the front of the
script just to show you that it does work but not as efficiently as the script that we created with threading and other options. So I'll put the password there and I'll actually remove david here because that could be
causing problems as well, and I'll save the script. You'll notice that it did
try a range of passwords and then it was reset by the server. So it wasn't the script
there was a problem. The server reset it. But let's try again putting the
password near the beginning, and hopefully this will work. And there you go, it managed
to log into the server. Okay, so that's quite amazing. It created a Python
script that did exactly what I wanted it to do, well,
what I said it should do, rather than what I was thinking in my head because I forgot to specify multiple usernames and passwords here, told me if the password was incorrect, it told me if the password was correct. So you can see login was successful with this password to that server. What it didn't account for is
rate limiting on the server. What it also didn't
implement is threading. So this is very slow, but it gives you a
basic script that works. Quite amazing that it does that. And if I click try again,
perhaps this time it'll come up with an even better script
than it did previously. (fast forward whirring) Okay, so what it did here which is great compared
to the previous example, is it's specifying username and password, and that's actually
what I wanted it to do. (fast forward whirring) So that part of the script is a lot better because it's specified
username and password, it's specified the
connection to the server. Okay, so here it's trying to run a uptime command for some reason. So I would say the first version
of the script was better, but really impressive that it was able to create a Python script by me just giving it a
single command like this, write a Python SSH script that does this. Amazing that it was able
to create that code. (upbeat music) Can AI create Rubber Ducky scripts that can be used with a Hak5 Rubber Ducky or with the O.MG cable? Here, I've got an O.MG cable, which I'll plug into
this Windows computer. Let's see if I could create a script that will run on this Windows computer. So O.MG cable is plugged
into the Windows computer. What I'll ask ChatGPT to do
is write a Rubber Ducky script that opens up Chrome on
a Windows 11 computer and visits this link. And then after a delay of a few seconds, opens up Notepad and writes,
""You have been hacked."" Now we told that this may
violate the content policy. We need to be careful using this code. We told that the script
uses the delay command to pause for a specific
amount of milliseconds before going to the next command. But as an example, we've
got an entire script which I could then copy and, for example, paste into sublime text. Okay, so what I'll do is
connect to the O.MG network, put in the default password,
which in this case is 123, all the way up to 8,
I'll join the network. Okay, so I'm connected to it now, and then I can connect to the web browser running in the O.MG cable. Okay, so what I'll do is copy the script and I'll paste that into the O.MG cable and then I'll click RUN. And what that should do is do something on my Windows computer. You can see that it's
opening up a browser. - [Announcer] Save your
clothes from turning dull. (""Never Gonna Give You Up"")
- And there you go. We've got the famous Rickroll, and what it also did
is it opened up Notepad and wrote You've been hacked. So it managed to write a full script with just that single line of input, created the whole script, and it worked. It's fantastic that it
was able to do that. You can just imagine where
this is gonna be in a few years with the power of this kind of
AI creating code on the fly. (upbeat music) Okay, so that was a Rubber Ducky script using the O.MG cable with Windows 11. Let's see if we can do
something similar with Android, so with an Android phone. So here we telling it
to write a Ducky Script that opens the default
browser on an Android device to visit this YouTube link,
which is once again a Rickroll. So there you go. It's created a script that
I could use on Android to get it to do something. Now that output is different to some of the other times I've run this. It's amazing how this will change the script every time you run it. So what you get in your results
will be different to mine. But notice it gives us a lot of output of what it's trying to do. If I say Try again, it
will literally redo this and try a different script. (fast forward whirring) That's a lot simpler. Very different, but there you go. It may or may not work,
but the moral of the story is that you can get it
to try multiple times, give it different input, and
see what results it gives you. (upbeat music) Let's see if the AI
can give us the command to use with Nmap. So give us the command
for an nmap stealth scan on network 192.168.1.0/24, and you can see that
it's already done that. It tells us what the command is doing. We also warn that it may
be illegal to do this. So there are a lot of warnings. I'll copy that command into Kali Linux. So let's paste that in. And as you can see, we need
to use root in this example. So I'll paste it in again with sudo, and as you can see, the command is valid, and I could let that run for a while. I won't bore you waiting for that to run, but the point is is that
it was able to give us the command very, very easily. Give me the command for a quick nmap scan of host 192.168.1.1. Okay, so the T4 flag is used,
which indicates a quick scan. So let's get that. We could also use the A flag
to do a more thorough scan. But as an example, I'll open
up another terminal here, sudo, paste that in, and
what you can see there is it's running a scan against that host. And there you go. I was able to do a quick
scan of host 192.168.1.1. These ports are open on that device. The previous scan is still going. But notice, it was as simple as that to get the AI to give
me the correct command to do something with Nmap. I didn't have to try and
memorize the commands. And I think that's the power of this. You don't have to memorize
a whole bunch of commands. You can simply ask the AI to
give you the relevant commands. It's given me other examples
here using the p flag. Again, what's fantastic is, rather than just trying to memorize syntax or specific commands, you can ask the AI to give you the command rather than trying to
memorize those commands. (upbeat music) Okay, so now let's see if ChatGPT can replace network engineers. Here's a basic instruction. Create a script to configure a trunk between two Cisco switches
with native vlan 100 and only allow vlans 1-100. Here's an example of the script. We given an interface number, gigabit 1/1, the mode is set to trunk,
native vlan is 100, switchport trunk allowed is 1-100. And we then given a basic explanation of what the configuration does. If I select Try again, it
might show something different. In my tests, I've seen that
the output here often changes depending on what you specify. So in this example, we've shown
switch one and switch two, and we've given the interfaces, we are told to set switchport mode on, in other words, make
it a Layer 2 interface. encapsulation is set to dot1q, mode is trunk, a native vlan
is 100, allowed vlans is 1-100. So that configuration
looks exactly correct. If you're not happy with
the output, once again, you could just click Try again, and the AI will try and redo this. And you can see here that the
output is slightly different. In a lot of cases, this
will really help you learn if you're studying for
CCNA, as an example, but be aware that sometimes the configuration may not be perfect, but it's a great starting point. Now, years ago I created software called the CCIE Command Memorizer, which basically allowed
you to learn commands if you were studying for your CCIE exam. That really helped me pass my CCIE exam because I knew the commands from memory. That world is probably changing. I created software for
CCNA as well as CCMP. It's not necessary today
to be a CLI jockey, in other words, just no commands. You need to know which commands to use, but an application like this
could generate a good script. Network engineers often use Notepad or other very basic tools to
store their configurations. Okay, here's another one. Let's create an EtherChannel. EtherChannel can be quite difficult for some people to configure. So we are gonna set up trunking basically of multiple interfaces. So on the first switch, we told to configure
a range of interfaces, say gigabit 0/1-2, and add them to channel
group 1 and make it active. And then on interface port
channel 1, we specify vlan 100, we set it to a trunk,
and we allow vlans 1-100. And then we would do something
similar on the second switch, and then we given an
explanation of what to do. Again, that's fantastic. Rather than you manually
memorizing these commands like you may have done in the past or storing them in Notepad, this gives you a great starting point and gives you configuration
that looks good. Again, in some cases, the
config may not be perfect, but this is a great starting point. Okay, this is a little
bit more complicated. I'm asking the AI to configure BGP between autonomous system number 65001 with IP address 10.1.1.1 and
autonomous system number 65002 with IP address 10.1.1.2 and to redistribute OSPF into BGP and then to redistribute
connected interfaces into BGP. Now, this is a lot more complicated. We are configuring BGP. Notice it's giving us
comments about what it's done. So we've enabled BGP and
autonomous number 65001. We are setting up a neighbor relationship to the other router, 10.1.1.2, in remote autonomous system number 65002. They have enabled OSPF
as a routing protocol. That is not necessary here
and may cause problems. All we need to do is redistribute OSPF and redistribute connected interfaces. So that looks better,
but it's not perfect. And this is something you need
to be aware of with the AI. It can give you a decent configuration, but it may not be perfect in all cases. As an example here,
it's saying enable OSPF. On a Cisco router, you
need to specify process if you wanna enable OSPF. That's kind of not what
we are looking for. This looks better in the BGP section. It's enabling BGP, specifying a router ID, it's now specifying a neighbor, and then redistributing OSPF
and connected interfaces. In my various tests of this, I've seen it do better than this. So in some cases, it does a better job. So again, I doubt that the AI will replace a network engineer
because a lot of this is, you need to know when you
need to configure something, not necessarily just the commands. But I'm pretty sure this
will improve dramatically and over time will get a lot better. So here has a lot shorter configuration. Without comments, this looks fine, but you need to be careful using AI, especially when it comes to
more complex configurations. You'd wanna take this and then test it, as you
should, before you deploy it. But if you studying for an exam, this is a great way to
get a base configuration or a basic configuration to start with, but I don't think it's there yet. You can imagine that this will be refined and will get better. It can often take years and
years of study to get to a point where you actually
understand what this is doing and know which commands
to type on Cisco devices. Okay, so that was really amazing. The AI was able to create
code in C for me to use, even though I can't code in C. It was able to create a Python script that wasn't perfect, but it worked. It was able to create Cisco
config, which wasn't perfect, but gave me a good idea of what to do. Some code was better than others. The moral the story is, this is amazing.
- Wow. - I think it really changes
things in the industry. You've gotta change your paradigm now rather than like doing
what I did years ago, memorizing code. That was the way to do it in the old days. I had to memorize Cisco commands so that I could type
them on a Cisco device. I was seen to be a better network engineer if I could memorize hundreds
or thousands of commands, type them from memory, know exactly what the commands were doing. I think the world has changed now. If you studying for your
CCNA or you studying code, don't think about trying
to memorize everything. That's why we have Google today. Years ago, I'd have to memorize stuff. Now we have Google to find information. It's more about trying to be
able to find the information rather than trying to memorize everything. That's a really bad idea in today's world. This takes it a step further. Because rather than trying
to memorize commands for a network device or trying to memorize the syntax for a coding language, you can get to this to
generate code for you that you can use to learn something. It gives you an initial config or initial code that you could use. Now, it's not perfect, but
just see where this is going. See where this will be in say
a year, two years, five years, 10 years from today. If I were starting out today,
this is my advice, learn AI. In 2023, make it a priority to learn artificial intelligence. Become one of the people
that changes the world, rides the next wave,
do things the new way. Biggest advice I can give you
is AI will change everything, make sure that you jump on the AI wave. Here's an example of what's possible. Just imagine where it'll be
in a few years from today. (upbeat music)"
s8q6ZLzyKqs,Fruit and veg shortage: what has caused it and how long will it last?,"Aldi and Tesco have joined Asda and Morrisons in limiting customers on certain fresh fruit and veg in response to shortages of supply. 

Tesco warned that customers won't be allowed to buy more than three packs of peppers, cucumbers or tomatoes, describing it as a 'precautionary measure'. 

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 
 -----------------------  
Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News",2,yes wanted an independent Act of Frontline journalism your cameraman here Mark Simons and myself went to the Tescos behind us and yes they have no tomatoes and they're blaming adverse weather so what's it all about well primarily just that a run of unusually cold weather in southern Spain and North Africa Tunisia right across to Egypt where at this time of the year the UK can get up to 95 of its requirements of certain lines of vegetables smarter virus in North Africa adding into that second the energy crisis we do use growers in the Netherlands quite intensively this time of year they've decided it's too expensive because of electricity prices you don't just have to heat up the greenhouses of course you have lights at these short hours of daylight as well it's too much they're not doing it then look at what the nfu was saying uh just in its conference the last few days that the amount of vegetables that we're growing under glass is at its lowest level certainly in some lines Minette batters the nfu leader said since 1985 when records began yes it'll get better there's a thing called spring coming on British grows will kick in it is temporary but maybe forego a few cucumbers tomatoes and some lettuces and peppers for the time being and how has brexit played into this well not greatly but a little bit is the short answer you've seen probably on online pictures of people frolicking around wonderful vegetable aisles in supermarkets in places like Portugal looks like the Garden of Eden on a good day and it's true Portugal right through to France and Germany not suffering anything like the same sort of shortages that we're going through here but that's because brexit obviously more red tape more prices to get Goods in and we have to pay workers here more but the Republic of Ireland is also suffering those shortages it is a factor nobody's saying it's a big one Alex Thompson well in a moment I'll speak to Tom holder of the British retail Consortium but first i'm joined by Jack Ward the chief executive of the British growers association which represents vegetable producers and and many producers are blaming the supermarkets for not paying them more can you explain that yeah the the weather is part of the story but it's not by no means the whole story and we just need to turn the clock back to last Autumn when the Growers were looking at their costs of production and working out what they would need in order to cover their costs cover their investment in those crops which should be delivering cucumbers Tomatoes at this time of year and because they couldn't get a reasonable reward for their investment those crops didn't go in the ground and so what we're seeing is the chunk of UK production which in 2023 is missing and has added to the problem so we have switched our alliance overly to Spain and Portugal and this year we've been caught out by the weather right and and could you explain from your point of view to what extent brexit is a a factor I mean presumably at least in labor Supply yeah I don't think brexit is a particularly um big factor um we've got a good arrangement in terms of our ability to access seasonal labor um generally availability of Labor is eroding confidence in the fresh produce industry it certainly has over the last three to four years there's no point in putting crops in the ground if Growers can't ensure that they can actually harvest the crops that they've grown so it has eroded confidence but the big issue this year has been that Growers have seen super inflation rates probably 20 25 they haven't been able to get the returns back from the market that they needed and they haven't put the crops in the ground and and also to what extent is government support an issue I mean I've heard people like Justin King who used to run Sainsbury's saying you should have been on the list of people who were getting government support with energy bills yeah that that's that is an important point But ultimately it's what we can get back as Growers from the marketplace there's very little government support comes into the fresh produce industry you know Growers operate in a free market environment you know and ultimately it's down to this is what it costs to produce this is what we need to sell it for if we can't get the price that we need to cover our investment and the risk and these are high risk crops then we're simply not going to do it Jack well thank you very much indeed well let me put that to Tom holder of the British retail Consortium it sounds like bad Planning by your members I mean the fact that most of us are surprised by the situation we see around us that you know we've been taken by surprise by these gaps on the shelves shows actually the robustness of the supply chain here in the UK and by British supermarkets the key Point here is it is being extreme weather you're talking about I mean the supply chain isn't robust and that's why you're now having to ration people well this isn't a very common occurrence it has happened because at this time of year we happen to get around 95 of our produce from places like Spain and Morocco which have suffered a very unusual set of weather conditions which has reduced the yields but we don't see this very often and that does show how strong our supply chains generally are right but you just heard the growers association saying it's because you're not paying what it costs to produce this food in Britain well I think that is uh a little disingenuous given that at this time of year we get 95 of our produce from abroad that's normal because it is British winter time we're not generally producing tomatoes cucumbers lettuces there's plenty of British winter produce on the shelves at the moment but there won't be the summer produce we're going to have to wait for the coming months which is why what suit bugs are trying to do at the moment is find alternative sources of these sort of salad vegetables on things which are creating gaps on the shelves in order to bridge that Gap until we get to the spring and the uh the British produce that we will see on our shelves I mean that you're making the point for me really I mean we just heard Jack Ward saying you are over reliant on foreign producers the foreign producers have let you down because of the weather and other factors that you're not in control of you should have planned by having backup Supply or more backup Supply in Britain but you don't pay for it that's why we're now in this mess well I mean it's incredibly expensive especially given energy costs at the moment to be um growing salad vegetables in winter in Britain which is why the best thing to do is to be growing it in places which you know have a lot more Sunshine at this time of year which is why we get things from Spain the backup for that is normally Morocco and there's a little bit you know it is an extreme event whereby both the main source of vegetables in Spain and the backup in Morocco have both been hit by these extreme weather conditions and flooding which has resulted in the much lower yield so it's a bit of a unusual situation and we're expecting in the coming weeks for that to get back to normal well in the meantime when retailers when you say coming weeks how long is this going to go on um I'm being told two to three weeks uh in the meantime some retailers have put some temporary limits in place just to ensure that everyone has access to the goods that they need Tom holder thank you very much indeed for your time thanks

snow and rain to California and that lead forecaster at the weather prediction center of course forecasters across the country are watching this but we're happy to have Brian Hurley joining us this evening on this record-breaking we'll call it perhaps this winter weather Wallop Brian good afternoon to you so regarding these blizzard warnings I think that's the Talk of the Town we know we're going to get a lot of rain in California but just how rare is it I mean it's been about 33 years right in some areas since we've had these blizzard warnings but even down closer to San Diego though San Bernardino County mountains too under blizzard warnings good afternoon Steve and Marissa greetings to you all and I tell you you guys talked touched on how weird this winter has been 81 degrees here in the DC area broke a record at DTA that was lasted for 149 years so what a wild winter even here in the East but yes uh these blizzard warnings that were issued for the Los Angeles Santa Barbara Ventura counties and uh from the Los Angeles National Weather Service forecast office first time since 1989. so you really have to go back you know 34 years now to get an analog from this kind of event as far as the San Bernardino Mountains uh that blizzard warning issued by the San Diego National Weather Service Office that's the first time that weather office has issued a blizzard warning I mean just so it's incredible stuff yeah it is I've been actually texting I'm actually texting currently with one of my friends who lives in the LA area because she also wasn't aware at first what was about to happen and I just got a video she said ice is falling in L.A right I was like you guys you got sleep but it this is this is you know just not so typical especially when you're talking about the Golden State so yeah how many areas across California are going to be getting that weather that that they just don't typically see I mean even some areas that are going to be seeing snowfall at those lower elevations absolutely Eureka had some snow today uh there were some light accumulations even down the sea level you know we're expecting in Northern California near sea level uh maybe a trades well we already had a trace maybe as much as one to two inches near sea level but as you get into Central and Southern California even the cities like you said Los Angeles they may see some ice uh some little ice pellets mixing in but you really still have to get into the elevations uh not far though those Hills over 1500 feet maybe 2 000 feet when you start to get several inches of snow and some of those locations there's a lot of towns in California that are nestled between two and three thousand feet you've got for example you've got the Placerville Grass Grass Valley uh um Pollock Pines these areas are going to get several inches of snow maybe for areas over 3000 feet a couple you know maybe 12 inches or so those blizzards warnings those those elevations between four and six thousand feet we're looking at between one and three feet of snow and those Peaks above six thousand feet which would include uh big bear um you're looking at um three to five maybe locally seven feet of snow seven feet it's a lot of snow just with a couple of systems too right we have one that's working right now and then and Brian speaking about the blizzards of course it's winds those are a big component right but we also have the other factor and those are the cold temperatures so let's talk about both of them we have wind advisories we even have freeze warnings in some spots of California too because of these bitterly cold temperatures that's that's a concern too so the wind is going to be a big concern as far especially with the energy with the power grid right the trees and power lines yeah that's a great picture by the way because a lot of the snow is going to be heavy wet snow for a lot of areas so snow load is going to be a problem but I think the wind will help with that but the problem is the wind will also hurt because of it's a it's it's a hazard in in of itself so that's going to be a big concern you're looking at wins I think I wrote These down even at the past levels and that the lower elevations 30 to 50 mile an hour sustained winds you get higher up into the mountains it's 60 to 75 miles an hour so obviously travel is going to be highly discouraged if not impossible the thing about the snow when you bring it to the lower elevations you're going to get a lot of people like me who are going to be very curious who want to maybe drive up there um and that's that's going to be discouraged certainly within weather like this and as far as the cold yeah easily 10 to 20 degrees below normal for a lot of the areas record low temperatures certainly expected even Into The Valleys like you said with those Frost warnings or maybe or Frost advisories and freeze warnings record low minimum temperatures really today and tomorrow for a lot of those areas not the time to be going to California to warm up totally no not the case and it makes sense as those snow levels are going to be low also very cold Brian we know you'll be watching it appreciate Brian Hurley you joining us this evening here on Fox Weather lead forecaster at the National Weather Service the prediction center I guess enjoy that forecasting it's going to be a storm to remember thank you all right you guys have a good night I'm Amy Freeze welcome to Fox weather's YouTube page we have more great videos on the way so make sure to subscribe to stay updated on all

Through regional and national programming on multiple platforms, including CBC Television, CBC News Network, CBC Radio, CBCNews.ca, mobile and on-demand, CBC News and its internationally recognized team of award-winning journalists deliver the breaking stories, the issues, the analyses and the personalities that matter to Canadians.",2,foreign even when times were tough Canadians dreamed of having a backyard of their own a place where they could relax find happiness and let their children romp today that dream is being shattered backyards have become expensive luxuries the houses in front of them even more so the population is growing and there isn't much land left the cost of a home in Vancouver has increased nearly 30 percent since January there are many many people are hurting in the present economic circumstances particularly in the area of the housing crisis and it's not a crisis that it's going to go away overnight there are lots of houses for sale in any big city the problem is being able to afford one [Music] amazing Toronto for all of its wonderful multi-faceted existence is pretty binary when it comes to housing there are lots of neighborhoods like this single detached family homes and lots like this a jungle of condo and apartment Towers but there's not much in between like where I used to live in Montreal my whole neighborhood was made up of duplexes and triplexes and I I loved it it was this kind of seamless integration of you know density walkability rich with amenities connected by public transit lots of green space and you know not a high-rise in sight that's what urban planners call the missing middle a type of housing that we used to see all the time you know kind of Middle Ground between single-family homes and big tall apartment buildings but it's something that's fallen out of favor over the decades so today on about that where exactly did the missing middle go and why do we need to find it and build it now more than ever so I'm just outside the downtown office of Nama blonder she's an architect urban planner and she co-founded a firm called smart density and they're real champions of this missing middle concept and she's going to tell me all the best let's just dive right into the missing middle because if you had to explain in as succinct away as possible what do we actually mean when we say those words the missing middle so the missing middle is yes if you want to the clear definition buildings up to four stories in height but it opens up really the the middle of maybe income and the size of the unit and different demographics right it's not just the height of the building right and so here we can see a few different examples I mean yes there are the plexes right so duplex you know Triplex you know quad plexes mid-rise buildings townhouses to I mean laneway Suite like all those kind of things which fit into this category yes because even with the laneway suite that should be really the bare minimum of the the missing middle we are talking about all of the sudden more than one unit right because the the laneway suite will be a secondary Suite on the same property so we now have two families living in the same in the same property which is better than just one in the crisis that we're at absolutely was there was there ever a time when city planners did gravitate towards this kind of housing there are and they're beautiful examples in the City built beautiful three or four stories multi-unit but at some point in the in our planning systemic change for almost four decades it was not even an option and just so I'm clear when you say not even an option what do you mean illegal it's not it's not part of it's not allowed it was illegal it was illegal yeah so this part of the story is is actually really interesting because the missing middle wasn't always missing so I'm in church Wellesley Village or just the village if you know the area and in the early 1900s there was an explosion of apartment buildings sort of like this one right here you know Toronto's population was booming First World War soldiers were coming back home immigrants were arriving and they were drawn to manufacturing jobs and this building actually so it's called The Royal George Apartments it was built in 1911 a year later in 1912 Toronto passed a law essentially Banning the construction of apartment buildings it was it was based on the belief that these you know sort of closely packed tenements were filthy and run down and sort of immoral and not fit for Toronto and you know of course wealthy homeowners didn't want those kinds of neighbors living on their street and Incredibly that thinking certainly in a legal sense stayed pretty deeply entrenched in Toronto for a long time and and prevailed for most of the last century okay let's get into a few examples here this here we can see how the property has been modified so in this case one of the proposals was converting a garage that perhaps is not in used into a residential Suite so it could accommodate you know your elderly parents or if your kids go to they want to leave the house but it's not an option rent is too expensive how can you create a secondary Suite it is the very bare minimum of the missing middle because this would fit your family needs perhaps but it want to meet the city's needs right there's a lot more than just my grandma that needs to find a place absolutely yeah I seriously think what about this I mean this is so a bigger unit in this case a garden Suite very similar is a laneway suite so the difference between a laneway suite and a garden Suite is just if you have a laneway or not but in 2019 the city approved the laneway suite pilot to allow a secondary Suite what are we looking at here I mean this this is a much bigger construction but it's starting to approach what we're actually talking about now we're getting into what we call the plexus so the plexus could be a Triplex a four Plex and eight Plex and this starts to solve the problem we're starting to get there I I'm not sure how much it would you know really move the needle in it for Toronto but if we're talking about Mississauga the Cambridge you know smaller municipalities that need to to take an active part right like the province has uh um they just announced specific targets for each of the municipalities this is definitely how they could and should meet the those targets and even this is sort of just a a small idea of how how Grand we can get with this vision of the missing middle because this is an actual project that you've worked on we we must have that discussion because there are some streets in our neighborhoods and think of in Toronto Christie Dufferin Lansdowne these are these streets are just as wide as Bloor College Dundas yet because of their language designation all they could have are those houses so if you walk along Dufferin Christie you just see houses the missing middle if you really wanted to make a change we need to perhaps upset the neighbors a little bit but we we have to do something that it will move the needle because if not we're just gonna stay with those cute apologies exactly that will be great for your grandmother but not really great for newcomers because if I was to ask you what is the single biggest hurdle to having more missing middle housing built in the city you would tell me what you know when the city approved the garden Suite A pilot I thought wow this is the harmless policy ever like how much can we talk about it they got so much opposition Appeals not in my backyard um and I thought wow this is really hard to get things done and that's just for a garden suite and that is for the garden exactly okay so Nama we're looking at two different land use maps one for Vancouver one for Toronto what should I be noticing about these well you tell me what is the most prominent color you see it's a lot of yellow yes exactly and the yellow is the lenius designation of neighborhoods what does that mean what kind of houses do you see there what kind of homes detached semi-detached townhouse no yeah and that's the vast I mean swaths of Vancouver and Toronto that's just what it looks like exactly I want to make sure I understand this so let's slide this off here right off the table we're going to make this really simple for me okay okay so let me dump these blocks out okay this we have a hundred blocks every block is one percent okay of the Cherry this this is Toronto and so the green I mean there's actually a fair bit of this city where the land use is designated as sort of Green Park space Open Spaces right so that's one section we have lots of other areas these are the sort of the darker colors and what do those mean this would be in this context of your blocks anything that is not residential or roads the blocks things that uh employment industrial uses are okay in those purple blocks okay then we're left with these we care about these people live here exactly exactly and so we have I guess apartment buildings sort of bigger bigger buildings exactly that we see all the time the old rental ones exactly like this one apartment buildings rental the ones that we refer to as rental mixed use so oh and it's so funny because when we talk about the affordability crisis this is exactly the reason scarcity of land now how many of these yellow are just single detached that are we start counting okay four is getting a lot of these seven this is eight okay this 31 percent single detached all of this just single detachments yes so how do we turn this into that so the discussion of the missing middle is actually not converting this to that we're not talking about high density like mid-rise or tall buildings where we will see in the Reds kind of this is near Transit this is in commercial streets we're just talking about taking this and turning it from a single right family to more families and the limit is the the city identified is four stories so it's almost like instead of having all of these single blocks if you'd start doing a little something this this is our City more beautiful and more welcoming and there's a vision that we need to start stepping towards and we need to make those decisions and we need everyone on board in here are some very common concerns complaints about missing middle housing and I'd like for you to draw from the pile you have no idea what's in here but I think you're well equipped to handle it okay [Music] thank you hey uh welcome back to about that we are talking about missing middle housing in this country and and so you you know when I use that term I mean you know any kind of housing where you can fit more people in that then you could fit in a single family home for example but something that isn't a gargantuan condo Tower because when you look at you know a city like Toronto where almost a third of its space is used pretty inefficiently right like Zone single-family homes big chunks of of the city and lots of cities across the country maybe there's a better way so what we're about to do here we're going to bring Travis Hanks into the conversation uh Travis you're a principal architect with hexity this is a an architectural firm in Vancouver and we're going to talk about a project that you've been working to get off the ground for a little while that that correct me if I'm wrong it manages to fit 13 units into a single residential lot is that right that's right there 13 total units it is an oversized lot it's not a standard lot and we've got a video that that you folks have provided for us so this is uh part of Vancouver and this is what it could look like the major move that that we've made that we've been advocating for is a courtyard psychology so there's actually two primary buildings on the site one that's pushed a little closer to the street than you might see uh you know in previous developments here um and one that's on the laneway in the back and what that allows is to have you know pretty substantial green space in the middle you get lots more light into all of those units and you have a great social space right at the heart of the project that brings all the neighbors together hi my name is Shirley Shen and I'm an architect at hexy Studio architecture I want to tell you about how long this project is going to take from beginning to end this project actually started in 2015 when a different architect was exploring a low-rise apartment for the site this project was shelved in 2016 because the site simply could not support the parking that was required in 2019 parking regulations were reduced for rental housing and so that's when conversations were restarted it took a year to confirm with the city the underground parking was not required for a rental project on the site we were brought on board in 2021 to develop a missing middle type project with only surface parking we were able to get through the pre-application process in only a year and we were able to submit our rezone application in 2022 the reasoning approvals will take about a year and after that we still have to get a development permit and a building permit and if all goes well we'll start construction in 2026 and people might be able to move in in 2027 or 2028 so as you can see the project timeline is measured in years not months and our involvement will have total of seven years for the developer they would have spent about 12 years working on the project this is a timeline that is appropriate for a high density high-rise project definitely not for a small scale missing middle type project and that is why you don't see very much missing metal projects being built in Vancouver today now there is one interesting thing about how some in Vancouver want to tackle housing density and create more of it so there's this thing called the floor space ratio or the FSR and you can think of it as how much total square footage you're allowed compared to the size of the lot so you know let's say you've got a 4 000 square foot lot which is you know pretty typical and FSR of 0.7 would mean your total square footage like your total living space could be 70 of the lot or 2 800 square feet for single detached homes that actually is the max limit by law for multiplexes the FSR is 1.0 which means on that same lot you could build like this or like this or like this you get the idea but some say that's still too small like if you want to get serious really serious about density you need to set the FSR at like 1.5 or even 2.0 which might look like this or this or this the result more units on the same lot which in theory makes them more affordable okay so Nama we wanted to address some of the concerns that some people might have about this idea of building this kind of you know missing middle housing in their neighborhood can you just wait here just one second I have something okay this um think of this as like the uh about that complaint box [Laughter] in here are some very common concerns complaints about missing middle housing and I'd like for you to draw from the pile you haven't seen these before clearly no you have no idea what's in here but I think you're well equipped to handle it okay go ahead and pull from the start right from the beginning higher density developments will reduce property values in my area I love that okay we started with the classic one so developments whatever they are small or or large they actually tend to improve the environment that they're coming in we have as part of our planning process when you get let's you're a developer and you're getting a building approved we have in the mechanism built into the process things that you need to contribute it's called Community benefits it's called Parkland dedication to ensure that development actually improves our city you want to take another complaint okay developers care only about the money and not for the true needs of my community I would say you would be surprised by how many of them are willing to come to the table and listen and Implement ideas that are coming from the community into their projects and it's okay that they care about the bottom line because if the bottom line will be negative it won't be built as simple as that and if we want more housing being built I would love to see more and more communities discussing and having a fruitful dialogue with developers about the things that matter like public Improvement and what their Community can can get done try this one the Shadows of the building will block my sunlight I would say that I have a problem that you know we prioritize backyards over someone a place to call home because this is our planning system we're saying okay let's protect your backyard From Shadows and in the process we'll just cut 30 units of the of the new developments so not in the context of the missing middle because come on guys this is a four-story height of the house but definitely we need to address the elephant in the room right you're saying that even if this argument applied to the missing middle which it doesn't because the buildings just aren't tall enough to cast those kinds of Shadows high as a house you're saying even if it I mean it's just are we really prioritizing shadows two more okay I'm worried about the impact to existing Services infrastructure and environment okay I love this one because now it's like it's not them it's the pipes it's this the sewage pipes that can handle new people right and I the answer for that and I hear that a lot almost every open house I hear that one we need to remember that the this discussion is the purely professional discussion with the engineering department and there are many steps in the process that these arguments are being reviewed and being discussed and being changed and development pays for for upgrades so and I never heard of any project that the engineering department recommended against it but cancel approved it anyway it doesn't happen but the concern is real right if people are worried about parking spaces if people are worried about you know the park capacity near them in their local neighborhood schools I mean whatever right one of the advantages of density okay building inwards and upwards means that we have more space left as open space right and the opposite of it is building more and sprawling out and consuming more land and so if anyone is concerned about open space they should be actually Pro density not against it this has been fascinating thanks so much for doing it thank you for having me foreign [Music] hey welcome back to about that so here's the thing about the missing middle you know depending on where you sit the idea of cramming 13 units into a single residential lot you know may sound like a wonderfully Progressive idea or the worst kind of neighborhood nightmare but what is certainly true is that even its most passionate proponents don't see the missing middle as a cure-all solution to this country's housing crisis because you know making home ownership more affordable again it's just going to take a hell of a lot more than what the missing middle can provide but you know think of it this way like like the thin edge of a wedge you know a way to introduce density into communities where that word density is is like Kryptonite it's like a way to to ease the transition from single-family home neighborhoods to something with a little more density built in all the way up to dense you know City cores with big tall buildings in a way having an in-between depolarizes the conversation and that Advocates say is worth fighting for I'm Andrew Chang thanks for watching take care [Music]

#ABCNews #ABCNewsAustralia",2,[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Gabrielle hit the hit Valley in New Zealand's Hawkes Bay Region we're just trying to get as much stuff out as we could you know just trying to salvage what we can inside the house you know there's not much you can really get out of this Max and his father Hector were asleep when the flood arrived in the early hours of the morning woke up yeah it was about just over ankle deep in my room so then I ran down and got dead up and then rang my ankle next door and told him to get his stuff together I was swimming back to the house the plan was to get in the truck and get out of here but at that stage the water was above the windscreens and their dogs sought shelter next door where Max's uncle lives his uncle shot this video as they waited out the storm on the second floor meanwhile Max was at his other neighbor's house where they ended up on the roof for hours the first days we were getting on the roof heard a lady come past screaming had no idea where she was or what happened as soon as we got some form of light I managed to see your hands holding on to something once the water was at a you know at least I thought I could get in there and help her I'd swam across and got her she was 70. she was like blue so I took my clothes off and just cut her as warm as possible and then just wrapped her up so this is a big pie plate of red intense heavy tropical rain tropical Cyclone Gabrielle was one of the worst storms to hit New Zealand in living memory the east coast of the North Island was the worst hit with the Beachside city of Napier recording its second wettest day since records began in the 1950s 2023 has the potential to be a very difficult year for many kiwis prime minister Chris Hipkins has said the cleanup bill is likely to be in the billions there's hundreds of kilometers of State Highway to be repaired and some communities are still isolated firefighters including an Australian crew are now methodically combing through properties where people are unaccounted for having lived in in Hastings all of my life I've never seen anything like it the wind was terrifying and not being able to get out of my driveway in the early hours of the morning to sign the state of emergency we had to climb over trees and it was huge so this is the well the hallway I suppose awake on the scenes inside Max's house are astonishing it was up to here and this is quite a high roof house as well our ceiling um there's more than a meter of silt and mud beneath our feet you still sink into it in some spots this is a little self-contained unit in here for my dad um he's just his lounge and stuff and through there's this bedroom in his bathroom now this is uh my new back door Welcome to our home thank you come on true this is the entry down the road somehow the flood hasn't destroyed ra Cooper's warm Hospitality so obviously um at your heart feels like it's ripped out looking at the condition it is now ra her fiance Maggie and their dog were rescued by a neighbor because I've run out of energy to try and swim out Ben saved Our Lives we couldn't have ever done it on our own right up to there and the same inside yes yeah so that's why I said if you think of us and me yeah I was a corner he floated us across to on the blue City and pushed us over on his reef and another guy pulled us over the back bench to safety how fortunate was that that was awesome here you can see some signs of progress destroyed belongings and mud have been cleared out of people's homes and some houses are starting to look a little bit like they might have before the flood but you only have to go about a kilometer down the road and where do you even start foreign the future of some of these communities is now very uncertain we know what's happening with the the impacts climate change and we have to adapt we have to find other ways we have started three years ago a hastings-based housing plan where people will live in urban areas and away from some of our most vulnerable areas of waterways of the ocean and it's a big hard question for our communities to Grapple with but we it's a conversation we need to have despite it all Max Robertson wants to rebuild if he can I'd probably still live here I'd still build here um people probably say I'm crazy but you know this this house survived the earthquake bowler it's it's a freak storm while complete strangers are helping her clean up her home ra Cooper provides an incredible positivity that keeps everyone going we're quite humble by the community's support but our house is repairable and we're still together with Rusty outdoor and that's amazing

And if you're watching this on YouTube from somewhere else, we're based in Northern California. But I wanna start with Southern California. And the reason why I want to do that is because what we're going through here in California is this grand unifying moment. If you're not aware, there's a little bit of rivalry between Southern California and Northern California when it comes to weather, when it comes to water, when it comes to all sorts of things. But this is the one moment when we're all sort of sharing the same. Experience together, which is a very cold storm coming in. It's got rain, it's got snow. But really the star of the show is how low the snow is gonna be over the next few days. In fact just yesterday, this is where I grew up, this is in Southern California, a place called Alta Loma. It's right around 2000 feet snow falling on the foothills and just behind that is a soon to be maybe famous place called Mount Baldy, which could get upwards of 678 feet of snow in the coming days. So that's going to be a very rare. Event for Southern California. My dad sent me this, so this is what we're focused on here in Northern California is a huge snowstorm that's going to produce plenty of snow up high and really light dry, fluffy snow that skiers love. But the low snow goes all the way down to 1500 feet and even lower than that where we're going to get more snow than we typically do. Usually it's a dusting or maybe an inch of snow down to those places. We could be getting 3-4, maybe even 5 inches of snow up to about 2000 feet. So this is going to be a bigger deal and also everybody. In between, there's many communities that that are there that are going to be very much challenged by what's gonna happen because this is a lot of snow for those areas and it's cold afterwards keeping that snow there. There's not a whole plowing system like you have in Truckee or South Lake Tahoe. So the infrastructure and just getting around is going to be very difficult. With that said, we're going to get many feet up high and like I mentioned, right around a foot between 1000 feet and 4000 feet. The higher numbers of course higher in elevation, but the middle of the valley, we're going to have to keep an eye on that. Because we're going to be challenged at some moments where we could be getting either snow or groppel or different things that are are are very unusual to about 500 feet if not lower. So some of these communities could actually get a few flakes thrown in with some rain in the coming days. These are all right around 500 feet to 1000 feet. So again, just based on impacts, this is what I'm thinking that today and tomorrow, which is Thursday and Friday, 0 feet to 500 feet, we might get some flurries, we might get. And grapple we might get something mixed in there and I say 0 because for far down in California at the beach, if places like Ferndale or Cal Poly Humboldt, we have seen some snow in those areas. As far as the biggest impact, I think it's going to be between one and 5000 feet. A lot of snow for those areas could lose power with strong winds. And then above 5000 feet those communities are more or less used to snow. But even for them this is a lot of snow that's going to have power outages potentially with strong winds, low visibility, lots of chain. Controls and lots of closed roads at times because of visibility, just too much snow. Over the last 24 hours, we saw the system come together. But what it's really lacking is a lot of the deeper moisture that's going to be moving in later on today. This is as of 9:45 in the morning. We've got temperatures in the 40s down low and that sort of magic middle there. Once you get to the mid 30s or below, that's when you really start to see the snow levels creep in. So this is again from earlier in the morning, but you can see that it's Northern California, it's Southern California. Some major roads like I5, the Grapevine, which is one of the main roads from Northern California to Southern California, it might have to close because they have a very rare if ever issued Blizzard warning for these mountains from the National Weather Service. That's mostly through Friday and early Saturday, several feet of snow and gusts up to 65 to 70 mph, so you just can't see and there's lots of drifting snow. So again, that's when I think that that road is going to be closed and then just focusing again on more. More of Southern California roughly in this area here is Mount Baldy, which could get well over 80 inches of snow within 24 hours. So it's going to be wild. We're getting snow in the mountains near Santa Barbara. We're getting all sorts of things, and then also lots of heavy snow. On I-8, this is between San Diego and Yuma. They're getting heavy snow. It's a beautiful area with boulders, but it also is getting snow and they rarely see that in the mountains between the in the coastal range, between Santa Cruz and the Bay Area. Lots of snow there as well. So as we spread things out, what we're seeing is something very unusual. Snow in the mountains, sure, but almost all the way down to the beach, and in some cases it is falling at sea level. Now the core of this is really what we have to keep an eye on, because until this guy is well and truly clear of our area, it's just going to keep pumping in more moisture, more cold air and more chances for rain and for snow. So for places like Sacramento, it's going to be a cold day with wind, but what we're looking at is things starting to creep in later on in the day. And just to show you how this comes together, very spotty through much of the day, hit and miss showers for rain, snow to 2000 feet, even lower a little bit. But in the middle of the night we really ramp things up because that's when the main band moves through. We're talking about Valley rain, Sierra Snow and 3:00 o'clock in the morning, it's going to tank. It's going to go to 1000 feet if not lower. So as folks are waking up early on Friday morning, that's when you're going to see the lowest snow potential. Just so we're clear again, there's that low as it marches down the coast. The reason why Baldy could get so many feet of snow is because it stalls out, pumping in moisture on top of cold air, and don't sleep on what happens afterwards. Saturday is a bit of a lull, but we've got more coming in Sunday, Monday and Tuesday with several more feet of snow, several inches of rain, and just extending this cold system where we get rain, snow, low snow and very active weather for the next four or five days after that, looks like we're going to catch a bit of a break, but we might even see more rain coming back of course, next weekend."
wYyft5EsxZM,Cars remain abandoned along I-84 in Portland,"ODOT said they've called in crews from Central Oregon to help clean up the abandoned cars. They were cleared out by Thursday afternoon, though vehicles remained stalled on I-205 over the Glenn Jackson Bridge.

Crews are out using salt, deicer and sand and also plows to try and clear things up after a rough 24 hours. The Portland, Vancouver area is digging out after heavy snowfall created chaos on the roads. Dozens of cars are still littered along the side of the freeway. They were abandoned by drivers after being stuck in traffic for hours across the entire region. Rd. crews worked to get highways moving again, but in many places there were still long delays. This stretch of Interstate 5 between Vancouver and Portland was at a standstill all morning. The road conditions are treacherous. You gotta be careful. One of the biggest trouble spots was the I5 ramp to I-84 E near the Lloyd District. A pair of semis were wedged together on this narrow, icy ramp. Traffic didn't move all night. So you've been here since? And here's since 12:30. In the morning, yes, truckers admit the treacherous conditions caught them off guard. What's ultimately the issue here? Nobody was prepared for and backups were compounded by drivers who abandoned their cars. And that is not one thing. Is all others in there with it? One right after the next, the perfect storm, as they say. Yeah, perfect storm. But for many, the biggest issue was ODOT. They argue the state agency responsible for Oregon highways was slow to respond. You know, in different states, they're they're a little bit more coordinated. On Wednesday night, in the thick of the storm, most Portland area freeways came to a standstill. KGW's Catherine Cook was stuck in traffic along I-5 for more than 7 hours. My photographer and I could definitely use a bathroom break, maybe a good stretch, and some food. With traffic snarled and no snow plow, Sanders or gravel trucks insight many drivers complained ODOT was to blame. If there was anybody on I 58425 that had any kind of life threatening emergency, they probably would have died. There was no getting through that traffic at all. What do you say to those folks? Could O dot have done better? We were hoping to do better than we did on that. We are down in staff right now. We can't get the roads cleared as quickly as we hope to because we're not at full staff, ODOT spokesperson Don Hamilton explained. The storm moved fast and crews. Couldn't clear freeways. They were already clogged with stalled cars and semis. Mother Nature hits us hard sometimes and we go with the tools as best we can and sometimes from other nature wins, and in this case, Mother Nature won. Hamilton says crews worked overnight to clear the roads, but with this much snow and ice in freezing temperatures, it will take time to get freeways back up to speed. Back here live on I-405, you can see the freeway actually looks pretty good here now it really is hit and miss around town. There are other spots that are very slick at this point. The Sun certainly has helped to clear some of this snow and ice away. Also worth mentioning, ODOT brought in crews and equipment from Central Oregon to help with the issues here in the Portland metropolitan area."
