This is split up into the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras, so let's hit these eras one at a time, since so much happened in each one. First up, the Paleozoic era!

of Earth’s history at the end of the Proterozoic eon, and the Cambrian explosion. The first era of the Phanerozoic Eon is the
Paleozoic Era, which lasted from 541 to 252 million years ago. It was a time of great change, and many new
types of organisms evolved during the Paleozoic. The Burgess shale provides a detailed look
into the strange creatures of the time, like Hallucigenia. Nature experimented with a wide variety of
different body designs during the Cambrian, many of which went extinct. A factor that influenced the rapid radiation
of animals was the lack of predators during and immediately after animals first evolved,
which allowed for large populations since they were not hindered by predation. Life began in the oceans, and by the Early
Phanerozoic, was beginning to invade the barren lands, pioneered by the first vascular plants,
which were later followed by lungfish and other creatures looking for new food sources. The colonization of land by vascular plants
had a large impact on the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, which cooled the
Earth so much that it caused a mass extinction event. Land plants laid the foundation for brand
new ecosystems, as other organisms moved into forests looking for food and shelter, the
most consequential being a population of lungfish that evolved leg-like fins. These new animals, amphibians, were the first
vertebrates to walk on land. All vertebrates, from dinosaurs to humans,
share a common ancestor with amphibians. Before long, the land was colonized by amphibians,
which evolved into reptiles near the end of the Paleozoic. The main innovation that marks the evolution
of amphibians to reptiles was the rise of the amniote egg. It allowed reptiles to reproduce on dry land,
whereas amphibians must return to water for this part of their life cycle. The Paleozoic was a time of great mountain
building along Eastern North America. North America collided with three separate
land masses, causing three separate orogenies, or mountain building events. The first orogeny is called the Taconic Orogeny,
occurring 450 million years ago. The second is called the Acadian Orogeny,
at 380 million. And the third and final orogeny, called the
Alleghanian Orogeny, occurred 300 million years ago and was responsible for forming
the Appalachian Mountains. These mountains were around the size of the
Himalayas when they first formed and have extensively eroded over the past 300 million
years, leaving behind the resistant stumps of a once great mountain range. The Alleghanian orogeny concluded with the
assembly of the supercontinent Pangea at the end of the Paleozoic. An important geologic period toward the end
of the Paleozoic Era is called the Carboniferous Period. A geologic period is a more specific classification
of geologic time compared to an era. The Carboniferous Period is named for the
large deposits of coal that were formed during this time, deposits that span the entire globe. Coal forms when plant tissues are rapidly
buried in anoxic conditions in coastal and inland swamps. Rapid burial of organic material requires
rapid fluctuations in sea level, which are caused by the formation and melting of glaciers,
so without Carboniferous glaciers, the Industrial Revolution may not have occurred! In summary, the Paleozoic Era was a time of
dramatic transformation, for both the Earth and its inhabitants, so it seems only fitting
that the era would go out with a bang. Let’s move forward and find out precisely
what happened to prompt the next era of the Phanerozoic Eon."

"Introduction to President Jokowi at Ratas Mudik Lebaran 2023, Merak Port, Cilegon, 11 April 2023",,2023-04-11T05:57:58Z,UC_m_NBgf7ieJBHzb6vvJC5A,News & Politics,276,80468,1736,0,174,2023-11-07T09:40:40.998000,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ib798fa28xA/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,ib798fa28xA,"Ladies and gentlemen, all of you saw last year's homecoming, there were records that we had to correct and the big records were at Merak Harbor and also on the toll road. Therefore, those working in the field in detail must really look at it so that it can be repaired.  from management last year, the homecoming flow must be better and I really appreciate what has been done at Merak Port, so it is conveyed that there is an addition to Pier 2 Port and there is also a quite significant increase in capacity from 34 thousand to 49,000, a quite large jump in numbers.  because we know that 86,000 people will be returning home this year, this year it is estimated from the survey results that there will be 123 million from 86 million to 123 million. Therefore, additional capacity and additional docks are very important and earlier I also saw that the management is very detailed about which ports used for heavy vehicles, which port is used for motorized vehicles and which port is used for small and large vehicles, the management method is very good, but later we will see what the management is like in the field, because if we remember last year, there was a big problem in upper power and lower power side. Are the improvements we have made really able to eliminate the problems that have occurred in the last year? Then secondly, apart from Merak, it is also related to toll roads and looking at the number of rest areas which in the last year were very disturbing, the number has also been increased.  and we hope that in addition to the Ministry of Transportation, the National Police, the TNI will ask the BUMN to ask the governor, regent, mayor, to really go down to see the problem in detail so that they can execute it directly in the field because I can't imagine jumping from 86 million to 123 million, that's not management.  which is easy, requires preparation, requires good planning design and is very hopeful. Why am I here? I want to ensure that everything we hope will go well and the community will really serve it well, no one will feel like they are hanging around on the road for a long time at the port  there's a traffic jam that's what I think we expect. I think that's an introduction, thank you"

Here are the 6 provinces in Indonesia that have moved their capitals [Music] The first province to do so.  once moved its capital to the Riau province. This province was a fraction of the province of Central Sumatra. At the beginning of its formation, the provincial capital was located in Tanjung Pinang because its territory at that time also included the Riau Islands. 7 months after it was declared as the Riau province, the capital was then moved from Tanjung Pinang to Pekanbaru [Music] then the next province that had moved its capital was the province of Central Kalimantan. This province was the result of the expansion of the Province of South Kalimantan at the beginning of its formation, although the capital was set in Palangkaraya, but for a while the place and occupation of the government was in Banjarmasin until one and a half years later the place and position of government of the province Central Kalimantan was moved to Palangkaraya. The next province that moved its capital was the province of West Sumatra along with Riau and Jambi. This province was a fraction of the province of Central Sumatra. At the beginning of its formation, the capital of this province was Bukittinggi, but in reality the center of government activities was in Padang so as to increase efficiency and the effectiveness of government administration and development implementation as well as to create a stable government administration order, it was only 21 years after its formation that the provincial capital was officially moved from Bukittinggi to Padang through government regulation number 29 of 1979. The next province that moved its capital was the province of Bali, a province which is a fraction of the province.  At the beginning of its formation, Nusa Tenggara had its capital in Singaraja. However, two years later, in 1960, its capital was moved to Denpasar, then the next province that moved its capital was the province of North Maluku. This province was the result of the expansion of the Maluku province in 1999 with its capital being Sofifi, but since its formation the place  and the seat of the North Maluku provincial government was temporarily in Ternate City because it had not yet been built and there was a lack of infrastructure in Sofifi at that time until in 2010 the government officially moved the capital of North Maluku from Ternate City to Sofifi and the latest province to move its capital was the province of Kalimantan  In South Kalimantan, officially in 2022 the provincial capital of South Kalimantan will be moved from the city of Banjarmasin to the city of Banjarbaru. The determination of Banjarbaru City as the capital of South Kalimantan is expected to have an impact on regional progress considering the plan to move the state capital to East Kalimantan so that Banjarbaru is expected to become a buffer area in the South Kalimantan region. Banjarmasin is planned to be organized as a trade center including river tourism to support the nation's capital, while Banjarbaru will be designated because the area is wider, that is the provinces in Indonesia that have moved their capitals. Hopefully this will be useful and add further insight to our discussion in the comments column. Thank you."

Well, that's very beneficial for motorists who drive a car. So far, we have prepared this, so it's very ready and God willing, it will run smoothly because 2 ports are open too. In my opinion, make sure you get it. This surge means people have to go home, so that's why the two ports were opened to clear them up so there won't be any serious traffic jams. My hope is that every year it will increase, it will be even better, so every time there is a homecoming for Eid or something else there won't be any traffic jams.  again [Music]"

Lucky Hakim has uploaded a video via his Instagram account. Lucky admits that he is not embarrassed if he is considered a crybaby and then resigns. This will be bad for me. I know. Maybe I will be considered weak or something, but for me it's okay. In fact, the official should cry and cry with shame if, for example, the official doesn't work properly if we are paid by the people's money. The people's money is a trust in the Hereafter.  It's difficult for people to earn money. Regent of Indramayu, Nina Agustina, said that she appreciates and respects Lucky Hakim's decision to resign because it is her personal right.

I think it's possible or not, I think that's the same. I've heard the benefits of this. Maybe it's all safe, it's safe. Can I say what's unique about all four of them? The height of their voice is their range and it's also different, yes, some are a bit low, some are higher than one another, so in the end, if you look at the song in terms of the basic notes, they are different, so I adjust them at the bottom, then I make a transition between the basic notes and the other basic notes, modulation, in music the term is so because I  I want to adapt them so that they can sing the prayers comfortably, not think about it. No. I want them to be with their own characters in those places. Well, I've continued to adjust the accompaniment like that, and the matter of getting to know them is very unique because two of them are blind.  Yes, but I'm really amazed at how many times during the process, I don't know, in this project, in general, how many times have I teared up, I can't stand it, I've cried too, that's all from the time I made the arrangements, night until dawn, I stayed up late working on this and meeting these children.  I got to know them and I joked with them, I was very happy and I was touched to see what they were, their intelligence was extraordinary and what they were, they were always cheerful, they were just getting to know each other, but they could be friends, the jokes between them were so touching, it was so touching to hang out with them, Mas Adi, I was very happy  Hear the behind the story about the preparation for this truly heart-warming orchestration. Once again, thank you for providing such a beautiful work for all of us. Hopefully you can catch up on your rest after this and once again thank you for sharing your story in other news.

In Indonesia, most of them are followers of the Jo religion, while followers of Taoism are not. On the other hand, in the world, the number of adherents of the religion or Isma is actually more, namely 74 million people, while Confucianism is only six million people, friends, these figures and data are 7 differences between the Confucian religion and Taoism, religions that are almost similar because both come from China. However, it turns out The difference is that one view of humans, the Confucian religion views that humans must use their strength to help promote the necessary virtues such as the virtues of justice, unity and loyalty, while the monotheistic religion views that humans must use their minds well to help create peace as in the principles of Yin and  Yang G2: the system of power in the Confucian religion, the system of power tends to be based on family hereditary dynasties, while the Tofu Wisma religion tends to be more democratic without being tied to family. Three differences in discussion. Hai Confucian religion tends to discuss harmony or relationships between humans, while the Tofu Isma religion tends to discuss divine theology. 4 differences.  basis [Music] Hi, the Isma religion is the majority in Taiwan, namely 44 percent of the population, while the Confucian religion is not the majority in any country, including China, where the majority of Chinese are atheists, namely 74 percent of the population. Meanwhile, the original Chinese traditional belief that is most widely adhered to is  tawis Ma where four percent of the population while Confucianism is only about three percent of the Chinese population 5 views of reincarnation Hi monotheistic religion Mama believes that humans are automatically reincarnated as humans again whereas in the Confucian religion reincarnation does not happen automatically but completely by God's will Hi different views and  the place of worship hai hai in the place of worship of the Confucian religion is called litang while the tofu Isma religion is called the tofu temple. The temples are places of worship of the Tridarma or three religions at once, namely the Confucian religion, the monotheism religion Medan Buddhism 7 Differences in carriers of the Confucian religion brought by the Confucian prophet around  551 BC, while Mata Wisma was brought by the philosopher Lautse around 600 BC, older than the Confucian religion, friends, numbers and data, those are the 7 basic differences between the two major traditional Chinese belief schools, namely Confucianism and Taoism.

rice sticks that are super soft and fail-proof, so this time I want to tell you about the
process of making sticky rice tape. Let's look at the video. First of all, prepare ½ liter of white sticky rice and ½ liter of black sticky rice,
then wash it until clean, oh yes, I  Mix these two sticky rices so that
the results are better, especially in terms of color, because if we use all black sticky rice,
I think the results will be darker after washing, we immediately
transfer it to a larger container then soak the sticky rice in tap water
and let it sit for about 2 while waiting, let's dry
the yeast first, OK? I use 1 round yeast
like this. After 2 hours, discard the
water soaking in the sticky rice and wait for
½ hour until the water is completely drained. Next step, put all the
sticky rice into a langseng or pan. Oh yes, if  I use a white net like this so it doesn't stick
and it's easy to lift it later, then we steam it until it smokes like this, open the lid of the pan, then lift it and transfer it
to a basket or other container, stir all the sticky rice, then flush the top
using clean water like this, then turn it over.  until the
bottom of the rice moves to the top, flush again the part that has not been exposed to water. You can also water the rice while
stirring it so that the results are really even. If all parts have been exposed to water, we will immediately drain it
first for about 1 hour. After that, stir the sticky rice once again until it is
evenly distributed.  there are no lumps then transfer it to the langseng
and steam it a second time before the sticky rice cooks. We prepare
first a flat container or tray like this then line it with banana leaves
until all parts of the container are covered after the sticky rice is smoking like this next lift it and transfer it to the same container
we have already prepared it, smooth it on all sides so that
all the hot steam can come out while waiting for the sticky rice to cool,
we take the yeast from earlier, OK, for drying the yeast,
do this for at least 3 hours. This is so that the tape
doesn't smell musty and the results are better, crush the yeast thoroughly.  smooth,
then set aside after the sticky rice has been left
for a few hours and it really isn't hot,
we can do the fermentation process first, sprinkle the yeast on the base
or bottom of the container, then place the
first layer of sticky rice like this, then sprinkle the yeast again evenly on top, then place the next layer then  add yeast again and so on until all
layers of sticky rice are covered with yeast. If you have finished all, prepare 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar then sprinkle it all over the
top layer evenly, then cover it with
banana leaves until it is really tight, cover it again with a cloth
or veil like this, finally wrap it around  Rapia rope several times
until it is really tight, then tie the rope. Pull the bottom of the veil
like this to ensure that there are no gaps at all so that the
fermentation process goes well after leaving it for approximately 3.5 days.
Now let's see the results. Open the Rapia rope and other coverings. Well, here we go.  he tapes the
sticky rice, wow, there's a lot of tape and the results are very sweet,
really suitable for dipping directly into sticky rice, here's the recipe for super sweet sticky rice tape,
good luck trying it at home and I hope it's useful"

There were many Hindu or Buddhist kingdoms in Indonesia, one of which was the Medang kingdom of the Syailendra dynasty which ruled in the Central Java region around the 8th century.  Medang was led by King Samaratungga, he had the desire to build a large cultural temple. He then told his people, O my people, I really want to make a place of worship for all of us. Are you willing to help me? Our king will gladly help you. Since then the construction of the Borobudur Temple began.  The temple was built using the people's labor who volunteered to help their king. They built the Borobudur Temple using stones arranged in steps. The construction of Borobudur took up to 100 years and was only completed in 850 AD. After the construction was completed, everyone can see clearly the form of the Borobudur temple which consists of 6  The square-shaped terrace on the walls of the temple has 2,627 relief panels and also 504 Buddha statues in it. In 929 AD Mount Merapi erupted so big that the Madang kingdom and its people decided to move to East Java and rebuild civilization there since moving to that area. Temple  Borobudur became neglected and began to be forgotten, as a result the abandoned temple was even thickly covered by the volcanic ash of Mount Merapi in 18 14. The British Governor who colonized Indonesia, Thomas Stamford Raffles, ordered his subordinates to carry out research in Java, namely Hermanus Christian Cornelis based on folklore, finally Cornelius  then found a large mound in the area where the Elo River and Progo River meet. Show what this looks like something important has been buried there. Then Cornelius reported the incident to Raffles and Raffles immediately asked him and his team to carry out excavations. After some time digging the mound, finally Hermanus  together with his team managed to find the Borobudur Temple which had been buried for hundreds of years. In 1971 the Indonesian government together with UNESCO carried out a large-scale rescue of the Borobudur temple, then UNESCO in 1991 declared the Borobudur Temple as a world heritage site [Music]"

Do you know what is meant by space? It is a place on the surface of the earth, either in whole or only in part, which is used by living creatures to live. Every space on the surface of the earth has certain characteristics that are different between  from one region to another, these distinctive characteristics can be in the form of soil, rocks, plants, etc., which are different from other places. The differences in spatial characteristics cause interactions between one space and another because each space requires another space to fulfill living needs, for example in mountainous areas.  generally produce vegetables, while coastal areas produce fish. Residents of coastal areas need vegetables from mountainous areas and conversely, residents of mountainous areas need fish from residents of coastal areas. The two regions then interact with each other. Through trade activities, according to Bintarto, interaction is a process that is reciprocal and has influence on behavior either through direct contact or indirect interaction can occur in the first form of human movement which is called population mobility, the second per khan of goods or energy is called transportation and the third is the transfer of ideas and information which is called communication. There are several interdependent conditions necessary for interactions between spaces occur, namely the first is complementary, the second is an opportunity between and the third is that conditions can be handed over or moved, the first is complementary conditions, complementary conditions occur if there are regions that produce different commodities, for example, region A is a vegetable producer while Region B is a Fish producers in Region A need fish, while Region B needs vegetables. If each has an advantage or surplus, then the region is considered not to interact with Region B. Hi. Through trading or buying and selling activities, the second condition is that the opportunity between the opportunity is a location that offers a better alternative. as a place of origin and destination, for example, regions usually buy fish from region B, but then it is discovered that there is a region that also produces fish. Because region C is closer and transportation costs are cheaper, fish buyers from the region will switch to buying fish to region C as a result of the interaction between region a with region B weakened thirdly ease of transfer ease of transfer and the costs required to transport goods or people are very dependent on the availability of infrastructure or facilities and Hi there are many who connect the origin and destination areas for example someone will sell vegetables from region a to region however  the road to Region B was damaged so it couldn't be passed as a result the person didn't sell vegetables to region B, well how delicious it is, it's clear how one region is interconnected with another region, we'll meet again at the next meeting.

Poor souls in the tombs of China's first emperors were part of the practice of burying the living together with the dead. The aim was so that they could care for the deceased in the afterlife known as grave sacrificial burial or renstring human burial this practice was found in most of the Chinese imperial dynasties for thousands of years this practice led to thousands of deaths both voluntary and forced according to dynasty scholars [Music] Huang died his son wuhai ordered to execute and bury all his father's concubines [Music] selected were the ones  never gave birth The reason was because it was not appropriate to let them leave the palace [Music] wrote suncahoe dilamar the world of Chinese all did not explain exactly How many people died on this order he noted that it was a large number besides the bones of the young woman the tomb worker also so Current victims of the 99 small tombs that archaeologists discovered inside the mongsoleum 10 have been excavated and all contain the bones of many young women thousands of construction workers who built the magnificent mozalio to rule the famous Alim were also victims of all noting that after the burial was completed the construction workers may reveal  what did they know about the inner workings of the mossolium inside? The museum contained abundant treasures and there were traps for grave robbers. Uhai's solution was to close the gates of the museum after the burial was over trapping all the workers inside. Historical records show that around 720,000 people worked in the mosoleum if  the records are all true, you can imagine how many victims died for the funeral of the first emperor. The practice of funeral sacrifices continues despite many contradictions. Senso Huang was not the first ruler nor was he the last to hold a funeral complete with sunsang. This practice is most famously associated with the Shang dynasty 1600-146 before  AD Um the late kings in hou chacong researchers found 164 skeletons in burial pits they were probably killed to accompany the dead kings in the afterlife for the Kings killed tens to hundreds of military Generals and civil officials killed from a few to 100 such practices  hampering people's lives and squandering countless wealth [Music] [Music]"

As for this leaked document, Samad suspected that it was not an investigation warrant.

But a complete document resembles the results of the investigation.

Where in the document, various strategies are included in the corruption and a number of substantial issues of corruption cases.

""There is a complete document in it that is actually the result of the investigation.So it's dangerous, ""Abraham Samad said.

""Therefore, law enforcement officials should not be playing games, because this is an extraordinary event in my opinion, it cannot be tolerated,"" he said again.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for KPK institutional action, Ali Fikri admitted, his party respected a number of parties who reported alleged ethical violations to Dewas.

According to him, according to his main task, the KPK Dewas will follow up the report professionally according to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and not be affected by any party.

"Why didn't PDIP enter the ""Jokowi Team""?","Metrotv, since the discourse of a large rolling coalition revolving the idea of Joko Widodo has often been associated as a central figure that provides agencies for the formation of a combination of the United Indonesia Coalition and the Indonesian Remanding Coalition.

It is possible if PDIP Perjuangan joins with a large coalition but since the discourse of this great coalition emerged PDI Perjuangan still appeared to be silent and even emerged the view of the Struggle would maneuver by carrying the presidential and vice presidential candidates themselves meaning the 2024 Presidential Election.

Indonesia is united and the coalition for the revival of Indonesia Raya has entered. Yes, by reading this we are joining Mr. Jokowi's team. In fact, Mr. Jokowi's command orchestra. The statements made by the two general chairs of political parties who are currently exploring the formation of a large coalition at least confirm Joko Widodo's true role in the 2024 presidential election.  It's like the orchestration of Joko Widodo as a central figure in the cross-breeding efforts between the United Indonesia coalition and the Greater Indonesia Awakening Coalition. So the question is whether Joko Widodo's political endorsement of the figure of the presidential candidate who will later be promoted by the big coalition will be successful in the 2024 presidential election so far since the direct election was held after  Pak SBY, then Pak Jokowi, previously Pak SBY, there had never been a signal that a president's direction would be able to win the next President because this was something new at that time. Pak SBY did not direct Indonesian citizens to vote for Pak Jokowi or Pak Prabowo, but Pak Jokowi apparently  are eager to direct this and the political parties are fighting for Jokowi's blessing. Definitely the grand coalition has not yet been declared officially formed, but in his meeting with Prabowo last weekend, the general chairman Panzulkiffi Ahsan claimed that Golkar and P3 as members of the united coalition had given their blessing and I came.  Also, what have you talked about with Mr. Erlangga and the Kaib? They are happy with the Kaib because of this friendship, eee, the meeting is between the leaders of political parties, moreover, it is still important, yes, those who are not the same can understand, especially if those who understand can be the same, that is also the case with Gerindra's general words. Prabowo Subianto hopes that with a large coalition, the harsh competition and differences in the presidential election will not be repeated with a spirit of togetherness, a spirit of kinship with us, whatever differences or tough competition there may be, but in the spirit of unity, no one has to win.  We have to lose, we don't all have to win. The formation of two axes in the next presidential election is possible. If the PDIP Perjuangan joins a large coalition, however, since the discourse on this large coalition emerged, the PDI Perjuangan still appears silent and there is even a view that the PDIP Perjuangan will maneuver by nominating its own presidential and vice presidential candidates, which means the 2024 presidential election.  It could be followed by 3 coalition axes, namely the grand coalition, the coalition for change for unity and the PDI Perjuangan Metro TV coverage team"

Political pressure is cruel.  politics and I have often experienced things like that. Ussy, usually at the time of Gus Dur, for example, I stepped down to give him the opportunity to become a presidential candidate. Remind me not to say yes because I resigned and then Gus Dur was elected as president and fell, even preached to me for a moment, okay?  my bow cabin was replaced hi finished Dur also sad thought you this first I forgot to subscribe there is a chance to run for president quadratic section led eh you in this way yes so will SBY make sure the three of us meet at the festival if I am we nominate SBY Democrat alone no one  they want to and even though it doesn't mean that without the PBB they can't nominate him. It's just that there are no Islamic groups that support only Democrats. The result is that with me it will be a democracy. One day I want to invite and respect seniors. How to join us bygrave Dapur, please join so we are the if I  signing the candidacy, what is it called bios like president, don't take the time to just get elected in Manchester, not long after that, I was dismissed, I think this politics is indeed cruel, at this point there is no sincerity, Budi, so the name is, I already understand this, okay?

The village of his friends was abandoned and the milk at that time was nominated by our party who fought it out in the first round, so there were only two pairs left.  there are many opponents who have joined the MP3 police, not some of SBY, they are already like heroes who really defend, for example Andi Mallarangeng, well, one example of making it up is buried next to it, but when it is certain to win, the FPI spokesman is useless, we are confused about who this person is, right?  At first it was OK, but AC wanted to get angry about politics, which you yourself are also political, so I once said this, he said, you are going into politics, he said, it's like a fish entering a book, he said, meaning it's easy to get out, it's hard to get out, so once you get into the book, the fish is like that.  Yes, you can only take it out if you remove the marinade from the fish and then fry it in the processor"

"Nickel Mining Dispute: 'The above is mined, underwater full of mud' - BBC News Indonesia","Indonesia has the potential to be the largest nickel supplying country, because it holds the majority of world nickel reserves.

However, nickel mining activities actually harm residents.

Clove farmers in Wawonii Village, Konawe, Southeast Sulawesi, held a protest because their clove land was finished in the interests of the mine.

They said the company was still in dispute with residents, on the other hand, there were some residents who had given up their land to be bought by the company.

""I have aspired this clove land for my child to go to college, now my heart is destroyed,"" said Royani, a resident of Wawonii.

In addition to clove farmers, fishermen in Pomalaa, Southeast Sulawesi also felt disadvantaged.The coast where they are looking for fish is now polluted.Residents also have difficulty meeting their daily needs.

""The above has been mined, under the sea full of mud,"" said Asep Solihin, a resident of Pomalaa.""If the parents are difficult, how will their children be, with natural conditions like this?""

There is a lot going on here but you cannot see it because what we are going take a closer look at today is air and how air moves. And we are going use
this setup to give you a better idea of how wind works. So our setup is pretty
simple. I have a container of soil that I am heating up with these hot lights. I
have a container of ice water, and I have a nice clear tube connecting the two, and
believe it or not, the air is moving between these two containers. I just
cannot see it because I cannot see the air. Now to help us see the air we are going
use this really neat smoke stick that is going generate some very safe and
harmless smoke to let us see what is happening in the air. So let us jump in
to see if we can figure out how wind works. Now, through science we have
discovered that things heat up at different rates. What does that mean? 
As the land heats up it heats up the air above it and through science we have
discovered that when air heats up, it spreads out, it expands, and it becomes
lighter, and because it becomes lighter, it rises. So you cannot see it but I have
all of this air that is being heated up and rising. Now take a look over here. the
water is cold, and through science we have discovered that when air gets colder, it gets denser, it gets heavier, it compresses and that
means it sinks. So I have sinking cold air over here I have rising warm air
over here and as that warm air rises this sinking cold air sweeps in and
takes the spot of the rising warm air. so we actually have wind happening through
this tube but we cannot see it! Enter our smoke stick. Now we are going introduce
some smoke and see if we can watch how the air moves. so here we go.
Bring my smoke stick in, get this thing charged up and I am going put it
here and you should be able to see, yes! I actually have a small current of wind
moving through my tube. You can see the smoke just follow the wind current
through the tube and as it comes out over here it is rising. That is how wind
works! Now you might be thinking I was shooting the smoke through this tube and
that is what was making it move so I am going to reverse it. we are going try
shooting the smoke in this way and see which way the wind is blowing. so here
we go. Let us charge up our smoke stick, get it fired up. I am going to come in here and
try and shoot it. you are going see I cannot get it to go through the tube
because the air is moving through the tube in this direction and it is pushing
it out Even if I try shooting it in the tube
I am going against the wind and it is not working. So remember what is happening. the
warm air is rising. it is lighter. the cold air is sinking and it is sweeping in to
take the spot of the rising warm air and it is the wind current is going this way.
So let us see this one more time. Warm air rises, cold air sinks. It sweeps
in and takes the spot of the rising warm air and we have wind. and look at it move. So think about what we have just shown you.
We have shown you that when we heat things unevenly, that is what makes the air move. 
Think about that as our planet.  Our planet has different areas being heated unevenly. The sun is really hot around the equator and it is really cold around the
poles. Well that uneven heating of the earth
makes the air move. but also think about this. Our planet is spinning and that
spinning also helps make the air move. so really two things are responsible for
wind - the uneven heating and cooling of the earth, and the spinning of the earth
all help make that air move. And even when we cannot see it that air is moving
all around us. One more time... We have wind. If you want to learn more about wind or weather, check out our links in the video description. Science is so cool,
even when we cannot see it. Thanks for watching."

Where the tribe is, that's where we can find the menu. Halal food and mosque buildings. The Sukuh Wei have lived in China for hundreds of years, precisely during the reign of the Tang Dynasty. It is believed that this tribe was born from intermarriage between Silk Road traders and Chinese people who lived in the local area. The appearance of the Hai tribe is also recognized by the majority of  they wear Islamic attributes in their daily lives, the men wear white caps. While the women wear the hijab, they are also famous for their friendly character and smile [Music] based on their geographic location, the Hai tribe is concentrated in the Ningxia Hainan Fensu area with dancing high. To get to know them more closely, you can visit the village  Muslim Cake is located in a city at the tip of the Indonesian province. Just like in Indonesia, Ramadan in China is also full of traditions of breaking the fast together when the fasting month arrives. The Woi tribe usually breaks the fast with their family. This is considered a big event among the Woi tribe. Almost every house will be busy preparing for the event.  Buber's goal is none other than to gather and get closer to the family. My tribe also keeps a unique tradition calledmukamu where every year they will welcome Ramadhan with special dances and songs. Apart from that, they also like to share food with fellow Muslim residents even though it's not as lively as in Indonesia. Ramadan in mainland China is still felt, especially for Muslims, whose number is estimated to reach 1.3 million of China's total population. My tribe also has a special menu for breaking the fast. One of them is beef noodles or in Mandarin it is called beef borromean but what is served by the tribe.  Kowe is different from beef, in general, its beef has gone through a Chinese Muslim-style syar'i process. Halal restaurants owned by Woi tribe residents are usually always busy with visitors. Towards sunset, the legal waiter will welcome visitors with a warm greeting, yes, viewers. That's the picture of my tribe hugging.  Islam is China, look forward to the beauty of other Chinese Muslim cultures in the next episode [Music] hi hi hi hi Hi Ho"

Unlike other areas in Lombok, there are no Balinese ethnic villages in East Lombok, so the question arises why did this happen, hey hey actually before 1825-1830 there were lots of ethnic Balinese villages in East Lombok, even in some villages the rulers came from ethnic Behind the many ethnic Balinese in East Lombok cannot be separated from the existence of four Balinese ethnic kingdoms that once ruled in western Lombok. The 4 kingdoms are Karangasem, Sasak, Mataram, Pagutan and Pagesangan, each of which has its own territory according to the legacy of the Mataram chronicle quoted by HL then Ibrahim To yib in his book entitled the face of ancient Lombok, the reign of Karangasem Sasak included batupute , batuliang, Batujai, Batutulis and parts of western Lombok . got written records, but according to one of the heirs of Mataram, the power of Mataram covered parts of western, central and eastern Lombok, and it was even mentioned that it reached the Jereweh area of ​​Sumbawa Hai, as a result of the control of several villages, many representatives of these ethical Balinese kingdoms were stationed in several villages, for example In Dipo Gading, there is a Balinese ruler named Made Beloso, commemorated by age, there is a comma grade name in rumbuk, there is the name Gusti, comma not mangosteen, and so on, while the village of Balinese ethnicity, which is quite large in East Lombok, is in the swela rat area.

This Satra war involved the Sakra datuan with Karangasem Sasak. When literature was assisted by several villages in eastern Lombok, Karangasem Sasak also received assistance from Mataram pagutan and Pagesangan during the war this led to the expulsion of the Balinese ethnicity in eastern Lombok, including the Balinese in Suela . controlled at midnight and passed kokop Ed Hai but the plan was leaked to the ears of orang pegading under his leadership the pawnbroker preceded the Balinese by waiting for dikoko PD it was told that when the refugees from swela passed Koko PD there was an attack by ivory people many ethnic Balinese who dead because of the ambush. Meanwhile, the rest who were still alive were taken prisoner in other villages.

"Pan Meichen's ""I Love You with Heart"" MV Collection Edition","Pan Meichen's ""I once loved you with heart""
Lyric: Pan Meichen
Composition: Pan Meichen

I once loved you with my heart
Why don't you see your true feelings for me
I met you countless times in a dream
After waking up, where are you there?

No matter how time is missed
If this go, do you think of me
This feeling is no longer available in the future
Don't let this love be empty

You are always so indifferent
How lonely I am me
After many years, you and me are divided into things
I will keep you in life forever

Even now we can break the fast together. Oh God, I feel like it's all mixed up, because when we're inside like that, there are definitely times when we want to be free.  There must be sadness because we weren't in prison for 2 years, we were in prison for years, well, Mas Nanas and I are almost the same, right? The sentence is 9 years and 3 months. I'm 9 years and 9 months and both of them don't get it.  It can be completely like that, except before being released, right? So we have something in common, eee, if I say, over time, fate is like that. So I also feel that Mas Anas must, O Allah, miss him inside, but we have to be free and also to welcome those in front of the prison and welcome him.  the future is like that, right? But I'm sure that the problem will definitely be. God willing, Eee is an extraordinary figure and not only that, when his speech was released, it made me cry too, wasn't it because I honestly haven't seen a speech like that in years, even though it's true for  That's me and the problem is more with my bestie, you can see how there are so many people not only from the same party before but also from different parties, there are different organizations, there are new mass organizations, I know there are these mass organizations, but they come  It's not a short time to welcome, you know, 9 years 3 months, almost 10 years, but they have been faithfully waiting for the problem to come out. Yes, it's definitely because of the humble figure of Mas Anas, first of all, and the figure of Mas Anas, who perhaps in the past was very helpful, Mas the pineapple, right? If you help, that's right.  I don't choose people like that, so everyone is helped and everyone is looking for a solution and everything is like he said, it has become like a base, without looking at people who have wronged him and even people who have bullied him or tyrannized him, right?  Anas, yes, nature is working, how come Mbak Enji remains united? What I learned from Anas's time is to forgive, continue to seek justice, continue to search for the truth, but this is not to save the drums of war. There are more people who suspect that Mas Anas is leaving and maybe it could be a threat or many people are actually buying it. I will take revenge on anyone who commits criminalization according to Mas Anas's version. There is concern that from the perspective of an Angelina soundtrack. Could it be done if I rarely touch things, bro? Is that what you want to do? Isn't that because I I also want to assess that Mas Anas is more neutral in the sense that he is someone who has experienced an unpleasant journey, he was once at the top and then suddenly fell and that fall was accompanied by constant insults and insults, definitely after this.  The problem is that if you eat, you will definitely be bullied and you will also be insulted, that's normal, there are those who like it and those who don't like it. But according to Angelina's figure, Anas Urbaningrum would be better off returning to politics or what if I don't have the courage to advise you to do it? [Applause] What's more, from my side, I can only pray that the Mas Anas River will be truly guarded by Allah, so I can't say anything too grandiose, OK? Because I know Mas Anas' heart, like that, sometimes someone's purity is inside.  Even a place that is a little dark can look dark, but the engine continues to fight for the truth, continue to seek justice, right and never get angry with people who we feel have wronged us?"

How do ocean currents work? - Jennifer Verduin,"Dive into the science of ocean currents (including the Global Conveyor Belt current), and find out how climate change affects them.

--

In 1992, a cargo ship carrying bath toys got caught in a storm. Shipping containers washed overboard, and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks and other toys into the North Pacific. But they didn’t stick together -- the ducks have since washed up all over the world. How did this happen? Jennifer Verduin dives into the science of ocean currents.

got caught in a storm. Shipping containers washed overboard, and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks 
and other toys into the North Pacific. But they didn’t stick together. Quite the opposite– the ducks have since washed up 
all over the world, and researchers have used their paths to chart a better understanding
of ocean currents. Ocean currents are driven 
by a range of sources: the wind, tides, changes in water density, and the rotation of the Earth. The topography of the ocean floor 
and the shoreline modifies those motions, causing currents to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Ocean currents fall into 
two main categories: surface currents and deep ocean currents. Surface currents control the motion of the top 10 percent 
of the ocean’s water, while deep-ocean currents mobilize 
the other 90 percent. Though they have different causes, surface and deep ocean currents 
influence each other in an intricate dance that keeps 
the entire ocean moving. Near the shore, surface currents are driven 
by both the wind and tides, which draw water back and forth 
as the water level falls and rises. Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the 
major force behind surface currents. As wind blows over the ocean, it drags the top layers 
of water along with it. That moving water pulls on 
the layers underneath, and those pull on the ones beneath them. In fact, water as deep as 400 meters is still affected by the wind 
at the ocean’s surface. If you zoom out to look at the patterns 
of surface currents all over the earth, you’ll see that they form 
big loops called gyres, which travel clockwise 
in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise 
in the southern hemisphere. That’s because of the way 
the Earth’s rotation affects the wind patterns that
give rise to these currents. If the earth didn’t rotate, air and water would simply 
move back and forth between low pressure at the equator and high pressure at the poles. But as the earth spins, air moving from the equator to the 
North Pole is deflected eastward, and air moving back down 
is deflected westward. The mirror image happens 
in the southern hemisphere, so that the major streams of wind form loop-like patterns 
around the ocean basins. This is called the Coriolis Effect. The winds push the ocean beneath 
them into the same rotating gyres. And because water holds onto heat 
more effectively than air, these currents help redistribute 
warmth around the globe. Unlike surface currents, deep ocean currents are driven primarily 
by changes in the density of seawater. As water moves towards the North Pole, it gets colder. It also has a higher 
concentration of salt, because the ice crystals that form 
trap water while leaving salt behind. This cold, salty water is more dense, so it sinks, and warmer surface water takes its place, setting up a vertical current called 
thermohaline circulation. Thermohaline circulation of deep water 
and wind-driven surface currents combine to form a winding loop 
called the Global Conveyor Belt. As water moves from the depths of 
the ocean to the surface, it carries nutrients that nourish the 
microorganisms which form the base of many 
ocean food chains. The global conveyor belt is the
longest current in the world, snaking all around the globe. But it only moves a few 
centimeters per second. It could take a drop of water 
a thousand years to make the full trip. However, rising sea temperatures are 
causing the conveyor belt to seemingly slow down. Models show this causing havoc with 
weather systems on both sides of the Atlantic, and no one knows what would happen if it 
continues to slow or if it stopped altogether. The only way we’ll be able to forecast
correctly and prepare accordingly will be to continue to study currents 
and the powerful forces that shape them."

JAKARTA, KOMPAS.TV - Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto alluded to the amazement of other countries over his relationship with President Joko Widodo.

Because, according to Prabowo, other countries were confused when he joined the government.The reason, Prabowo had become Jokowi's rival in the 2019 Presidential Election.

Prabowo explained, the joining of two rivals in one government was difficult to occur in another country.Therefore, Prabowo considers that Indonesia is now an example for other countries.

"Javanese people lived in Vietnam, before this country is independent @jimsinfoid","#jimsinfoid #jawavietnam

As we know, Indonesian citizens have extraordinary distribution.Not only can it be found here, people of the Unitary Republic of Indonesia, are also found in places far away.For example Madagascar, Suriname, Natal Island, even in New Kaledonia.Why there can be Indonesians there, there are many causes, ranging from colonialism to wandering.

Still a matter of Indonesian people who are scattered everywhere, in Vietnam there are also our inherent brothers.They are Javanese, or more detailed Bawean, who settled there.To this day, it is unknown, how these Bawean people can get to neighboring countries.But certainly, they have been there for a long time, even before Vietnam independent.

Uniquely, the Bawean people who are here, still know their original culture, although the amount is not much.

As far as the information obtained, both documentary and print media, there is no certainty of the source, which informs, about when the first time, the Bawean tribe came to Vietnam.This information is only estimated, that the arrival of the Bawean community to Vietnam, began in the colonial era of the Dutch colonial era.

According to one of the oldest Bawean residents in Vietnam, the arrival of the Bawean community, has several reasons.One of their goals to come to Vietnam is, to work in the French government, which has power in Vietnam.The reason they did not return home, was because they did not have legal citizenship documents, or the interruption of family and relatives in the Bawean Islands, which were in East Java.

From the history of the information found, the Al Rahim Mosque was built by Bawean people, when Vietnam was colonized by French troops.At that time, the Bawean community referred to as boyan people, built the mosque from wood.Now most of the Bawean people live around the Al Rahim Ho Chi Minh City Mosque.According to information from Imam Haji Ally, a leader of takmir mosque, Al Rahim Mosque has been established since 1885.

Most of the Bawean people in Vietnam do not recognize their origin culture.From the information found, as many as 400 bawean people, unable to master Indonesian.In their daily lives, they only use Vietnamese.Only Bawean residents are elderly, who are still smooth using Malay in communication.From the search results and interview data, they can speak Indonesian, when they are in school, because Indonesian subjects are indeed listed in the education curriculum in Vietnam.Even some Bawean people who live in Vietnam, are reluctant to go home, because they are married to Vietnam's original ethnicity, or do not know the existence of family news, on Bawean Island itself.

From the explanation of one of the Bawean residents in Vietnam, their citizenship status, administratively written as Vietnamese citizens.To take care of KTP, at first, Bawean people experienced difficulties in terms of administration.Bawean residents moved to Vietnam, before the status of Vietnam Merdeka.This is what causes debate, because the status of Bawean residents becomes unclear.Even Vietnam did not accept Bawean residents' ID cards, which was issued by the French government, because their status was written as Malay citizens.Then the Ethnic Cham offers Bawean citizens, becoming part of its ethnicity, because they feel equally Muslim.Bawean residents refused, because they were not ethnic cham.Because these Bawean residents have been living in Vietnam for a long time, the Vietnamese government finally recognizes them, as Indonesia.",2022-03-29T03:50:09Z,UCK29KfGuZ8lEDrjMnCf-G1w,Entertainment,244,2930364,0,0,1529,2023-11-07T09:41:03.930262,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l45trNNOK-I/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,l45trNNOK-I,"Hi, as we all know, Indonesians have an extraordinary distribution, not only here, but people with the blood of the Republic of Indonesia are also found in faraway places, for example, Madagascar Suriname, Christmas Island, even in New Caledonia, how come there are people? -There are many Indonesians there, ranging from colonialism to migration because it's still about the Indonesian population scattered everywhere in Vietnam, it turns out that there are also our brothers and sisters, they are Javanese or more specifically, the Baweans who live there to this day are unknown . not sure how these Bawean people got to a neighboring country.

Bawean when Vietnam was colonized by French troops at that time the Bawean people called the Boyans built the mosque out of wood. Now most of the Bawean people live around the ar-rahim mosque in Ho Chi Minh City, according to a statement from Imam Haji Ali, a takmir leader. the ar-rahim mosque has been around since 1885.

If we take it back to when industry revolution happen Many companies want to increase the amount of production this forced the workers in the factory to work 10-16 hours per day Just by imagining it has been exhausting But then, in May 1, 1886... ... The labor movement in the United States
protested the working time. :) They demanded 8 hours for work,
8 hours for rest,
and 8 hours for fun in a day. Until finally
The date became a history ... ... And celebrated as
International Labor Day every year. However, only the Ford cars company who use the eight-hour per day working time As a result of the shorter time of work ... Ford car company workers feel more
flexible and more productive at work. As a result, within a few years, this Ford company gain a really big profit ... So that eventually the working time of 8 hours
imitated by many other companies. lol Even so, not all workplaces
use the 8 hours per day working time. For example, many companies
in Japan who have a culture ... lol to demand workers to
work more than 8 hours a day. As a result, many workers

Below you will find our sun. Our star is 2
octillion tons of hot hydrogen gas emitting 400 septillion joules of energy every second.
The hottest part of the sun is its 15 million°C core, where it's been fusing hydrogen into
helium for the past 4.6 billions years. Despite that, it's only considered a middle aged star! Now let’s check out the closest planet to
our sun, Mercury. Orbiting the sun in just 88 days, Mercury also has the most elliptical
orbit of any planet. It spins very slowly, once every 2/3 of its orbital period. Despite its
surface reaching a blistering 430°C, it still has water ice in permanently shadowed craters near its
poles, where the temperatures stay below -170° C. The next planet in our solar system is Venus.
It’s the planet with the hottest surface temperature; at 460°C it’s hot enough to
melt lead. Its air is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide, with a thick layer of sulfuric
clouds. Its rotational axis is flipped upside-down, which means that the planet spins backwards. The third and best understood planet is Earth.
Our home planet has a dense metal core, a thick viscous rock mantle, and a thin crust.
It's unique in the solar system for having humans and permanent liquid water on its surface.
Other planets may get the former soon. At 3470 km in diameter, our Moon has the largest
moon-to-planet size ratio. It's thought to have formed when a small planet impacted Earth
at a grazing angle billions of years ago. It’s heavily cratered, and has huge flood
plains on it called maria. Next up in our system is Mars. Its iconic
red color comes from its rusty rocks and dust. In the past Mars was once very wet, with oceans,
a thick atmosphere, and a warmer climate. But its lack of a magnetic field meant no protection
from the solar wind, which eroded its atmosphere away. Between Mars and Jupiter is a large asteroid belt. It’s a ring shaped region containing rubble leftover
from the formation of the planets. Past the asteroid belt we find our systems
Jovian planets, starting with Jupiter. A gas giant, it’s the largest planet in our solar
system. It has a dynamic atmosphere, including belts, zones, and a gigantic red spot created
by a persistent hurricane. The Great Red Spot is a persistent anticyclonic storm. The spot
is large enough to contain three Earth-sized planets. It’s still unclear what exactly
gives the spot its red color. The next planet in our system is Saturn. It’s
a gas giant with a broad set of rings. It has a hexagonal cloud pattern on its north
pole. It's the least dense of all the planets, even less dense than water! Made up of ice
particles, Saturn’s rings are 250,000 km across, but only 10 meters thick! Gaps in the rings are created
the gravitational tugging of the moons orbiting Saturn. Uranus is an ice giant with a small rocky core and
a thick mantle of ammonia, water, and methane. It also has thirteen distinct rings. Uranus
has a huge tilt -- 98°, with respect to its orbit. A massive glancing collision long ago is one
hypothesis to explain the extreme tilt. Technically considered the last planet in
our solar system, Neptune is an ice giant, with a similar composition to Uranus. It’s
the most dense of the outer planets and the only planet found by mathematical prediction
rather than by empirical observation. At the outer edges of our solar system we find the
Kuiper Belt, filled with smaller rocky and icy bodies. Pluto is in this region. It was originally discovered
in 1930 and categorized as a planet, but it was recategorized as a minor planet in 2006. And there you go -- a crash course on our solar system.
Even though we've explored a lot of it, there's still a huge amount left to discover. And that's the beauty
of science: there's always more to learn. Thank you so much for watching! This video

Is this the governor of Jakarta's  (Ahok a.k.a Basuki Tjahaja Purnama) fault? Or this meatball seller's fault that his meatball's liquid dressing has been given way too much until it's spills out which finally makes Jakarta flooded (wow, amazing! :v) At the point Jakarta's flood is multidimensional problem It's starts from Jakarta's mainland itself that already difficult to absorb water in huge amount The government which is unready, and their citizens that really difficult to be regulated If we look from it's geographic side, Jakarta itself is formed from the rivers in Bogor and it's surroundings Big rivers like Ciliwung at the past brings materials from Mt. Gede, Salak, Pangrango with it And then it keep getting sedimented and stacked that forming a mainland that we call Jakarta The fun fact: those rivers also breaking through to the land that have formed, so that until now Jakarta still being flowed by many rivers And then when the dry season these rivers become smelly and dry But, when the rain season these rivers brings a huge volume of water At the end it makes the edge zone of the river get flooded When the urbanization happen, finally Jakarta become ""Jakarta"" (in the present) Many people live in the edge of the river, so that the absorption zone gone As the result the water can't be absorbed by the river's edge anymore and spreading anywhere Yet the Jakarta's residents' habit which is to litter on the river as already become a hereditary hobby that should be preserved At the end makes the river's flow not going smooth. And Jakarta flood happens Citizen's urbanization also makes Jakarta even more populated Many people build their house around Bogor and Puncak Where this construction makes the forest in this territory being cut off to build residences As the results the rain from Bogor and Puncak that should be absorbed by the forest directly flowing to Jakarta Like the meatball's liquid dressing that spill out from it's bowl (that's embarassing :/) The huge volume of water from Bogor and Puncak can't be accomodated by the rivers in Jakarta And ""JAKARTA FLOOD"" happens In the prediction of 2015, Jakarta get loss that reaching Rp3.000.000.000.000 only because of this flood Jakarta's provincial should be better to handle this problem Like giving prediction of flood, do a international institution teamwork and apply a strict regulations for drainage and the river's territory But, besides the provincial, the Jakarta's residents should be participate actively to handle the flood For example by reporting illegal residence constructions in the edge of the river And report a person who likes to litter by using progressive media Like ""qlue"" app that already exists in Playstore, the online complaint service ""report"", or send SMS to the governor that can be connected to Ahok (he's on campaign, lol) Until Jakarta Smart City that Jakarta's resident can supervise the government's work itself yeah, handle Jakarta flood can be very hard to be prepared Not only requires money, but also needs patience to resolve it And as always, thank you >:("

We are Indonesia,"We are Indonesia.

Indeed, the spirit of nationalism is still there!
It is possible that this spirit was eroded by the factors of globalization, economy, foreign cultures, and so on, but could not bury all of them.
The spirit of nationalism is only fast asleep because it does not find the stage of its interests in the hearts of the Indonesian people.At least it feels like that.
Proven 2014 elections yesterday easily some of us hated their siblings because of their differences of opinion.
Because of this concern and also to other problems related to injustice to certain minority groups, we were moved to rebuild it: a sense of nationalism!
Remind that being part of this nation is a proud destiny!
We are Indonesia, what about you?

Brother .. I am Indonesia
Not because of my choice,
But that's my destiny.
I am China
I am native
I am Moslem
I am Christian
I have a religion
I am Indonesian
Try to open your historical sheet
Look for me, the fact that we are not plural!
My presence has never been to threaten you!This land is permitted to be stepped on by differences. Cultural Differences
Difference in skin color
Differences in trust
So don't stick me up by force
But accept me with taste.
I refused to let stand
The injustice is accustomed
Distinguished treatment
It was never justified
As if blaming, the Creator of Differences
Show your face now, O individuals who feel equal to God!
Your presence is only needed to test our integrity!
But keep this in mind
We will stand up and rise to defend our brothers who are relieved by your people!
This awareness has long been fast asleep ..
Get up!!Wake up!!
Do you hear his voice?
Where the majority are united with a minority in a sense of solidarity!
I am Indonesian
Unite we are firm
Divorced we collapse
Merah Putih my color
Until the end of my life
I am Indonesian
We are Indonesia

Islam is the second largest religion after Orthodox Christians who have converted to Islam in Russia. now there are more than twenty million people Who is the love for me with ar-rahman in the perception of many people Russia is a large Orthodox Christian country but who would have thought that Islam in Russia is the second largest religion after Orthodox Christianity Hi really more than twenty million people have  converted to Islam, the city of Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan, one of the regions in Russia with the largest adherents of Islam in this city, 50% of the population is Muslim. Religious harmony in the city of Kazan is clearly visible in the heart of the city. Inside the Kremlin, which is the center of culture and government, stands side by side with the old Orthodox cathedral and the Kul mosque.  Sharif, which is the largest mosque in Russia and Eastern Europe, is the only Kremlin in Russia which contains a mosque. The Kul Sharif mosque was founded in 2005 to coincide with the 1000th anniversary of the city of Kazan. My name Syarif was taken to honor the name of this ethnic Tatar national hero from the mosque's architecture. Dominated by blue, it stands out with its high towers, ceilings inlaid with golden holy verses, adding to the beauty of the Kul Sharif mosque. The style in Muslim communities of the call to prayer still adheres closely to Islamic values. Greetings are always said when fellow Muslims meet. wow wow hmm I want to roqqota Aina ya syauqon The Taklim Assembly is also routinely held after Isha prayers or on Friday nights when the month of Ramadan arrives, Muslims in Kazan often hold events to break the fast together, gather to stay in touch and listen to lectures, which is also done the same as in Indonesia.  fasting in Russia lasts up to 19 hours but Muslims in Kazan still rejoice in worship to endure hunger and thirst hi hi hi far friends as the center of Muslim culture Russia every year the city of Kazan holds various Islamic activities such as the Hajj compression to a Muslim fashion show history records that the Soviet Union once  uncovering Islam for 74 years but with the power of Allah subhanahuwata'ala slowly but surely Islam has shown its resilience and is increasingly developing in the land of the red bear of Russia hi hi hi hi Hi confused hi hi Hi Ho"

If you need to pee when you're stuck in traffic, pee here, now. Try to imagine if we were the tree, what would we feel? 10 angry, maybe even if we could we would scream, but that's not much because if we imagine the tree-  smooth trees that burn and fall and are cut down might make us wonder, is it possible that these trees can think and talk and is it possible that they can make plans for revenge, basically what would happen if trees could really talk, even though so far there has never been a group of trees in people's homes? It turns out the answer is a shame to hide that trees can actually talk and it's like a school gang. They actually gather and chat until one tree can connect to as many AK47 other trees and fortunately they don't talk about tree fights in the forest. They talk to each other to protect each other.  share food, remember when there is danger and ask about each other's needs okay okay single people don't be happy yet because I Nyai also means your tree can be a friend to chat with on the palm Sunday now the question is how do these trees do all that to answer it Let's explore  go into the forest [Music] the rain all starts from big old trees. These mother trees can catch more sunlight and produce excess ingoo. Then under the ground swarms of sugar-hungry fungi grow around the roots. They then absorb the sugar and it's like  bartering helps channel nutrients from the soil to be absorbed into the roots Hi, but it turns out more than that, it turns out that this herd has mushroomed to a large extent and is also connected to other trees and just as cool as the mafia network in the movies, the hidden network of pots. This land turns out to be a place for many exchanges.  Very informative, for example, it's like an alarm when a tree is attacked by insects, they can give a signal to other trees so they can immediately take action to increase their defense. But unfortunately, research also shows that this means that when we cut down one tree, there are dozens of other trees and we don't count how many fungi come with it.  injured and just like Domino, various other living creatures are automatically threatened too [Music] so yes, we all know that forests are not just trees, but life there takes many different forms, for example this research shows how similar forests are to our society.  journalists, teachers, scientists, doctors and all of them play an important role, we just eliminate one, for example, all the doctors disappear and the whole system will be damaged in our country. Indeed, there is still a lot of corruption, riots, shortcomings in many world rankings, we are also backward, but Indonesia is also the one that, when it comes to the diversity of living things, is in the top five. the world is big, even though it only covers one percent of the earth's surface, this is where thousands of species of living creatures live and if all of that is lost, what else do we have? Soon we will celebrate Indonesian Forest Day, so let's share this video so that more and more people are aware, proud and want to protect Indonesia's forests .  for yourself. When was the last time you played in the forest and the beauty of nature? Come on, don't be shy, tell me in the comments column below and as usual Thank you. Thank you for watching.

Tobacco Warehouse PT Gudang Garam and Djarum,"When farmers screamed because the price of tobacco dropped, I was happy because PT Gudang Garam was still buying tobacco from Temanggung farmers.I came and saw the process of selling it myself

I also saw the company not ignorant of the health protocol.This is good and worth copying by other companies

At PT Djarum, new buying and selling transactions will be held next week.Hopefully the company's good intentions can help our tobacco farmers.Pray for it ...

[Music] [ Applause] the enthusiasm of the residents who came to get alternative treatment from Ida Andriani aka Ida Dayak was very high.  until the Kostrad Cilodong yard became a sea of ​​people last Tuesday, April 4, chaos broke out when residents were jostling each other in line. A number of TNI soldiers evacuated Ida Dayak because of the high enthusiasm of residents to get alternative treatment from him due to the large crowd of residents. A mother fainted due to exhaustion waiting for alternative treatment to be administered.  Ida's power to prevent widespread incidents, finally Ida Dayak's treatment was canceled, even though there were still many people who came hoping to get treatment, he said Monday to Thursday, on Tik Tok, I want treatment. Sorry, ma'am. If I may ask, what's wrong with diabetes? I can't walk at all. I can't walk at all.  movement How long has it been since University of Indonesia sociologist Ida Ruwaida assessed that people's enthusiasm for coming to Ida Dayak alternative medicine is a social phenomenon that must be facilitated and regulated by the government so as not to cause chaos. Medically, it takes time, right? It takes time and in fact, if we look at it  from a medical perspective, it might be thought that there is something that cannot actually be cured or that there is little hope, so suddenly Mrs. Ida Dayak appears, whom I would have seen myself if I had seen it. Yes, what is it called, how could it be like that? How could it be? Actually, her condition may be difficult medically, but  With Mother Power, how can this actually be what it's called? It should be something that needs to be facilitated by the government, because if not, it will cause unrest or even riots, resulting in friction between those who have high hopes for success. recovers Ida Andriani alias Ida Dayak carries out treatment by dancing rituals and applying oil to the sick patient's body parts.

This collectibility problem concerns a good name, yes, I have been knitting this name for 60 4 years. Don't let it be because of being stable that we are in trouble because these banks are the ones who are just forgiving. Bro, this is as Ustad Yusuf Mansyur said, never mind the conventional banks that have  so that the founders of sharia banks are crueler, crueler, that's true, I say that sharia banks are crueler, crueler games, Oh yes, I actually experienced one thing, when we were in debt, we asked for a reduction in interest, we weren't given it, we didn't want to pay it off, we weren't given it, it's strange, funny but true, this is funny, but  it's real, so finally I told you about a conventional bank, namely there was a case in March, it was a sharia bank whose name I don't need to mention, and after this year and now, the damage was done, I policed ​​him, because the money I put in 800 billion to pay the debt, the money was not received, but like this, I  I can't pay it off, but every month my interest is taken from there and then I take ejjv, it's very unfair to withdraw the police report and this process continues, the money, the water, says that when I return my money, there will be interest, there's a meter, he returns it, it turns out 800 billion is considered his return, Bun, he doesn't return everything, he returns it all.  690 R 110 billion, he held back the interest payments or the reply said, I'll pay it off, well, this is a sharia bank which according to Stezo Lim is cruel and corrupt, so people say it's a loan shark, but it's possible that Yusmono's house looks like this is a syndicate of sharia banks, there are more or less 10 syndicates and this is  extraordinary So I can't mention this first because previously the case that seemed to have just been revealed was only Yusuf who dared to reveal it, maybe this was just my class being bullied by our brothers below and I will prove that this is an injustice and I was going to blackmail 20000000000 he said  have to pay a fine for compensation or what is the rationale? Where else is it difficult for people to trade quietly and customers want to pay their debts in full? Sir, now you are all stuck in a traffic jam, our car is being restructured, but it's being done. But let the police work run its course and I don't think I will back down, no matter how hard it is.  depreciation is not just a special staff entrepreneur for the Minister of Youth and Sports, so I don't believe in running a syndicate like that. Wow, the mafia is not a syndicate, but here it is given that the syndicate is really a syndicate, the syndicate is trying to extort 20,000,000,000 20.4 billion or 26 billion in compensation so they are willing to be one side is not the m  rohmani but the m o f i k e"

This collectibility problem concerns a good name, yes, I have been knitting this name for 60 4 years. Don't let it be because of being stable that we are in trouble because these banks are the ones who are just forgiving. Bro, this is as Ustad Yusuf Mansyur said, never mind the conventional banks that have  so that the founders of sharia banks are crueler, crueler, that's true, I say that sharia banks are crueler, crueler games, Oh yes, I actually experienced one thing, when we were in debt, we asked for a reduction in interest, we weren't given it, we didn't want to pay it off, we weren't given it, it's strange, funny but true, this is funny, but  it's real, so finally I told you about a conventional bank, namely there was a case in March, it was a sharia bank whose name I don't need to mention, and after this year and now, the damage was done, I policed ​​him, because the money I put in 800 billion to pay the debt, the money was not received, but like this, I  I can't pay it off, but every month my interest is taken from there and then I take ejjv, it's very unfair to withdraw the police report and this process continues, the money, the water, says that when I return my money, there will be interest, there's a meter, he returns it, it turns out 800 billion is considered his return, Bun, he doesn't return everything, he returns it all.  690 R 110 billion, he held back the interest payments or the reply said, I'll pay it off, well, this is a sharia bank which according to Stezo Lim is cruel and corrupt, so people say it's a loan shark, but it's possible that Yusmono's house looks like this is a syndicate of sharia banks, there are more or less 10 syndicates and this is  extraordinary So I can't mention this first because previously the case that seemed to have just been revealed was only Yusuf who dared to reveal it, maybe this was just my class being bullied by our brothers below and I will prove that this is an injustice and I was going to blackmail 20000000000 he said  have to pay a fine for compensation or what is the rationale? Where else is it difficult for people to trade quietly and customers want to pay their debts in full? Sir, now you are all stuck in a traffic jam, our car is being restructured, but it's being done. But let the police work run its course and I don't think I will back down, no matter how hard it is.  depreciation is not just a special staff entrepreneur for the Minister of Youth and Sports, so I don't believe in running a syndicate like that. Wow, the mafia is not a syndicate, but here it is given that the syndicate is really a syndicate, the syndicate is trying to extort 20,000,000,000 20.4 billion or 26 billion in compensation so they are willing to be one side is not the m  rohmani but the m o f i k e"

Taylor is the mother of the six year old boy who police say shot his teacher, Abby's Warner. Taylor now faces felony child neglect and a misdemeanor charge. And Speracco is live in Newport News for us tonight with details on the indictment and then we're getting a lot of new information tonight. David Jana. Yeah, this is a big development, three months in the making with so many people nationwide just asking the question, who will be held responsible in this case? In addition to the six year old mothers, we are 6 year olds mother. We are now learning more people could possibly be charged in this case. It's an unprecedented case watched nationwide and months into the investigation we're learning more about who prosecutors are holding responsible. More than three months after Newport News police say a six year old boy shot his teacher, Abby Swerner, inside Ridge Neck Elementary School, a grand jury formally charged the boy's mother, 25 year old Deja Taylor. Newport News Calm Wells Attorney Howard Quinn says Taylor now faces charges of felony child neglect and recklessly leaving a loaded gun endangering a child after Newport News investigators say the boy took her 9 millimeter handgun and brought it to school in early January. Quinn told 13 News now his investigation showed the law does not support charging the child with aggravated assault. But he says this isn't the end to his investigation. Gwen is asking the court to appoint a special grand jury to look into security issues within the school that may have contributed to this incident. A spokeswoman for the school division confirmed the elementary school did not have metal detectors. And a school security officer was not on scene at the time of the shooting, Quinn says. Depending on the special grand juries and further investigation, more people, including Taylor, may face additional charges if the law supports it. In response to this latest development, Appy's Werners attorney Diane Tuscano sent us a statement saying in part. Today's announcement addresses but one of those failures. Our lawsuit makes clear that we believe the school division violated state law, and we are pursuing this in civil court. We will not allow school leaders to escape accountability for their role in this tragedy. And Abby's Werner's attorneys filed a lawsuit for $40 million in court last week. In that lawsuit, her attorneys claimed that school administrators ignored a vital warnings from school employees that the boy had a gun on him at school of the day of the shooting. Now, the attorney representing the now former principal of the school says they plan to file a countersuit. The assistant principal of the elementary school has since resigned from her position, reporting live in Newport News. I'm Annes Baraka for 13 news now. Deja Taylor's attorney, James Ellenson, released a statement this evening. He thanked the Commonwealth's attorney for sharing the news of the indictment. He said Taylor will turn herself in later this week."

Well, what's unique is that actually there are institutions whose work is to look for it.  extraterrestrial life in the past, this agency started from a NASA research project and the name of the institute was quiet and there was a protocol that was created to explain what steps we needed to take if we found an alien signal from outer space. First of all, of course, the party who found it  I have to check whether this signal really comes from intelligent Elin, not from a space anomaly. If you are sure, the research data must be shared with the international scientific community so that it can be analyzed further. I also have a task force that can help in the analysis process. We also need to think about whether it is better to send a signal back.  to them or not and here there needs to be a consultation with the UN body that deals with outer space, but even though it sounds complete, in fact there is no government or state body that has made this protocol so it can officially be used if aliens actually contact humans, then does that mean we are not ready?  meeting aliens, the answer is still not certain, but we can't just assume that life out there doesn't exist, for example when we first sent humans to the Moon, the returning astronauts had to be quarantined first because we were afraid they would carry bacteria or viruses that could be dangerous.  for humans or the satellites that we send to investigate Jupiter and its moons are destroyed in the planet's atmosphere so that the bacteria from the earth in the blood don't destroy life in the sea and Jupiter's moons, but wait a minute, these are just microbes, what would happen if they were aliens?  With the space ship that comes to us, what is our reaction? Our brains are used to defending ourselves against predators. This famous scientist once said that we have to be careful if we are approached by aliens who have technology much more sophisticated than ours, even though they have made one of Hawking's biggest Elin search efforts too.  warns that it is very possible that the elements we encounter are nomadic creatures whose job is to colonize other planets like Columbus when he discovered the American Continent and ended up bringing destruction to the original inhabitants. The possibility of aliens out there who could attack us is scary but it's just as scary if we're just alone there.  In the vast universe, we are indeed curious about life out there, but can we be sure that this curiosity will not lead us to catastrophe [Music] Outer space is full of secrets that are difficult to put into a short video under 5 minutes So there is a mystery Come on, let's understand the answer together in the first book. How come it contains 3 big chapters to explore in hundreds of distinctive illustrations? How come it conveys our human struggle to understand the universe, rich in facts and stories and full of color from the first page and besides opening the imagination and Curiosity about outer space, this book is also one of the best ways for you to support it.

an ending that all living creatures must face, but in fact scientists have succeeded in
finding a way to make us live longer and at the same time making us cheat
death. Okay, without further ado, it turns out the answer is by
preserving our dead bodies.  which for Later in the future it can be brought
back to life or the complicated term is imagination next OK OK, how do you do it and
can this really be done? In short, yes, but the process is long
and very complicated because first the body whose heart is no longer beating will immediately be
frozen. Hi and  in this phase our body is considered to be dead but not in the teenage relationship
of today our body organs will then be looked after so that they remain durable and don't rot and
of course we don't use an ordinary refrigerator because our dead body will be put into a
giant tank filled with liquid nitrogen at the same temperature. super super cold and so that our cells don't
freeze we will also be given a special liquid which then becomes the question again whether
this method can really work. The point is that if we get to the freezing stage and just
keep the organs alive, this has actually been done by many organizations, even the fact is
surprising.  Currently, there are approximately 300 patients whose deaths have been delayed by
waiting. It's not that easy because until now, in fact, no patient has been
successfully resurrected. Why can't it be because in short the safety pin is still confused about how to
remember a body that has been frozen? It's not as simple as remembering the Nazis yesterday  at night because even the slightest mistake,
the cells in our body can immediately be destroyed, that's why scientists are still very careful
before they try to irrigate a frozen body that was previously and apart from that, the classic reason is that
the cost of keeping a body alive in a tank is actually very expensive.  expensive because
our bodies need many needs such as oxygen, nutrition and many more, spending
money equivalent to five to ten Avanza cars. Hi, but wait a minute, if humans
can actually come back to life, maybe you don't realize that there is a big problem that we will
face if people don't die.  This means that the human population will never decrease, have
you ever thought that even though this is the case, the Earth is already very full and in fact, if this
happens in 50 years, the Earth's population will soar to this crazy extent and
maybe if that really happens, finally these purple creatures will come and finally
we will  You have to accept that he's a pitkam dog, so it's okay, maybe until now escaping from
death is still a big thing, which is super crazy if there's a lot of controversy, preserving our bodies and coming
back to life in the future is still a big dream for humans, but looking at science like
Nano technology which is increasingly developing, isn't it? maybe this will happen.  Then,
after watching this video, what do you think, would you like to be given the opportunity to cheat
""death""?  And as always thank you. This activity is supported by the Australian Government through the Australian Alumni Grant Scheme which is administered by the Australia Awards in Indonesia."

This is, of course, not because the sky is playing favoritism. The fact is, the sun scattered the blue light with greater energy compared to the purple light Besides that, our eyes are more sensitive towards blue light In our retina, there are millions of light sensitive cells shaped like ice cream cones These cone cells are sensitive to red light, green light and blue light The point is, if our eyes have to choose between blue and purple, even angels know the answer Then, why does the afternoon sky appear reddish? because at midday, the sun is right above our head, but when it is afternoon there is a further distance between us and the sun, which has a low angle in the sky And so, the sunlight has to travel more through a thicker atmosphere before reaching the earth On its way, the blue light 'bounced off' to other directions, hence it is slower than the red light, which reaches our eyes first In the end, what can be viewed is the strong red and orange light So, now we know why the sky is blue.

The moon is the answer first of all. Of course the night sky will be brighter, more beautiful and our videos will be more aesthetic, but wait a minute, because it turns out that's the end of the good effects, because apart from that, maybe you've never thought about the new moon, it's like being the third person in a relationship.  The earth and the moon and the third person AHM will of course have more problems because of what? Firstly, if there are two moons, it will be difficult for us to determine the time of day, the night will be longer, the nocturnal animals will have to adapt and they will be smarter than usual, the seasons will also be  changes and makes everyone hungry because of crop failure and the glare of the night sky will also make it difficult for our bodies to sleep so kenzou mby and do the negative effects stop here? Of course it's not good. These impacts are just the tip of the iceberg. Why is it because of the moon's additional gravity? Secondly, this will make the ocean waves bigger than usual, maybe surfers will definitely like big waves but not necessarily others because big waves will also erode the land. We imagine that our country, which has thousands of villages on the seashore, will be really worried and this too  also doesn't mean that those who live in the highlands also automatically get lucky because not only this new gravitational sea, it turns out it can also pull the earth's soil layers, other disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and rain, Abdul will come and could cause mass extinction, okay, okay, take a breath, maybe we  Enough of all these nightmares for now, because the next question is, is it possible that the Earth actually has two moons? Hi, Hi, the answer is actually maybe, maybe, for example, this scientist suspects that 80 million years ago, it turns out that the Earth once had two moons, one moon was three times the size.  smaller than our current moon, they lived happily together, until one day a collision destroyed the moon that we can see in the sky now. In 2020, researchers also found in Naraku a tip of a dwarf moon that has been in orbit for almost the last three years. The funny thing is that its size is only  It's a small car and even though it's cute and small, unfortunately it only lasts for a short time because this dwarf moon turns out to come from a group of celestial objects that are close to the earth and what's more surprising is actually in history there are lots of dwarf moons that have stopped by, starting from this official thanksgiving. the size of Filemonas, there are even ones as big as mountains, but yes, having two moons turns out to be scary, isn't it like one thing, the more the better, the earth is enough with just one moon, but if we look at the neighboring planets, the situation is actually the opposite. To close this video, it's actually the opposite.  How come you don't ask questions? Why do you think they can have so many moons and as usual, thank you Hi? Thank you for watching. How come you have photos? Just write in the comments column below. Keep asking and stay curious. Hi, hi the lounge"

Of course, the original taste of Germans after that is the Western European race and several other races, while the lowest race is those who are even homosexuals and are also disabled by the uncle with the square mustache and his henchmen.  Their henchmen are a group that is considered unfit to live [Music] and that is an evil and scary plan called Thank you Google Translate, yes, this is a plan for colonization and massacre of ethnic groups. If Germany wins, the rastadi will be exterminated and the rest who are still alive will be made into crazy slaves of massacre, right?  This is only done on certain rasters but also on people with disabilities, even though they belong to the original German race, this is done to keep the descendants of the Aryanto nation as superior and perfect as crazy as they can be. Okay. OK, now let's see the impact on world order. If Germany wins, that means its friends  I also participated in Berjaya and a writer once thought that this would be the shape of the world if the three countries became rulers, Germany would cross the entire continent of Europe, Italy would be the master of North Africa and Japan would be the ruler of Asia, including Indonesia, while America would be divided into 3 parts, some controlled by Japan, the other side is controlled by Germany and there is a zone trapped between the two countries, that's okay, but will their victory have any effect on Indonesia? Of course, if at that time Germany, Italy and Japan win, it means these two places won't be level with the ground, that means we won't be independent.  Japan will still continue to colonize Indonesia and make their ideology really stick in our brains so maybe we will see Japanese letters more often than the alphabet or our names will have a Japanese touch like Heri Hatori or Susisi Zuka. In essence, our country's politics and economy will be controlled.  for their purposes [Music] Yes, that's roughly the shape of the world we would have lived in if Germany had won the Second World War with the Nazi ideology which was like an iron fist and the Japanese colonialism which was very torturous. You could say our lives would be very far from freedom but be grateful because all dreams It's bad, it's just an assumption that might never happen. OK. What do you think could happen? If Germany wins World War II, write in the comments column and as usual, thank you [Music] Thank you for watching. How come you have any more questions?

Breaking News: Discovery of Potential Life Outside Earth,"In 2020 it didn't stop giving us surprises for the surprise.And now, there is one more surprise for us, which is probably the most ngagetin of everything.A group of scientists from various parts of the world, with large telescopes in different countries, just found something in space there.Not outside the galaxy, not on our favorite Mars planet;But on the planet that we usually ignore - Venus.

This is an extraordinary historic and unexpected discovery.We have found, the strong potential for life outside the earth.Looks like we are no longer alone.Although not, we are not seeing UFOs who stop by.But of course, this finding is not less amazing: we find mysterious substances that only produce living things - and in large quantities.So, what is this mysterious substance?How can they be there and why can we say that this is a sign of life?Enjoy the video!

It seems we are no longer alone, even though we don't see it.  there are more UFOs so but of course this finding is no less amazing, we managed to find a mysterious substance that is only produced by living creatures and in large quantities, so what exactly are these mysterious substances and how do they get there and so we can say that this is  a sign of life Hi OK, so if it's on earth, it's possible that this substance originated because of two reasons, either it was created in a lab or it emerged naturally from microbes. If you look at the first choice, the first possibility is clear, maybe because there certainly aren't any sophisticated laboratories there and that's why this is speeding. Scientists and alien lovers suspect that it is possible that the two phosphines were formed due to the existence of living creatures on the planet Venus, imagine our own weight in a vast expanse of desert and then find footprints in front of us. What's more, even though this is a simple activity, this is a crazy discovery because in so many places  what we think is that there are living creatures, Venus never includes air full of toxins, the pressure is deep in the sea and the heat is like a giant oven to the point where it can melt metal which is usually used as a shield for nuclear radiation and from many planets and how the potential for life actually appears in places like this, in short, because  It turns out that there is a part that is safe from the tightness and heat of Venus, not on land but like tens of kilometers between the clouds, this is where the pressure and temperature are somewhat similar to Earth and could possibly support the existence of microbes. Now scientists from various parts of the world are being challenged to explore this rocky planet again because  Maybe we've been looking in the wrong place all this time looking for other life in space. Maybe this astronomer's prediction 53 years ago turned out to be true. There is a universe and life that is full of mysteries and questions. Even on the planet Venus, which we thought was in a terrible condition, there is actually potential for life. We were like that too, millions of billions of years ago, our earth's conditions were also extreme, but life still emerged and continued to develop, we are also part of it. What we are witnessing now could be the beginning of a great history. Get ready because this is just the beginning and as always Thank you  thank you Thank you for watching. How come you have any more questions, just write them in the comments column below fan king and stay curious"

- and a massive thank you to everything for watching this and for all of your support!",2021-10-09T14:42:15Z,UCu0yQD7NFMyLu_-TmKa4Hqg,Education,258,961805,43679,0,4912,2023-11-07T09:41:44.112768,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Q1-KFB5Xv4/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,3Q1-KFB5Xv4,"in [Music] the world has been destroyed, the cannibal monsters that used to be like us have destroyed the city, they roam around looking for human flesh, it's better, okay, wait a minute, what do you want? Yes, usually they only exist in films or games, but what happens if the Zombie terror becomes a reality? Maybe we can  Congratulations [Music] of course the next possibility is slim if no one is ready, it turns out there is a special document prepared by America called the eigrp complaint, which in short, the document contains the necessary scenarios if the zombie apocalypse really happens, starting from the Mandau disease process of evacuating residents to the real war with the  living corpses now Yes, it's exactly the same now in films, but wait a minute, even though it's cool, in fact this document is not a real plan, aka it's actually just for practice. So the point is, we still have to be prepared, whatever happens and if it really happens, what are the chances of people...  Our rich people can survive. OK, let's count. Because to live farming, we can actually follow the guidelines that the American Ministry of Health has prepared to deal with these undead, for example, from food, drink, first aid kits to radios and other items that are no less important, even from there.  We are also advised to plan an escape route if they have already forced their way into the house because for example, there is a study which says that the zombie infection is predicted to infest this big city in just one day, just imagine that other capital cities are also full of zombie attacks, it will be very fast and it will continue to be like that.  Since we were discussing earlier, how likely is it that real zombies could exist ? Hi, sense, prove that they exist, but not like in the movies, but rather that they do exist, real zombie insects, kizomba fungi, which are common in the interior of the forest, can infect and control the insect's body and then force the insect to move.  out of control and killed so that the fungus can reproduce, that's what happens in this game when the infection can attack humans too. It's similar to diseases that also come from other species. Fortunately, up to now, this fungus has not been proven to be able to infect us, we become clouds, bro, human zombies.  That's just a lie, right? OK, lock your doors now because it turns out it could actually exist but it's not Mad alive and it's actually because of a viral infection that makes sufferers become confused, hyperactive and when they get angry, at first glance they look like zombies and in theory, this virus is mutated or engineered.  If the virus could become stronger and spread quickly and if that happens, it's possible that in the future we will actually experience a Zombie Virus pandemic. Currently, we have experience in dealing with pandemics as long as we understand that zombie attacks don't have to be the apocalypse that wipes out humanity by knowing the knowledge.  the research and the opposing methods hope for us to survive will remain and as usual thank you hi hi hai hai hai hai Thank you for watching. How come you have any more questions, just write them in the comments column below fan king and stay curious [Applause]"
