Executive produced by Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and Gary Goetzman, The Pacific is an epic ten-part miniseries. The Pacific tracks the intertwined real-life stories of three U.S. Marines – Robert Leckie, John Basilone, and Eugene Sledge – across the vast canvas of the Pacific Theater during World War II. The miniseries follows these men and their fellow Marines from their first battle with the Japanese on Guadalcanal, through the rain forests of Cape Gloucester and the strongholds of Peleliu, across the bloody sands of Iwo Jima and through the horror of Okinawa, and finally to their triumphant but uneasy return home after V-J Day.

The Pacific is based in part on the books “Helmet for My Pillow,” by Robert Leckie, and “With the Old Breed,” by Eugene B. Sledge, with additional material from “Red Blood, Black Sand,” by Chuck Tatum, and “China Marine,” by Eugene B. Sledge, as well as original interviews conducted by the filmmakers.",2009-07-13T14:56:57Z,UCVTQuK2CaWaTgSsoNkn5AiQ,Entertainment,92,5939384,11760,2710,2023-08-26T17:57:19.847518,e99B80crU3E

Ninja Assassin - Official Trailer [HD],"Ninja Assassin - Official Trailer

Release Date: Wednesday November 25th, 2009.
Genre: Action
Cast: Bi Rain, Naomie Harris, Stephen Marcus, Randall Duk Kim, Yuki Iwamoto
Director: James McTeigue
Writer: Matthew Sand, J. Michael Straczynski
Studio: Warner Brothers

========================================

Wow, I'm really excited about this one. I can't believe that is Bi Rain! He's sure come a long way from singing; and from acting in small romance TV shows. And his English? Wow, it sure has improved by the sounds of it. In 'Speed Racer' he had very little lines and was sort of hard to understand with his heavy accent. But in this trailer, his English is almost perfect.

In comparison, I'm surprised singers/actors like Justin Timberlake hasn't attempted to take on roles like this here in North America. Wow, seriously, I now have a new-found respect for Rain.

========================================

Plot: 
Ninja Assassin follows Raizo (Rain), one of the deadliest assassins in the world. Taken from the streets as a child, he was transformed into a trained killer by the Ozunu Clan, a secret society whose very existence is considered a myth. But haunted by the merciless execution of his friend by the Clan, Raizo breaks free from them and vanishes. Now he waits, preparing to exact his revenge.

In Berlin, Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) has stumbled upon a money trail linking several political murders to an underground network of untraceable assassins from the Far East. Defying the orders of her superior, Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles), Mika digs into top secret agency files to learn the truth behind the murders. Her investigation makes her a target, and the Ozunu Clan sends a team of killers, led by the lethal Takeshi (Rick Yune), to silence her forever. Raizo saves Mika from her attackers, but he knows that the Clan will not rest until they are both eliminated. Now, entangled in a deadly game of cat and mouse through the streets of Europe, Raizo and Mika must trust one another if they hope to survive and finally bring down the elusive Ozunu Clan.

GASLAND Trailer 2010,"GASLAND - (2010) Directed by Josh Fox. Winner of Special Jury Prize - Best US Documentary Feature - Sundance 2010. Screening at Cannes 2010.

It is happening all across America and now in Europe and Africa as well - rural landowners wake up one day to find a lucrative offer from a multinational energy conglomerate wanting to lease their property.  The Reason?  In America, the company hopes to tap into a huge natural gas reservoir dubbed the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. Halliburton developed a way to get the gas out of the ground—a hydraulic drilling process called fracking—and suddenly America finds itself on the precipice of becoming an energy superpower.

But what comes out of the ground with that natural gas? How does it affect our air and drinking water? GASLAND is a powerful personal documentary that confronts these questions with spirit, strength, and a sense of humor. When filmmaker Josh Fox receives his cash offer in the mail, he travels across 32 states to meet other rural residents on the front lines of fracking. He discovers toxic streams, ruined aquifers, dying livestock, brutal illnesses, and kitchen sinks that burst into flame. He learns that all water is connected and perhaps some things are more valuable than money.",2010-05-06T04:48:22Z,UCx8nDqE2P9N_J3UaUc2KOEA,Film & Animation,167,2474882,7537,1621,2023-08-26T17:51:05.227693,dZe1AeH0Qz8

Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is a slacker by day, party animal by night... until he finds a serious career that's seriously cool: crime-fighting action hero. As the Green Hornet, he teams up with gadget wiz and martial arts master Kato (Jay Chou) to take down LA's underworld. Even Britt's assistant Lenore (Cameron Diaz) doesn't suspect this mismatched pair is the masked duo busting the city's toughest thugs led by Chudnofsky (Academy Award® winner Christoph Waltz, 2010, Supporting Actor, Inglourious Basterds). With style, swagger and an arsenal of awesome gear, the Green Hornet and Kato are doing justice their way, making every mission a mix of over-the-top action and outrageous comedy.

SYNOPSIS: Zeitgeist: Moving Forward, by director Peter Joseph, is a feature length documentary work which will present a case for a needed transition out of the current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which governs the entire world society.

THEATRICAL RELEASE - Zeitgeist: Moving Forward is planned to be released in 60+ countries and in 20+ languages starting January 15th 2011. This large scale release is not associated with any major distributor.

DVD/INTERNET RELEASE - This is a non-commercial project, which means it will be available for free acquisition via internet in both viewing form and full DVD download. ZeitgeistMovingForward.com will also have a physical $5.00 DVD available in mid to late January.

Into The Wild - Theatrical Trailer,"we have a great new channel for horror/sci-fi fans: http://bit.ly/getmehorror


--------------------------------


""Into The Wild"" is in many ways the rightful successor of ""Stand By Me"" (1986) - an epic adventure and self discovery journey, which throws us into the inner world of the hero(s) and his own unique way to find meaning in his life. Both movies are tremendously moving and inspiring - because the characters are so beautifully portrayed as genuine human beings we can all identify with.

Based on a true story. After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness.

Fast Five - Teaser Trailer,"http://www.thefastsaga.com/

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker lead a reunion of returning all-stars from every chapter of the explosive franchise built on speed in Fast Five.  In this installment, former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) partners with ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) on the opposite side of the law.  Dwayne Johnson joins returning favorites Jordana Brewster, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Matt Schulze, Tego Calderon and Don Omar for this ultimate high-stakes race. 

Since Brian and Mia Toretto (Brewster) broke Dom out of custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities.  Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom.  As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead.  But he's not the only one on their tail.

Hard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) never misses his target.  When he is assigned to track down Dom and Brian, he and his strike team launch an all-out assault to capture them.  But as his men tear through Brazil, Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad.  Now, he must rely on his instincts to corner his prey...before someone else runs them down first.

THE TREE OF LIFE Official HD Trailer,"From Terrence Malick, the acclaimed director of such classic films as BADLANDS, DAYS OF HEAVEN and THE THIN RED LINE, THE TREE OF LIFE is the impressionistic story of a Midwestern family in the 1950's. The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.",2010-12-16T00:35:07Z,UCor9rW6PgxSQ9vUPWQdnaYQ,Film & Animation,133,2659147,17067,1146,2023-08-26T17:51:53.390933,RrAz1YLh8nY

I Saw The Devil Trailer,"I SAW THE DEVIL is a shockingly violent and stunningly accomplished tale of murder and revenge from Korean genre master KIM Jee-woon (The Good, The Bad, The Weird and A Tale of Two Sisters). Oldboy's CHOI Min-sik plays Kyung-chul, a dangerous psychopath who kills for pleasure. The embodiment of pure evil, he has committed horrifying and senselessly cruel serial murders on defenseless victims, successfully eluding capture by the police.

On a freezing, snowy night, his latest victim is the beautiful Ju-yeon, daughter of a retired police chief and pregnant fiancée of elite special agent Dae-hoon (The Good, The Bad, The Weird's LEE Byung-hyun). Obsessed with revenge, Dae-hoon decides to track down the murderer, even if doing so means becoming a monster himself. And when he finds Kyung-chul, turning him in to the authorities is the last thing on his mind.

The lines between good and evil fall away in this diabolically twisted game of cat and mouse. Pushing the concept of revenge to its most extreme limits, KIM Jee-woon brilliantly transcends the police procedural and serial killer genres in surprising and thrilling new ways.",2011-02-22T22:08:54Z,UCneoi6WTgRjMh4otvpwzv8w,Film & Animation,135,4409829,23162,2056,2023-08-26T17:51:25.087845,xwWgp1bqVwE
Apollo 18 (2011) - Official Trailer [HD],"TRENDING ON OUR BLOG: http://zindiq.co/2017/08/10/everyone-in-asia-is-wearing-offensive-language-t-shirts/






The new hyped ""found footage"" movie, but this time a grand production. 
The film is about the real mission to space in the 1970's that was canceled by NASA, or as the tagline says ""There's a Reason We've Never Gone Back to the Moon""...
Officially, Apollo 17, launched December 17th, 1972 was the last manned mission to the moon. But a year later, in December of 1973, two American astronauts were sent on a secret mission to the moon funded by the US Department of Defense. What you are about to see is the actual footage which the astronauts captured on that mission. While NASA denies its authenticity, others say it's the real reason we've never gone back to the moon.
Just don't make it vampires again...

Anonymous - Trailer,"Release Date: 4 November 2011 (United States)
Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, Anonymous speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds ranging from Mark Twain and Charles Dickens to Henry James and Sigmund Freud, namely:  who was the author of the plays credited to William Shakespeare?  Experts have debated, books have been written, and scholars have devoted their lives to protecting or debunking theories surrounding the authorship of the most renowned works in English literature.  Anonymous poses one possible answer, focusing on a time when cloak-and-dagger political intrigue, illicit romances in the Royal Court, and the schemes of greedy nobles hungry for the power of the throne were exposed in the most unlikely of places: the London stage.

Abduction (2011 Movie) - Official Trailer - Taylor Lautner),"A young man unwittingly thrust into a deadly world of covert espionage.

For as long as he can remember, Nathan Harper (Taylor Lautner) has had the uneasy feeling that he's living someone else's life. When he stumbles upon an image of himself as a little boy on a missing persons website, all of Nathan's darkest fears come true: he realizes his parents are not his own and his life is a lie, carefully fabricated to hide something more mysterious and dangerous than he could have ever imagined. 

Just as he begins to piece together his true identity, Nathan is targeted by a team of trained killers, forcing him on the run with the only person he can trust, his neighbor, Karen (Lily Collins). Every second counts as Nathan and Karen race to evade an army of assassins and federal operatives. But as his opponents close in, Nathan realizes that the only way he'll survive -- and solve the mystery of his elusive biological father -- is to stop running and take matters into his own hands.

The Thorn Birds in Ten Minutes,"Made for my Mom for Mother's Day, her favorite book and miniseries. RIP Mary Lynn Morris [née Gindhart]  (1963-2014)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugfqXgx3I-4

My mom could be kind of a pain in the ass. She could also suffer from a near constant momentary lapse of reason. That's okay because she managed to pass both traits on to her oldest child. Like any proud Irish woman, she was not blessed with an easy life. And yet despite all this, she managed to worm her way into my top three favorite people of all time.

My mom wasn't perfect and she never claimed to be. She didn't believe in gender equality on the grounds that men would always be the inferior sex. In her chest beat the heart of a true artist, endlessly seeking the beauty and enlightenment in the darkest of corners. Courtesy of Grandmom Gindhart, she inherited an abundance of gallow's humor and taught me never to take anything (most of all myself) seriously. She taught me that there is no statute of limitations on the words, ""I'm sorry."" She always fought for the underdog and believed that empathy for all people was the path to true happiness. She believed in rock 'n roll and that music would save your mortal soul. She taught me not to fear the reaper and that I could and would achieve anything I sought out to do. She believed that art could and should be both dangerous and beautiful. She taught me to never to believe in the twin lies of consumerism and cynicism. She taught me to love people for who they were rather than who I wanted them to be. I am not educated enough to possess the words to accurately describe what my mom meant to me; as such I will cease wasting your time trying to do so.

The last time that I spoke to my best friend was a few months ago. I had called to wish her a happy 51st birthday (as usual a day after the fact). Due to her illnesses, she had been in a lot of chronic pain for nearly a decade. However, on this call she was excited for the future in a way that I hadn't heard for some time. She was excited for her upcoming trip to NYC. She was excited to see her granddaughters. She was excited to meet the woman I love, the woman she had come to refer to as her second daughter. She sounded ready to embark on the third act of her life. The penultimate conversation I had with her consisted of me telling her that I just wanted to make her and Dad proud because of how how hard they had worked when we were growing up. She only responded, ""Honey, we felt that way about each of you since the three of you learned how to breath on your own."" When she went to sleep the next evening, I'd like to believe it was happy and hopeful.

I wish I could say that she woke up the next morning, but she didn't. For a woman who liked her power ballads writ Jim Steinman large, she went out on her own relatively quiet terms; quietly, happily, and with a minimum of fuss. I wish that I had a better reason for why she's gone than, ""She just didn't wake up."" Alas. So it goes.

This was my first Mother's Day without her. There were days where I wanted to punch someone, anyone, just to feel that this was real. There were days where I wished I were more religious just so I would have some deity to hate. However, she wouldn't want me or anyone to be sad or angry on her account. If she were here, she would immediately say, ""Get on with it."" But then she would impart each one of us to heed the immortal words of Eden Ahbez, ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.""

The entire 1983 8 hour Thorn Birds miniseries in ten minutes. I own nothing. All rights belong to David Wolper-Stan Margulies Productions, Edward Lewis Productions, and Warner Bros.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Permian loses by inches; the coach (Billy Bob Thornton) and players absorb the loss.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
H.G. Bissinger's best-selling true-life account of a few months in the life of a high-school football team comes to the screen in this adaptation written and directed by Peter Berg. Odessa, TX, is an oil town in the western part of the state that's home to the Permian High School Panthers, the football team with the best winning record in the state. Odessa is a town with more than its share of problems; the decline of the oil business in Texas has set the city's economy into a tailspin, and racial tensions still erupt into violence on occasion. But football is the one thing that brings all the people of Odessa together, and on Friday nights every fall, as many as 20,000 people fill Permian's football stadium to watch Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) and his boys try to lead the team to victory. As Gaines works to build a winning team in a town where victory is prized above all else, however, his players struggle through the emotional trials common to any teenager and ponder the fact that there is little future in their hometown...and that a championship season can be as much a burden as a triumph. Friday Night Lights also stars Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, and country singer-turned-actor Tim McGraw.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
From the director of Gone Baby Gone, comes a crime film set in the streets of Boston, where four bank robbers including Doug (Ben Affleck) and James (Jeremy Renner) are chased by an FBI agent (Jon Hamm). To complicate matters, Doug falls in love with the woman (Rebecca Hall) he took as a hostage.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Boston bank robber Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) falls for a woman his gang had previously taken hostage after feigning a chance meeting with her to ensure that she can't identify them in Affleck's adaptation of author Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves. The son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner), the most dangerous of the bunch, is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known.

Killer Elite (2011) Movie Theatrical Trailer HD - Robert De Niro Clive Owen Jason Statham,"When his mentor (Robert De Niro) is taken captive, a retired member of Britain's Elite Special Air Service (Jason Statham) is forced into action. His mission: kill three assassins dispatched by their cunning leader (Clive Owen).

The film is currently being shot at Docklands Studios Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia. Filming began on May 13, 2010, based at the Docklands Studios Melbourne in the Docklands. In July 2010, Jason Statham's scenes were shot at the Brecon Beacons in Wales. (The British S.A.S. regiment trains there and that is thought to be one of the reasons why it was chosen as a location for the movie.) In May 2010, it was announced that Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro would join the cast, shooting for ten days in a small role as an assassin. De Niro filmed a scene in Melbourne's Spring Street set in 1970s Paris.[4]
Some London scenes are currently being filmed in Cardiff -- on July 29, De Niro and Statham were seen filming outside The Promised Land Bar on Windsor Place.
On July 28, 2010, location filming took place near the Storey Arms outdoor centre, in the Brecon Beacons. A number of 1970's period cars were in evidence, particularly a bright orange Austin Maxi. The peaks of Pen Y Fan are accessible from this location, and are known to be used by the SAS as part of their selection process and ongoing training.

The Killer Elite is a 1975 American action thriller film starring James Caan and Robert Duvall and directed by Sam Peckinpah.
The screenplay was written by Marc Norman and Stirling Silliphant from the Robert Rostand novel Monkey in the Middle. The film represents the last collaboration between Peckinpah and soundtrack composer Jerry Fielding, who apparently felt the creative partnership had run its course.

Two agents belong to the so-called Killer Elite, a private mercenary organization working for Com-Teg: Communications Integrity Associates (i.e., CIA).
George Hansen, having been bought out by an unknown rival group, assassinates a man they are supposed to be protecting, and shoots his partner Mike Locken in the knee and elbow as part of the bargain.
Crippled for life and his career seemingly at an end, Locken undergoes a long rehabilitation and earns another assignment from his Com-Teg contact man, Cap Collis. It requires him to protect an Asian client, Yuen Chung. It also gives him the opportunity to seek revenge against Hansen, who is part of the team out to assassinate the client.
Locken, now skilled in martial arts with the help of his cane, recruits a couple of former associates, Miller and Mac, to help him. However, the deal turns out to be an elaborate set-up, part of an internal power struggle involving the Com-Teg directors, Collis and his superior Weybourne.
Hansen gets the drop on Locken, but is killed by Miller. A final showdown between the Asian rivals takes place aboard an abandoned naval vessel in port, with Locken and Mac involved in the fray and confronting Collis one last time.",2011-06-23T00:03:59Z,UCi8e0iOVk1fEOogdfu4YgfA,Entertainment,97,4170359,4492,1253,2023-08-26T17:52:18.906787,8F1wrDsUqYc

Writer/Director Craig Brewer (""Hustle & Flow,"" ""Black Snake Moan"") delivers a new take of the beloved 1984 classic film, ""Footloose.""  Ren MacCormack (played by newcomer Kenny Wormald) is transplanted from  Boston to the small southern town of Bomont where he experiences   a heavy dose of culture shock.  A few years prior, the community was rocked by a tragic accident that killed five teenagers after a night out and Bomont's local councilmen and the beloved Reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) responded by implementing ordinances that prohibit loud music and dancing.   Not one to bow to the status quo, Ren challenges the ban, revitalizing the town and falling in love with the minister's troubled daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) in the process.

In ANOTHER EARTH, Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling), a bright young woman accepted into MIT's astrophysics program, aspires to explore the cosmos. A brilliant composer, John Burroughs (William Mapother), has just reached the pinnacle of his profession and is about to have a second child. On the eve of the discovery of a duplicate Earth, tragedy strikes and the lives of these strangers become irrevocably intertwined.

Genre: Drama

Official Site: http://anotherearth.com

Director: Mike Cahill

Cast: William Mapother, Brit Marling, Jordan Baker, Robin Lord Taylor, Flint Beverage

Writers: Mike Cahill, Brit Marling
 
Mike Cahill- In his auspicious debut, director Mike Cahill offers a taut, superbly conceived science fiction romance that marks the emergence of the multitalented actor/screenwriter Brit Marling. Marrying character with high concept, Another Earth lures audiences to go where no one has gone before.  Another Earth, directed and written by Mike Cahill and written by Brit Marling, is the recipient of the 2011 Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Now in its ninth year, the Prize carries a $20,000 cash award by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and is presented to an outstanding feature film focusing on science or technology as a theme, or depicting a scientist, engineer or mathematician as a major character.
 
William Mapother is an American actor and former teacher. Mapother has become widely known as a character actor, who sometimes plays scary or otherwise dark characters. Despite playing a pivotal role in Todd Field's In the Bedroom, Mapother is perhaps more widely known as Ethan Rom in the TV show Lost. The character was killed off early in the first season, but since then has appeared in seven episodes mainly through flashbacks, once due to time travel and another in an alternate timeline. This brings the total amount of Lost episodes he appeared in up to eleven. Mapother has also had considerable roles in a series of independent films, such as The Lather Effect, Moola and the upcoming Hurt, in which he stars alongside Melora Walters as the 'reclusive' brother-in-law of Walters' character. Mapother starred in The Burrowers as a former Indian fighter who joins a posse to help find missing white settlers, only to discover that the hunters have become the hunted.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a small village in the Shire a young Hobbit named Frodo (Elijah Wood) has been entrusted with an ancient Ring. Now he must embark on an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval ""Middle-earth"" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the ""One Ring,"" a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson's native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).

PREMIUM RUSH - Official Trailer - In Theaters August 2012,"Release Date: 24 August 2012 (United States)
Dodging speeding cars, crazed cabbies, open doors, and eight million cranky pedestrians is all in a day's work for Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the best of New York's agile and aggressive bicycle messengers.  It takes a special breed to ride the fixie -- super lightweight, single-gear bikes with no brakes and riders who are equal part skilled cyclists and suicidal nutcases who risk becoming a smear on the pavement every time they head into traffic.  

But a guy who's used to putting his life on the line is about to get more than even he is used to when a routine delivery turns into a life or death chase through the streets of Manhattan.  When Wilee picks up his last envelope of the day on a premium rush run, he discovers this package is different.  This time, someone is actually trying to kill him.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Hit men, gangsters and robbers converge in Quentin Tarantino's violent tale of revenge. Stars John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.

In one long-overdue weekend, they will discover what has changed, who hasn't and that time and distance can't break the bonds of friendship.

It was summer 1999 when four small-town Michigan boys began a quest to lose their virginity.  In the years that have passed, Jim and Michelle married while Kevin and Vicky said goodbye.

Safe House - Trailer,"http://nooneissafe.com

Oscar® winner Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds star in the action-thriller Safe House.  Washington plays the most dangerous renegade from the CIA, who comes back onto the grid after a decade on the run.  When the South African safe house he's remanded to is attacked by mercenaries, a rookie operative (Reynolds) escapes with him.  Now, the unlikely allies must stay alive long enough to uncover who wants them dead.

For the past year, Matt Weston has been frustrated by his inactive, backwater post in Cape Town.  A ""housekeeper"" who aspires to be a full-fledged agent, the loyal company man has been waiting for an opportunity to prove himself.  When the first and only occupant he's had proves to be the most dangerous man he's ever met, Weston readies for duty.

Tobin Frost has eluded capture for almost a decade.  One of the best ops men that the CIA's known, the ex-intelligence officer has given up assets and sold military intel to anyone with cash since he turned.  From trading secrets to North Korea to aiding splinter cells, the damage he's done to the U.S. is immeasurable.  And he's now back on the reservation with a secret.

As soon as Frost is brought in for debriefing, mercenaries come and tear apart Weston's safe house.  Barely escaping, the unlikely partners must discover if their attackers have been sent by terrorists or someone on the inside who will kill anyone standing in the way.  Now it's up to Weston to figure out who he can trust before they're both eliminated from the game.",2011-11-04T01:05:21Z,UCqKvLGIb1MxkxaeVUKBPwzA,Film & Animation,153,9769733,5991,1469,2023-08-26T17:52:41.204417,oWzTOoOpFa8

DARK SHADOWS - OFFICIAL TRAILER 1  [HD],"http://darkshadowsmovie.warnerbros.com
In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet—or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles. Also residing in the manor is Elizabeth's ne'er-do-well brother, Roger Collins, (Jonny Lee Miller); her rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Moretz); and Roger's precocious 10-year-old son, David Collins (Gulliver McGrath). The mystery extends beyond the family, to caretaker Willie Loomis, played by Jackie Earle Haley, and David's new nanny, Victoria Winters, played by Bella Heathcote.",2012-03-15T18:17:22Z,UCpAh2aB7crUevvrWXPDVOtw,Film & Animation,153,4650335,12131,2304,2023-08-26T17:52:52.931819,4cVcpz8H3Pk
Synth Britannia,"Documentary following a generation of post-punk musicians who took the synthesiser from the experimental fringes to the centre of the pop stage.

In the late 1970s, small pockets of electronic artists including the Human League, Daniel Miller and Cabaret Volatire were inspired by Kraftwerk and JG Ballard and dreamt of the sound of the future against the backdrop of bleak, high-rise Britain.

The crossover moment came in 1979 when Gary Numan's appearance on Top of the Pops with Tubeway Army's Are Friends Electric heralded the arrival of synthpop. Four lads from Basildon known as Depeche Mode would come to own the new sound whilst post-punk bands like Ultravox, Soft Cell, OMD and Yazoo took the synth out of the pages of the NME and onto the front page of Smash Hits.

By 1983, acts like Pet Shop Boys and New Order were showing that the future of electronic music would lie in dance music.

Contributors include Philip Oakey, Vince Clarke, Martin Gore, Bernard Sumner, Gary Numan and Neil Tennant.",2012-03-16T15:42:31Z,UC1AYOc0gKIyWb_CZ5JSb25w,Entertainment,5293,915150,11577,1153,2023-08-26T17:54:32.992476,TK1P93r9xes

In 2009, independent video game designer Markus ""Notch"" Persson released a work in progress that would go on to break every industry rule for achieving success. Part exploratory adventure, part creative building tool, ""Minecraft"" evolved from a cult classic into an unprecedented hit, raking daily sales in by the thousands. By the end of 2010, Notch was able to quit his day job and live the dream of founding his own development studio, Mojang. 

This feature-length documentary follows the young company over the course of its first year as their profile expands across the world stage and into the homes of millions of gamers. Featuring insights from industry icons (Peter Molyneux, Tim Schafer), journalists (Geoff Keighley, Stephen Totilo), tastemakers (Gabe & Tycho of Penny Arcade), and players profoundly impacted by the game (Yogscast, The Shaft, Minecraft Teacher), the film serves as a time capsule for one of this generation's most unorthodox success stories.

Minecraft: The Story of Mojang is the second feature from game culture archivists 2 Player Productions (Reformat the Planet, Penny Arcade: The Series - Season 1, Double Fine Adventure!). Funded through crowdsourcing site Kickstarter.com, the production spanned nearly two years in locations across North America and Europe.",2012-12-17T21:46:10Z,UCf7SLiNsDj_RCe_WEjUM3Rw,Film & Animation,128,752507,7403,1206,2023-08-26T17:53:32.413967,SXEdspVDMxw

Beautiful Dreamer - Brian Wilson and the Story of 'SMiLE',"This documentary tells (using modern day interviews and archival footage and sound tapes) the story of how in 1967, while his band The Beach Boys triumphantly toured abroad, Brian Wilson was trying to push the boundaries of conventional pop music with a new follow-up to the Beach Boys' cutting-edge mega-hit, Pet Sounds. The new album was to be called ""SMiLE"". SMiLE pushed the envelope both musically and lyrically, and was supposed to out-do the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper record. But Brian wasn't able to sell the project to his band-mates when they returned. The project was shelved and Wilson's well-documented decline into depression, drug abuse, recluseness, and obesity had begun. Thirty-odd years later, Wilson announced that in 2004, SMiLE would be performed live in its entirety in London. This film tells the story of a damaged but healing artist bringing his greatest work to light. Written by Martin Lewison

Using a minimalist black-and-white style, the short follows the story of a lonely young man in mid-century New York City, whose destiny takes an unexpected turn after a chance meeting with a beautiful woman on his morning commute. Convinced the girl of his dreams is gone forever, he gets a second chance when he spots her in a skyscraper window across the avenue from his office. With only his heart, imagination and a stack of papers to get her attention, his efforts are no match for what the fates have in store for him. Created by a small, innovative team working at Walt Disney Animation Studios, ""Paperman"" pushes the animation medium in an exciting new direction.",2013-01-31T17:10:47Z,UC_976xMxPgzIa290Hqtk-9g,Film & Animation,81,7440950,34182,1943,2023-08-26T17:53:27.473862,mM6cLnscmO8

Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (voice of Billy Crystal) was a little monster, he has dreamed of becoming a Scarer—and he knows better than anyone that the best scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first semester at MU, Mike's plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot James P. Sullivan, ""Sulley"" (voice of John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer.  The pair's out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University's elite Scare Program. To make matters worse, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right. 

Screaming with laughter and oozing with heart, Disney•Pixar's ""Monsters University"" is directed by Dan Scanlon (""Cars,"" ""Mater and the Ghostlight,"" ""Tracy""), produced by Kori Rae (""Up,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Monsters, Inc."") and features music from future Rock-and-Roll-Hall-of-Fame--inductee and award winning composer Randy Newman (""Monsters, Inc.,"" ""Toy Story 3""). The film opens in U.K. cinemas on July 13, 2013, and will be shown in Disney Digital 3D™ in select cinemas.

In theaters May 10th.

Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" follows would-be writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without of the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles.",2013-04-04T13:00:01Z,UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g,Entertainment,164,4031333,14688,2504,2023-08-26T17:54:04.891495,ozkOhXmijtk

Grudge Match - Official Trailer [HD],"https://www.facebook.com/GrudgeMatchMovie
http://grudgematchmovie.com
In theaters Christmas Day.

Award-winning movie legends Oscar® winner Robert De Niro (""Raging Bull,"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"") and Oscar® nominee Sylvester Stallone (the ""Rocky"" films, ""The Expendables"") star as old boxing rivals who come out of retirement for one final match. De Niro and Stallone play Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen and Henry ""Razor"" Sharp, two local Pittsburgh fighters whose fierce rivalry put them in the national spotlight. Each had scored a victory against the other during their heyday, but in 1983, on the eve of their decisive third match, Razor suddenly announced his retirement, refusing to explain why but effectively delivering a knock-out punch to both their careers. Thirty years later, boxing promoter Dante Slate Jr., seeing big dollar signs, makes them an offer they can't refuse: to re-enter the ring and settle the score once and for all. But they may not have to wait that long: on their first encounter in decades, their long-festering feud erupts into an unintentionally hilarious melee that instantly goes viral. The sudden social media frenzy transforms their local grudge match into a must-see HBO event. Now, if they can just survive the training, they may actually live to fight again.",2013-09-12T23:30:32Z,UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g,Entertainment,152,4911520,17722,1654,2023-08-26T17:54:57.787270,1bQSOBJCPQE

Synopsis:
When they ran to save their lives for the first time, they were mere 12-year-old boys, and the world called them 'refugees'.

The war of 1971 gave birth to a new country - Bangladesh. It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram and Bala. They witnessed the war and its aftermath, where the world tried to trample over them. Fighting for survival, they clung to each other and escaped to Calcutta.

Before they knew the world, they knew each other. Such was their bond, such was their friendship.

Each time they sought new beginnings, each time they would rise, the world would crush them down. So, they fought again... and again. Together they were unbeatable. They were unstoppable. They were inseparable.

In the years that passed, Bikram and Bala, became Calcutta's most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless and most powerful GUNDAY!

They had everything... then, one fine day, bells rang...

Nandita, the most beautiful cabaret dancer, walked into their lives, and they lost everything to her. Their murky world turned magical and colourful. They fell head over heels in love with her.

But that was only a blissful lull before an impending storm...

And then entered ACP Satyajeet Sarkar, the right for every wrong, a law for every outlaw and a counter force for Bikram and Bala.

What follows from here is the most sensational-most thrilling-most dramatic story ever told!

Manny Pacquiao Movie - Official Manny Pacquiao Trailer - MANNY,"Manny Pacquiao Movie - Official Trailer - ""Manny"" narrated by Academy Award Nominee Liam Neeson and directed by Ryan Moore and Academy Award Winner Leon Gast. Coming 2014. *Official World Premiere at 2014 SXSW Film Festival.

Synopsis:
From abject poverty to becoming an eight time boxing world champion, congressman, and international icon, Manny Pacquiao is the true definition of a Cinderella-man story.

In the Philippines, he first entered the ring as a sixteen year old weighing ninety-eight pounds with the goal of earning money to feed his family. Now, almost twenty-years later, when he fights, the country of 100 million people comes to a complete standstill to watch. The army and the rebels cease-fire. There are no cars in the street. There is zero crime. An entire country becomes united.

Regarded for his ability to bring people together, Pacquiao entered the political arena in 2010. As history's first boxing congressman, Pacquiao now fights for his people both inside and outside of the ring. Now at the height of his career, he is faced with maneuvering an unscrupulous sport and maintaining his political duties, while still supporting his family and sustaining a personal life. The question now is, what bridge is too far for Manny Pacquiao to cross?",2014-01-31T00:53:36Z,UCwqaeLxjyxkn0YCIy0rwMsQ,Film & Animation,147,2297849,8692,1104,2023-08-26T17:56:33.047581,Qqi_DVcSMPY

Having had two huge box-office hits with ‘Main Hoon Na’ and ‘Om Shanti Om’ – the successful pairing of Farah Khan and Shah Rukh Khan are back with a new film – ‘Happy New Year’.

The premise is simple. It’s the Christmas–New Year holiday season. The biggest dance event in the world, the World Dance Championships, is being hosted in Dubai. While all eyes are on the different world-class teams that have gathered, there are a few unlikely entrants who have somehow managed to stumble into the competition.

Happy New Year is built around 5 disparate characters who are fighting a most unlikely battle.. a battle of international proportions.. but it’s a battle being fought on a dance floor. Where the rest of the world’s competitors are battling for national pride and glory on the world stage, our 5 are dancing for a different cause.. revenge, retribution and closure. This is Team India, a group that has no confidence in its own dancing abilities, but is competing for a cause very important to them.

With the city of Dubai as the backdrop, and its global village ambience as its setting, Team India set about their task of staying in the competition. What follows is a manic run to the finish, where our characters face several challenges in their quest for victory as the film reaches its climax, a climax that is full of national pride, diabolical revenge and triumph.

How this bunch of losers transform themselves into a team that performs really well and how they win over the hearts of the people in the city and across the world, forms the rest of the story.

Wanderers   a short film by Erik Wernquist,"Taken and promoted with permission from Erik Wernquist

For more information and stills gallery, please turn to: erikwernquist.com/wanderers
(Just in case my website runs slow, here is a link to an imgur album version of the gallery: imgur.com/a/Ur5dP)
Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available.
Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea with the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.

Get Hard Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Will Ferrell, Kevin Hart Movie HD

When millionaire hedge fund manager James (Will Ferrell) is nailed for fraud and bound for a stretch in San Quentin, the judge gives him 30 days to get his affairs in order. Desperate, he turns to Darnell (Kevin Hart) to prep him for a life behind bars. But despite James’ one-percenter assumptions, Darnell is a hard-working small business owner who has never received a parking ticket, let alone been to prison.

Together, the two men do whatever it takes for James to “get hard” and, in the process, discover how wrong they were about a lot of things – including each other.

Fatherland 1994 HQ,"Fictional historical account of what might have happened if Adolf Hitler had won the Second World War. Germany has corralled all European countries into a single state called Germania, and continues fighting against the Soviet Union. It is now 1964 and Germany's war crimes against the Jews have so far been kept a secret. Germany believes that an alliance with the United States would finally beat the Soviet war machine. As his 75th birthday approaches, Hitler wants to talk peace with President Joseph Kennedy. An SS homicide detective and an American journalist stumble into a plot to destroy all evidence of the genocide; evidence that could destroy the peace process with America and evidence that Nazi and SS leaders will stop at nothing to keep hidden.

Tom Canboro is a police detective with a Christian sister, Eileen, a brother, Calvin, a wife, Susan, and eccentric brother-in-law, Jason. One night, Jason seemingly goes insane and tries to kill Eileen, calling her a ""hater"". Tom soon realises this may be a conspiracy going as far as devil worship, but as he speeds in his car to get help, he suddenly loses control and crashes. Waking up in a strange hospital, he finds years have passed and people all over the world are wearing the mark of 666 on their right hands, and all those who don't are being killed off. Franco Macalusso, the believer in world peace Jason was fond of, now controls the world, and is trying to bring the world together as it was at the tower of Babel. Meanwhile, the ""Haters"" or Christians are hiding out and airing TBN tapes on the air for people to realise the Messiah is really the Antichrist, but their leader, Helen Hannah, is arrested...

EXPO – Magic of the White City (Narrated by Gene Wilder) | Free Full Documentary,"Narrated by Gene Wilder, EXPO – Magic of the White City brings the Chicago World’s Fair to life. Experience the world of 1893 through a cinematic visit to Chicago’s Columbian Exposition.

Subscribe for more great documentaries!

Nearly 28 million people visited the Fair. Dubbed the “White City,” it inspired future innovators like Henry Ford and Frank Lloyd Wright, unveiled the Ferris Wheel and Cracker Jack®, and, in many ways, marked the beginning of the 20th century.  Many of the era’s greatest achievements in science, technology and culture were unveiled there. The grounds were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for his design of New York City’s Central Park, and constructed under the supervision of Daniel Burnham.

The Fair was an engineering marvel. On opening day, President Grover Cleveland depressed a golden telegraph key which sent the first courses of electricity throughout the Fair powering fountains, machines, electric railways and thousands of lights. It was the first use of electricity on such a massive scale.

In addition, fairgoers enjoyed the Midway Plaisance where a one-mile boulevard of fun offered camel riding and guilty pleasures such as belly dancing, street fighting and beer drinking. Against the backdrop of 1893’s troubles with workers’ rights, prejudice, discrimination and corruption, the World’s Columbian Exposition cast a brief ray of hope for the future of humanity.

Filmed in spectacular High-Definition, EXPO – Magic of the White City immerses viewers in one of the world’s biggest extravaganzas and one of the most unforgettable events in American history. There will never be another event like it… or will there?",2016-01-08T21:57:38Z,UC_SzXeIdnTyNIc7gXHXs_iw,Entertainment,6950,427958,3469,1401,2023-08-26T17:50:13.034644,cpOQE5KJJds
Montana Sky 2007,"MONTANA SKY 2007
PLOT:
   Half-sisters Willa, Tess, and Lily Mercy are left their wealthy father's multimillion-dollar estate, including his Montana ranch, after his death. The only stipulation is that the women will have to live with each other for a year.
    Having never previously met, the three sisters, who have very different personalities, agree to the strange situation (mostly because each of their 1/3rd share is worth 8 million dollars), despite having reservations about their forced family 'reunion'. The biggest problem the women face, however, is the discovery of a saboteur in their midst.
    It seems that when their father died, he left some bitter enemies behind, enemies who would love to see his daughters fail. Now, in order to get what is rightfully theirs, the three siblings will have to work harder than ever before to clean up the mess their father left behind.
    During their trial, all three find love, and realize that maybe their situation wasn't such a bad thing after all.

Shadow Company Official Full Documentary,"In the late 20th Century the distinction between soldier and mercenary became blurred. The recent use of private military companies (PMCs) in Iraq has been more extensive than at any time in modern history. The brutal killing of four PMC employees in Fallujah in April 2004 made it clear that these “contractors” are not merely workers in a foreign land. But are the lives of such men the only thing at risk when we privatize warfare?

Shadow Company explores the moral and ethical issues private military solutions create for PMC employees, for the Western governments who foot the bill for their salaries, and for everyday citizens like you. The filmmakers traveled the globe to expose all sides of the issue, interviewing PMC staff, owners and lobbyists, former mercenaries, academics, journalists and top authors. So what is really at risk? See the movie and decide for yourself.

Then buy the full DVD with multiple commentaries and special features clips at http://www.shadowcompany.com

(also check the original graphic novel about Executive Outcomes at http://www.executiveoutcomesthemovie.com)

""Takes a thorough and balanced look at the use of private security forces in Iraq and raises serious policy questions,""
U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA)

“Great job.  Covers a controversial issue in an evenhanded fashion.”
Colonel Thomas X. Hammes, USMC (retired)

""Shadow Company is a must-see film for anyone who is concerned about our military and our security being privatized.""
Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL)

”In addition to being extremely well-executed, I thought its even-handed tone was particularly sophisticated - encouraging an audience to consider the complexity of the issue, rather than the more exploitative depictions with which the subject is usually treated”
Director Ed Zwick - Director of The Last Samurai and the soon to be release Blood Diamond
