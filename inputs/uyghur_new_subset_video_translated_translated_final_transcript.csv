TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Ahead of Anas Urbaningrum's freedom, many speculations have emerged related to the former Democratic Chairperson.

The latest, Anas is called preparing a surprise speech and alludes to have a special agenda with the Chairman of the Democratic High Council Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY).

Related to this, Anas is expected to still have heartache and will turn around attacking the Democratic Party.

Reported by Tribunnews, this was conveyed by the political observer of Al Azhar University Ujang Komarudin when confirmed on Monday (10/4).

""The most Democrats will feel disturbed by Anas's free. Because after all Anas was imprisoned, however because of the Democratic Party,"" Ujang said.

Anas is said to still have a mass base to be able to attack Democrats.

For this reason, Ujang requested that the Democratic Party be relaxed regarding Anas's free.

Even so, Democrats could be offensive if Anas later issued his attack.

""It should be cool, just relax, don't panic like that. Unless Anas opens a new Democratic case, it can be an offensive Democrats. Just relax, just COOL.he concluded.

"Send weapons to help Ukraine, Slovakia suspicious of Russian technicians deliberately damaged MiG-29 fighter jets","International News: https://kaltim.tribunnews.com/topic/berita-international-terkini

Slovakia suspects that the MiG-29 fighter jet that will be donated to the Ukraine army has been saved by Russia.
Russian technicians who previously cared for the aircraft were estimated to have 'work on' before being submitted to Ukraine.
This was revealed by Defense Minister Slovakia Jaroslav NAD 'on Friday (7/4/2023).

Nad's statement emerged after former Prime Minister Slovakia Robert Fico criticized the government in Bratislava for handing over the valuable plane to Kiev.
Slovakia retired the MiG-29 fighter fleet last summer because most of the aircraft did not operate.
Last month, the Slovakia government announced it would provide 10 MIGs with engine and three other machines without an engine to Ukraine forces.
Four jet has been sent and patrolling in the sky above Kharkov, according to Ukraine officials, while the other nine is expected to arrive in the near future.
However, Nad 'now shows that the jet may be deliberately damaged by Russian technicians who have worked on a plane at Sliac Air Base in Slovakia until last year.
He added that while the investigation failed to prove the bad intentions of the engineers, the Ministry of Defense ""felt lost confidence in Russian technicians"" because mistakes continued to emerge ""in places they can only do.""
The former Slovakia's highest pilot, Lubomir Svoboda, also stated that there was a ""bad"" work on the jet.
The Russian Embassy in Slovakia, meanwhile, has criticized officials for sending a jet to Ukraine, on the grounds that the step is ""illegal"" because it requires Moscow's approval based on a bilateral agreement.
He also warned that such shipping could cause ""escalation of conflict that could not be predicted and dangerous.""
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stated that the MiG-29 will be destroyed by Russian troops such as other western weapons sent to the country.
Peskov also said he got the impression that the Allied Kiev uses Ukraine only to ""discard old hardware that they don't need anymore.""
Peskov added that it would not affect the results of Russian military operations but instead could cause additional suffering for Ukraine himself and its people.
MiG-29 was designed in the 1970s and began operating in the 1980s.
Warsaw's plan to move four fighters to Kiev ""in the next few days"" was announced by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki earlier this week.
This makes the first NATO State Poland that promises fighter aircraft to Ukraine.
The country has 28 MIG-29, but it is unclear how many of them are in working conditions, because the country has tried to renew its air forces with US and South Korean fighter aircraft.
Slovakia, who is also a member of NATO, announced on Friday that they would send 13 MIGs to Kiev.
However, the jet retired last year, and several reports stated that most were not in operational conditions. (*)

#ToThePoint #Sacramento #California",2022-08-17T01:58:11Z,UCT350j4u6alUKyF9eu2bGug,News & Politics,297.0,82922,2075,0,123,2023-11-07T11:03:21.679154,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/frXGpmF1SEs/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,frXGpmF1SEs,"And this is a critical time of the year. Fire danger is growing, and it's hard not to think about the drought under these conditions. California's drought is a multibillion dollar issue, many possible solutions the state has explored or synthetic. But some scientists climate scientists are finding that working with nature could be more effective because sometimes you just have to leave it to the Beavers. A lot of people, they just want to see us try everything. Anything that has a chance of making this better. Like all in and the data is pretty clear that letting Beavers be Beavers and getting our rivers back into a healthier state is part of the firefighting problem. That's right, she said. Beavers are a part of helping in California's firefight. Just look at these before and after photos the before showing the land without Beaver, the after when Beavers. Were allowed to thrive. This is a passion project for Emily, inspired by events like the 2000 Mantor Fire in the southern Sierra. That fire was really, really intense and it caused a lot of destruction around the Pacific Crest Trail and a bunch of Beavers up there were just absolutely, totally fine photos from that fire showing green patches directly near the Beaver Dam surrounded by chart out land when Beavers move into a landscape, especially dry places like the American West by building their dams and slowing that water down what they wind up doing is creating these patches. That are very resistant to both droughts and wildfires. Their dams do this by holding water on the land, longer, recharging the groundwater, and improving plant health. These green stretches of land then act like speed bumps to fire spread, and after a fire, the runoff of hazardous debris slows at the Beaver dams settling to the ground, making the water healthier downstream for fish and other aquatic species. Beavers do all of these benefits. These environmental services, for we the people. That we're currently spending hundreds of millions of dollars to address. They do. They provide all these benefits for free and they do it better and cheaper? Brock Dallman is part of the bring back the Beaver campaign, along with other advocates. They are working to reverse the state's position that Beavers are a nuisance when they damn things. Sometimes they impound water on parts of the land that people don't want wet, or they cut down trees that people don't want cut down. Or they may plug a culvert or a drainage ditch. But Brock and his team are focusing on how to introduce. Non lethal solutions benefiting both the environment and people. So how to live with the Beavers? How to wrap wire around trees, how to fake the Beavers out with these really interesting pipes and cages that allow water to flow over the dam and regulate the height of the dam. These are the types of nature based solutions Native Americans like the Yurok tribe near the Klamath River basin have been using for generations. Beaver are just they're magical. You know, I mean, there's there's a reason why there are, you know, Keystone species. That's a species that has such a profound effect on its environment that if it didn't exist, that whole ecosystem may not exist. Sarah says one of the ways the Yurok tribe is sustaining and restoring the Klamath River basin is building what are called Beaver Dam analogs. Essentially human made Beaver dams that helped the Beaver thrive. You would think it would be pretty easy to do a restoration project, but there's so many permits. And requirements that that slow you down and we cannot be slowed down. The time to act as yesterday and it's part of the reason the state is looking at how Beavers can be part of the governor's 30 by 30 initiative, which sets a goal of conserving 30% of our land and coastal waters by the year 2030. The newly passed budget now putting money into Beaver restoration and relocation. Here and down they swing down to the ground near a stream or a lake. The box opens and a most unusual and novel trip ends for Mr. Beaver that's right in the 1940s and 50s, Idaho Fish and Game relocated Beaver by flying them into different areas, parachuting them to the ground. There was that history mid part of last century of releasing them that way, but we'll be very thoughtful about how we bring the Beavers in, likely moving them by trucks into areas where Beavers are wanted. Are needed another big part of this plan? Education. Understanding the beneficial effects that Beavers have. Understanding how you can live with Beavers. Adding another important tool in the tool chest. Addressing drought and wildfire impacts. If you think about all of the rivers and streams that we have and should have in this state, if we can get even just a fraction of those back into a more resilient and functioning state than every single one of those is like a speed bump for the fire or speed bump for the drought effects. And that was chief meteorologist Monica Woods. You'll be hearing more from her and the rest of the ABC 10 weather team right here, onto the point."

History of the Earth Part 2: Phanerozoic Eon – Paleozoic Era,"We just cruised through the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic eons. That brings us all the way to the Phanerozoic eon, which is the one we are still living in today. This is split up into the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras, so let's hit these eras one at a time, since so much happened in each one. First up, the Paleozoic era!

of Earth’s history at the end of the Proterozoic eon, and the Cambrian explosion. The first era of the Phanerozoic Eon is the
Paleozoic Era, which lasted from 541 to 252 million years ago. It was a time of great change, and many new
types of organisms evolved during the Paleozoic. The Burgess shale provides a detailed look
into the strange creatures of the time, like Hallucigenia. Nature experimented with a wide variety of
different body designs during the Cambrian, many of which went extinct. A factor that influenced the rapid radiation
of animals was the lack of predators during and immediately after animals first evolved,
which allowed for large populations since they were not hindered by predation. Life began in the oceans, and by the Early
Phanerozoic, was beginning to invade the barren lands, pioneered by the first vascular plants,
which were later followed by lungfish and other creatures looking for new food sources. The colonization of land by vascular plants
had a large impact on the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, which cooled the
Earth so much that it caused a mass extinction event. Land plants laid the foundation for brand
new ecosystems, as other organisms moved into forests looking for food and shelter, the
most consequential being a population of lungfish that evolved leg-like fins. These new animals, amphibians, were the first
vertebrates to walk on land. All vertebrates, from dinosaurs to humans,
share a common ancestor with amphibians. Before long, the land was colonized by amphibians,
which evolved into reptiles near the end of the Paleozoic. The main innovation that marks the evolution
of amphibians to reptiles was the rise of the amniote egg. It allowed reptiles to reproduce on dry land,
whereas amphibians must return to water for this part of their life cycle. The Paleozoic was a time of great mountain
building along Eastern North America. North America collided with three separate
land masses, causing three separate orogenies, or mountain building events. The first orogeny is called the Taconic Orogeny,
occurring 450 million years ago. The second is called the Acadian Orogeny,
at 380 million. And the third and final orogeny, called the
Alleghanian Orogeny, occurred 300 million years ago and was responsible for forming
the Appalachian Mountains. These mountains were around the size of the
Himalayas when they first formed and have extensively eroded over the past 300 million
years, leaving behind the resistant stumps of a once great mountain range. The Alleghanian orogeny concluded with the
assembly of the supercontinent Pangea at the end of the Paleozoic. An important geologic period toward the end
of the Paleozoic Era is called the Carboniferous Period. A geologic period is a more specific classification
of geologic time compared to an era. The Carboniferous Period is named for the
large deposits of coal that were formed during this time, deposits that span the entire globe. Coal forms when plant tissues are rapidly
buried in anoxic conditions in coastal and inland swamps. Rapid burial of organic material requires
rapid fluctuations in sea level, which are caused by the formation and melting of glaciers,
so without Carboniferous glaciers, the Industrial Revolution may not have occurred! In summary, the Paleozoic Era was a time of
dramatic transformation, for both the Earth and its inhabitants, so it seems only fitting
that the era would go out with a bang. Let’s move forward and find out precisely
what happened to prompt the next era of the Phanerozoic Eon."

How to Memorize Quran like the Sahaba | Quran Memorization Tips - Sh. @AbdulWahabSaleem,"Often we hear that someone somewhere has memorized the entire Quran in just 1 year, or in just a few months. While this is truly a commendable achievement we need to keep in mind that the Sahabas took their time to memorize the Quran. They wouldn't memorize the Quran just for the sake of memorization rather they would properly understand and implement each and every verse before moving on to the next verse. This type of memorization can take many years but in the end, it is what gives the Quran the time and effort that is due to it.

Allah is telling this to the Prophet (sabu) because it was the practice of the Prophet (sabu) in the early days of revelation that when Gabriel (a) would recite to the Prophet (sa) the Prophet (sa) would start repeating the correct recitation with Gabriel.  As of  So Allah told the Prophet (pbuh) not to listen to the correct [Arabic] that Allah told him?  When we recite it to you, listen.  [Arabic] When we recite it to you , listen to that Qur'an and listen to what Gabriel is saying so that you actually understand it.  Because the Mufassirin they said the reason and the wisdom for it is because before you understand something, you cannot really hold it.  So Allah wished the Prophet (pbuh) to know what Gabriel was saying when he was reciting the Qur'an , so that it would be easy for him to retain it, and Allah would allow that Qur'an to remain in the heart of the Prophet.  (PBUH) and the same applies to other people. Today, you know, when people want to recite the Qur'an , and they want to memorize, they go so fast, [Arabic] you don't even understand what they are saying, right?  And then when you ask them, why are you doing this?  They will say I am just doing it for memorization when I actually have time to recite the Qur'an I will say, [Arabic].  right?  Say no, Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says, [Arabic] Do not be hasty with the Qur'an. If you can't memorize in a year that you have set for yourself, take your time because you have no choice but to speed read.  So slow yourself down. Some Companions took whole life to memorize the Quran, others know, some years to memorize, take some time, but don't be too hasty with the Quran, even the Prophet (PBUH) ) if you think it takes 2 years to memorize the Quran.  It took years because of how long it took to come upon him. So wait, slow yourself down.  Make sure you recite the Quran.  Make sure you recite it with Tajweed. Make sure you cite it correctly. Make sure you are reciting.  If you recite the Quran, and your heart does not find the need to understand it.  Then there is a problem because the Prophet (PBUH) was given the Quran for money.  [Arabic] O Messenger, do not hurry with the Qur'an before We complete the revelation to you."

The right of inquiry is the right of the proposing board, it can be a comic, it can be a commission, it can be a combination of members.  So many members then suggested that but maybe not all of them specifically 189 I still remember how many years ago the Century Bank case was only 6.7 trillion, I think at that time it was 189 trillion, plus the others, it was three four nine trillion beyond Normally, if we are serious, the right to inquiry is the way to a better Indonesia.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",WThq6YqUUoE,it was the school shooting that shocked even a country now tragically accustomed to gun violence on campus a six-year-old boy with a gun confronting his first grade teacher inside the classroom and shooting her this week an attorney for the Virginia elementary school teacher who is recovering from gunshot wounds to her hand and chest said the school was warned three separate times the child had a gun so how is it possible that adults let down their students so catastrophically and what is the school saying now NBC's Kathy park has our Sunday Focus active shooter they're in lockdown under where the shooter is at this time another school shooting in America but this one was different from the rest the gunman a six-year-old boy at richneck elementary school in Newport News Virginia when I hear active shooter I think my baby is the first thing is my baby is right there and then you hear it is a baby that did this all I can think is wow how and why those questions still unanswered more than three weeks after authorities say the first grader pulled out a nine millimeter handgun during class and shot his own teacher Abigail's Werner she took a defensive position where she raised her hand the round went through her hand exited the rear of her hand and into her upper chest zwerner critically injured was still able to rush her students to safety I believe she did save lives because I don't know what else might have happened if those kids would have stayed in that room during a press conference zwerner's attorney who's preparing to file a lawsuit against the school district laid out a timeline saying first Werner warned School administrators a boy threatened to beat up another student but nothing was done next at 12 30 a second teacher concerned the boy had a gun searched his backpack and found nothing warning another administrator she believed he put the gun in his pocket then after 1 pm a third teacher warned that the boy in question showed off the gun at recess and threatened to shoot his friend if he told anyone did administrators call the police no did administrators lock down the school no did the administrators evacuate the building no a source close to the situation tells NBC news that an hour before the shooting sworder sent a text to a loved one saying the student was armed and administrators failed to act we do not have details of the full text exchange so it's unclear what was said before or after that text citing an ongoing investigation the school district declined to comment but with the Fallout deepening a district spokesperson says richneck Elementary is under new leadership while the school board voted to fire the superintendent I send my kids to school and find myself praying to God that they will return home safely so many are still struggling to understand how a six-year-old could get a gun police say the boy took it from his home the firearm purchased legally by his mother in all likelihood the six-year-old will not be held criminally responsible the parents could be held responsible if they were criminally negligent in allowing the child access to the firearm and even more so if they knew of the child's dangerous Tendencies the boy's family said the firearm our son access was secured adding that he suffers from an acute disability no charges have been announced but parents like Maria navarrete are demanding accountability do you think this could have been prevented absolutely 100 like so many other parents she's now left wondering when the next tragedy will strike and now I'm just thinking okay well is the next school going to be safe is next year going to be safe and Kathy joins me now live Kathy good morning sir richneck elementary students will return to the classroom tomorrow what is the school doing to keep those kids safe and really to give parents a little confidence maybe that they can trust administrators to protect their children yeah Willie these students have been out of school since January 6 and on Monday they will return to their new reality a heavy police presence and new security upgrades following the shooting administrators say that richneck Elementary along with all schools in the district will be outfitted with a metal detector they're also considering clear backpacks for students and for those who need it on-site support services will be offered throughout the week Willie metal detectors are nice but listening to the warnings may have been more helpful in this case Kathy

Edy Rahmayadi: 2022 We Targeted Sibuhuan - Panyabungan 2 Hours,"PADANGLAWAS - Road access is still a problem in Padanglawas Regency.The Governor of North Sumatra (North Sumatra) Edy Rahmayadi is targeting this problem to be resolved in 2022 through the construction of the Trans Padanglawas-MandailingNatal route.

The Capital City of Padanglawas Regency (Palas), Sibuhuan, is located about 60km with Penyabungan, MandailingNatal Regency (Madina).However, there is currently no adequate road access so that the Palas community must go through the East North Sumatra crossing with a distance of about 6 hours (210km) if you want to go to Penyabungan.With the opening of the Trans Palas-Madina pathway, the distance between Sibuhuan-Penyabungan is approximately 1 hour 30 minutes.

""If this path is good from Sibuhuan to Penyabungan for about one and a half hours, if now have to rotate Padangsidimpuan with approximately 6 hours,"" said Edy Rahmayadi accompanied by the Chairman of the North Sumatra PKK TP Nawal Lubis, after reviewing the alternative path of Sibuhuan-Penyabungan in Hapung Village, Padanglawas, Tuesday (6/15).

This path has actually been opened by Edy Rahmayadi while serving as the 2017 Military Commander I/BB, but stopped.Even so, some people still use this path to the capital city of Madina Regency, Penyabungan using a motorcycle.

Feeling Powerless? Stressed? A Positive Message from Prof Wolff - Economic Update,"Prof Wolff shares why he believes we can make big changes to capitalism even during such a difficult time. It's been done before.

""Quite a few folks have been feeling powerless, not clear about a way forward and yet deeply and increasingly distressed by the rising inequality, the instability, the polarizing political hostilities everywhere, and are upset and rightly so, by right wing impulses and movements that come to the fore and wondering and worrying about a way forward. Is there one? What might it be? I want with you to go through a moment of American history when that kind of feeling was widespread and was overcome."" - Richard Wolff

The presidential office is located in the highest position on a hill in the shape of a garuda karategara bird, of course at the bottom there is the State Palace. In this video we will discuss the presidential office. The presidential office was built facing IKN Nusantara's zero point in front of it is the state palace and the presidential office ceremonial field in pure Indonesian cloth designed and built by the nation's own children. The presidential office is designed in the shape of a Garuda bird flapping its wings. The selection of students is based on the fact that the Garuda bird represents the entire Indonesian nation because the Garuda bird  is the national symbol of the Garuda Palace. It will be built from a steel frame and shell made of copper. Brass galialung and glass. The Presidential Palace complex, including the President's office, has an area of 100 hectares, only 8% of the building area, while the remaining 92% will be arranged into parks and green open spaces specifically for the large presidential office.  the built area is 3.5 hectares with a 4-story building, the height of the shell or envelope is 60 m with a width including wing spans of 200 meters. The President's office will be carried out by PT Pembangunan Perumahan or PT PP with funds of 1.56 trillion from the APBN. Currently the building foundation is almost complete.  The entire foundation is strengthened by drilling a file drill into the center of the earth or using a foundation for the purpose of file drilling, there are two first to become the legs of the main pillar of the building, the second to become a retaining wall for the PowerPoint wall, done close to each other, then after completion, the top ends are joined together with concrete.  horizontally then the outer side is excavated so that it becomes a retaining wall to continue the file drill. With the main pillar, a stamp file or connection shoe is made. The main pillar is what makes the upper structure of the presidential office building stand. Currently, the installation of iron for the stamp file is being carried out if we take a picture from the side.  On the right, the retaining wall that borders the ground floor of the presidential office building has been formed. This structure will support the inner wall of the presidential office. The inner wall of the presidential office actually has two walls. The inner wall is like an ordinary multi-storey building, while the outer wall is also known as a sheath or wall shell.  This exterior is in the shape of an eagle, the presidential office building is unique because it combines the world of construction with the world of sculpture because the basic design of the presidential office was made by a sculptor, Nyoman Warteg, who was the designer. The presidential office is targeted for completion before August 17 2024 because at that time the government  plans to move the capital to IKN Nusantara and the government is optimistic that this target will be achieved [Music]"

So the big coalition is getting bigger but increasingly telling one thing, whether Pedi struggle is part of a big quality scenario or whether it is beyond question in what position the struggle fairy can be. joining and in What this struggle looks like can be beyond quality depending on two things. The first depends on how strong your electability is. So if you are still weak like now then it is possible that you will want to struggle and quality. Because after all, Anieswedan is considered not a threat if the trend is still weak, but if  You are suitable and your electability is experiencing a rebound and then occupying a competitive ranking or even overtaking, for example, the first and second places, maybe there is solidarity between parties supporting the government to form a super big quality by inviting them to become an integral part of the struggle, the first and the second depending on the agreement between Mr. Prabowo in it is Gerindra with Mrs. Mega and PDI, however the struggle is the winning party that can advance without having to enter into a coalition with other parties. Well, if for example there is an agreement regarding the presidential and vice presidential candidates between these two important actors, then it is very possible that there will be a super big quality by entering into trading.  the struggle in it and Mr. Prabowo and Ganjar Pranowo will be a duet, not a duel, but if there is no agreement then there may be three axes, the Andas Prabowo Subianto axis and the old Ganjar axis, but again, this second point is still far from being roasted than the fire waiting for the constellation, especially at the level  Today's electron, the Indonesian Survey Institute has just released the results where Mr. Prabowo overtook Ganjar Prano's electability, so the question is, is this latest electoral development causing discussion among the elite, so the struggle with Mr. Prabowo and Gerindra is the time that will test my guess, it will be left to the end.  The registration process will take place around September-October before it will be decided whether the super big coalition is finished or not"

These few days of fasting, I feel it is difficult to carry out because I often swallow phlegm when it has been expelled. Mahroj will but the problem is still at the end of my throat, my phlegm often comes out continuously, more often in the morning, so usually around 11.00 or it has been canceled because I have swallowed the phlegm at the end of my throat. Sometimes the phlegm when the machine tries to expel it feels like it won't come out.  but when I swallow it feels like I have phlegm, I feel like I have swallowed phlegm. How is this, ma'am, can I use another madhhab for this? I often produce phlegm even though I have broken the fast, so much so that I take cough medicine. Thank you for the first bike ride I took.  for you to still stick with the Syafi'i madhhab with its conveniences, then if not, we can give you another eye in the Syafi'i madhhab with its conveniences, for example mindaha then the phlegm that has come out of the makhraj is hot or comes out Hai then don't swallow it again and the eyes are indeed Syafi'  i even this midday, if you swallow it again, cancel it, it comes out from the inside, from the inside it comes out, if you swallow it, it usually cancels it, cancel it, it's already lovebird, how come it comes out, it means family, what if it's a family, what does it mean when it's about to be expelled easily, that's what comes out Hi, but you, but from the sentence we heard  it's hard to get out then when I help you feel like if it's hard to get out it hasn't come out yet Hi Uncle just get it out sucah means it hasn't come out yet and it's finished it's hard to get out then you're not old enough to try Hi it doesn't break your fast even if it's in the Shafi'i madhhab Why is it in the Syafi'i madhhab  that's the hara that makes it invalid which is already out but what's hard to get out is hard to get out means it hasn't come out yet therefore the original al-aqsa is inside while it's hard to get out it means it's not coming out then you need to think about it later this is in hip hop Syafi'i from Solo you still Maybe there are also people who are tested with Masya Allah, they are like a phlegm factory, it just doesn't end, the Wardah comes out a lot and to the point of exhaustion, he wants to pray the Isha prayer, he doesn't pray this prayer, sir, yes, it's called a human, right? That's a special type of illness for people like this, of course.  If you still hold on and get stuck, the prayer will also be a mess because the phlegm will break the fast and also break the prayer. Hi, if you break the fast, if you swallow the prayer bar, cancel the fast, then if you cancel the prayer and the prayer, you can get confused later, in this case, Hi, if it's a case where the phlegm is excessive, there are symptoms.  flu is usually excessive like this, it's a money motive then wakwakwakwakwak and that's why there are schools of thought Imam Malik Rahimahullah is special for people who blame social If you can do whatever you want you can stick to m Syafei again it can be normal this is not normal Rusda Just in the form of continuous and  It's also not nice if you waste a little money, so according to Hakim Malik Rahimullah Ta'ala, even though it's on the tip of our tongues, men don't break the fast, this is convenience because sir, it's not something that eating, not filming, enjoying, not filming is considered delicious.  It's not his idea to turn around and ignore no problem. So for those who have a case, we don't want to bother ordinary people with fasting. So it's all a hassle because the phlegm stays void and then the frogs will poop when they do. Doctor Usage. No fasting, he's slime, but Malik Rahimahullah Ta'ala until it is said that even though it is already on the tip of the tongue, it's not just here that if you call again, then in fact it doesn't break the fast. Special edition for those of you who have problems, it's no problem, just stick to Imam Syafi'i's method and Allah Ta'ala's bread jumhur. Amen.  yes"

Tomorrow diminishes the significance of the air that you're breathing right now. It tells you that someday you can begin your journey and that you can just wait and make yourself comfortable until then. Tomorrow masks itself is an escape for those held down by fear, those resistant to change. It encourages you to be content where you are. Stating that you have your whole life to get where you want to be and for some tomorrow lasts forever. It evolves into regret, into a mobility, into an excuse to never really do what you were meant to do. Tomorrow can be worse than failing because often it implies that there was never a beginning. There was just a vision. Just an idea being put off for a better time that never came. There will never be a moment in your life. More precious than the one you're living in. Your heart beating in your chest, the air in your lungs, the blood in your veins. They're giving you an opportunity to make a change. To become who you want to become, to live, to inspire, to achieve. Because who really knows how many tomorrows you'll get? In the last thing you want is to look back on your life thousands of Days from now. In wish you had the courage to do what you wanted to do. To wish that you understood, how fast tomorrow's come and go And that all you will ever have is the present moment. Every Journey starts with a step. That courageous act of moving forward, not knowing, what tomorrow will bring. Only knowing that you'll be further along then than you are now. That you'll be stronger, wiser, smarter. Because you didn't wait for tomorrow. You didn't wait for anything. And that is the difference between I am and I wish I was. It is the difference between dreaming and truly living."

Therefore, those working in the field in detail must really look at it so that it can be repaired.  from management last year, the homecoming flow must be better and I really appreciate what has been done at Merak Port, so it is conveyed that there is an addition to Pier 2 Port and there is also a quite significant increase in capacity from 34 thousand to 49,000, a quite large jump in numbers.  because we know that 86,000 people will be returning home this year, this year it is estimated from the survey results that there will be 123 million from 86 million to 123 million. Therefore, additional capacity and additional docks are very important and earlier I also saw that the management is very detailed about which ports used for heavy vehicles, which port is used for motorized vehicles and which port is used for small and large vehicles, the management method is very good, but later we will see what the management is like in the field, because if we remember last year, there was a big problem in upper power and lower power side. Are the improvements we have made really able to eliminate the problems that have occurred in the last year? Then secondly, apart from Merak, it is also related to toll roads and looking at the number of rest areas which in the last year were very disturbing, the number has also been increased.  and we hope that in addition to the Ministry of Transportation, the National Police, the TNI will ask the BUMN to ask the governor, regent, mayor, to really go down to see the problem in detail so that they can execute it directly in the field because I can't imagine jumping from 86 million to 123 million, that's not management.  which is easy, requires preparation, requires good planning design and is very hopeful. Why am I here? I want to ensure that everything we hope will go well and the community will really serve it well, no one will feel like they are hanging around on the road for a long time at the port  there's a traffic jam that's what I think we expect. I think that's an introduction, thank you"

I am here to ensure that the planning design preparations are in a ready position. [Music] using this ship is correct. We haven't seen many people yet, so my prediction is that in the past years it will be increased because last year I was a bit hampered when I came home, especially in getting into the vehicle, but with this year the diversion for two-wheeled vehicles won't happen. one with the one at Merak Harbor. Well, that's very beneficial for motorists who drive a car. So far, we have prepared this, so it's very ready and God willing, it will run smoothly because 2 ports are open too. In my opinion, make sure you get it. This surge means people have to go home, so that's why the two ports were opened to clear them up so there won't be any serious traffic jams. My hope is that every year it will increase, it will be even better, so every time there is a homecoming for Eid or something else there won't be any traffic jams.  again [Music]"

Lyrics

Sweet memories of you and me
Will not be eradicated
Thorns mines in love
The world

Love to love
Love is remembered
Feeling of being longing
Ohhhh ...

Look at my losing
Without your love dear
Who am I

Love to love
Believing
The root cause of love
Ohhh ... oh ...

Why should we be in dispute
Because of slander and misunderstanding
What has happened to the memories
Of course I've never forgotten
Why still there is a feeling of hate
Because of love and believe in losing in feelings

Let's love
We love each other
If only there were hate
We back up to the memories
Ohhh ... ohhh ... ohh

Without your love dear

Ohh.ohh.ohh.

Why should we be in dispute
Because of slander and misunderstanding
What has happened to the memories
Of course I've never forgotten
Why still there is a feeling of hate
Because of love and believe in losing in feelings
What should we do
We back up to the memories

Why should we be in dispute
Because of slander and misunderstanding
What has happened to the memories
Of course I've never forgotten
Why still there is a feeling of hate
Because of love and believe in losing in feelings

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",4irwUQXHhLA,[Music] Hey listen if you don't want to be happier please do not subscribe to this channel but if you're interested in more joy check out this clip so what what when the when the mind when the intellect is focused on the negative on all the things that are wrong what exactly happens to the soul that makes that Soul more uh responsive to the evil one is it despair that occurs or is it does that's part of it that's it and what else I think that's part of it I think no what's happening is you're starting to replicate their own psychology it's a demonic psychology yeah I mentioned a little bit earlier you know we talk about this compatibility between because so once a per demon possesses somebody or gets into their life he starts setting about trying to drive certain kinds of vices and thinking patterns that conform to his own thinking patterns so that it's easier to get you to do the things that he wants you to do what happens is in relationship to the um to the uh to when people get into a negative pattern of thinking is that it starts replicating that exact same negative pattern that they have because as I mentioned all the demons in hell are focused on any they don't have a positive thought now wow and so all you're doing is you're becoming like that and so just becoming like that setting up or opening up the door to that psychological compatibility is just going to attract them and they're going to start driving that to gain greater control and influence over him and then it starts here's the here's the mystery of sin and vice that starts to feel good to people yes it does why would something that brings them down feel good um I actually talk about that in my book of psychology St Thomas says there's two parts to it the first is is that um the body adjusts itself to the operations of the soul and we know this right so if you see some guy who weighs 300 pounds and he's sitting on a couch and says I want to want a marathon you're like getting happening right right so what does he got to do he's got to get up he's got to start exercising it's going to take a long time and then eventually the body begins to adjust to the fact where he can run 26 miles but it's going to take time so but the dog's got to adjust it the same is even true in virtue and vice so the body begins to adjust itself to be able to sustain higher levels of virtue and even higher level or even more levels of disorder and so what happens is Saint Thomas is when we act in accord with our bodily disposition so if we've committed a lot of vices then when we act in accordance with advice he says when we act in accordance with our disposition we get a pleasure out of it when we act contrary to our disposition it's painful and we know that from our own experience that when we start fasting or doing starting to overcome advice it's painful right but then as time goes on then it starts the body begins itself and it actually becomes delightful to perform the action the other part is something that Aristotle said which is as you go in virtue then what happens is the action as you perform the action that's in accord with virtue then what happens is that you get an actual Delight in the faculty in performing that act at act the same is also true about Vice you know I just got the image of a herniated disc yeah it starts to bend you over it does exactly you straighten out it hurts that's right that's what you need to do you need to squish the disc back that's right a physical therapist so you just go do the opposite Bend and that's right then it starts to feel great after a while that's right yeah wow and so that's that is part of the is the fact that people eventually start to get Delight out of Performing things that are evil wow are you a fan of The Lord of the Rings very much so yeah so the palantir I just love the Paleteria you're saying this the uh they think that by looking into the stone they'll figure out the evil one's plans and then they their mind conforms to the evil one yeah it's the exact yeah you should spend a gift Christian you you need to spend more time in the in the good news than the breaking news exactly exactly that takes work it does take work because there's the the satisfaction of curiosity yeah for all of us well and just because of the effects of original actual sin we all have a tendency towards spiritual sloth it's just not work it's hard work and so we just want something that's comfortable and if you're comfortable in your spiritual life actually a lot of people who are negative or very comfortable in their spiritual life but if you come from a spiritual life that's not a good sign all right the devil will back right off yeah wow yeah that's the the big spiritual uh deadly sin of our age is that is that sloth and everybody feels so busy that's right you know but but it's not spiritual work I think most young people lose Faith because they're they're just so they don't ask questions of Faith that's correct content with living at this depth and not knowing them well and not knowing their faith well this is something that we run up against quite a bit a lot of the people that come to us who need spiritual help to get out of what's it's because of the fact that a lot of times they just lack basic catechesis you know I didn't know that living with my boyfriend was a problem you know man wasn't that great I get so much out of these conversations I know you will too be sure to hit subscribe and share the show with everybody you know we'll see in the next video [Music]

"Foreign Minister Ukraine underestimated the importance of counterattacks, insisting to end the war with a ceasefire","TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM-Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmitro Kuleba revealed a different view related to Russian-Ukraine conflict.

According to him, the strategy to carry out a counterattack is not the best solution to win.

Kueba believes that the conflict of the two countries can end with a ceasefire.

He said, a counterattack launched by the Ukraine military could not necessarily drive out Russian troops.

Moreover, the Ukraine territory which is now controlled by Russia is so vast.

""We have to fight with all means of a counterattack perception as a decisive battle battle,"" Kuleba said, quoted from RT, Friday (3/31).

Kueba's view is contrary to the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky.

The leader of Ukraine insisted that the only choice being considered was to reclaim all regions claimed by Russia.

After that goal is achieved, then peace talks can be done.

Although he did not agree with a counterattack, Kueba continued to support weapons assistance from the West.

Because, Ukraine still needs tools to survive the onslaught of enemies.

As is known, Russian and Ukraine conflicts have been going on for more than a year.

But the two countries have not shown signs of peace.

In fact, a fierce battle that killed hundreds of soldiers still occurred in the city of Bakhmut.

Robin Van Persie: 'I told my son he sounded like a loser',"Robin van Persie, born 6 August 1983, is a Dutch football coach and former professional footballer who played as a striker. Regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation, Van Persie was known for his excellent technique and ball control, intelligent positioning, and vision. He is the all-time top scorer for the Netherlands national team. He is currently an assistant manager at boyhood club Feyenoord in his first managerial role.

Starting his career as a winger, Van Persie made his senior debut for Feyenoord during the 2001–02 season, which culminated with victory in the 2002 UEFA Cup Final; he was also named as the Dutch Football Talent of the Year. After five years with Feyenoord, he fell out with manager Bert van Marwijk, and he joined English club Arsenal in 2004 as a long-term replacement for compatriot Dennis Bergkamp. Van Persie was converted to a striker by manager Arsène Wenger and went on to be a consistent goal scorer for Arsenal. He scored a club record of 35 goals in 2011 and was club captain for the 2011–12 season, prior to joining rivals Manchester United in July 2012. In his first season, he won the Premier League and his second consecutive Premier League Golden Boot.

After two injury-hit seasons followed, Van Persie fell out of favour at United and he was allowed to leave for Fenerbahçe in July 2015. During his spell in Turkey, Van Persie featured regularly in his first season, but saw limitations in playing time in the following two campaigns after suffering with injuries, with both club and player agreeing to a buyout in January 2018, after which he re-joined Feyenoord on a free transfer. By the end of the season he had helped his boyhood team win the Dutch Cup, his first trophy since the 2013 FA Community Shield.

After representing the Netherlands at under-17, under-19 and under-21 level, Van Persie made his senior international debut in 2005 in a friendly match against Romania. A month later, he scored his first senior international goal in a 4–0 win over Finland. Van Persie has over 100 caps and scored 50 goals for the Netherlands, and from 2013 to 2015 he was the team's captain. He has represented his country at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, and the 2008 and 2012 UEFA European Championships.

"Shiveluch Volcano Eruption Update; Large & Sustained Explosive Eruption, Widespread Ashfall","The most explosive volcano in Russia just produced its largest eruption in 30 years, sending a several hours long and sustained plume of ash to a height of more than 50,000 feet for more than 6 hours. As a result, large pyroclastic flows were generated from Shiveluch and significant swaths of Kamchatka were coated in a layer of as much as 10 centimeters thick of ash. What had just occurred was a sub-plinian eruption from a volcano which famously produced a large partial collapse and debris avalanche during a 1964 eruption.

Note: The evacuation radius/exclusion zone is purely hypothetical and based only off of the opinion of GeologyHub based on the situation at Sheveluch and no other volcanoes on April 11 2023 and does not represent a government or agency opinion. 
Update on April 14, 2023. In my opinion the maximum exclusion zone should now be 20 kilometers instead of 35 kilometers. This is also not an official government or agency opinion.
Update on April 22, 2023. In my opinion the maximum exclusion zone should now be 15 kilometers instead of 20 kilometers. This is also not an official government or agency opinion.

a major explosive eruption occurred at the Sheveluch volcano in Russia, representing
the Kamchatka peninsula's most powerful eruption in 30 years. As a section of Sheveluch's lava dome exploded,
it sent a sustained plume of ash to a height of 54,000 feet or 16.5 kilometers, with the
possibility that a section of the plume reached even higher. Due to the sheer amounts of ash ejected into
the atmosphere, hundreds and perhaps thousands of lightning strikes then occurred in rapid
succession, lighting up the sky which otherwise turned a gray color. As this ash rich gray plume drifted to the
west, ash quickly piled up, reaching more than 10 centimeters thick in some areas, essentially
covering everything in a thick brown layer. This sustained eruption continued at a high
rate for at least 6 hours, before finally becoming intermittent and then going back
to weaker eruptive activity. What had just occurred was a sub-plinian eruption
of the Sheveluch volcano. Before I continue, I want to give my opinion
on the dangerous situation at this volcano. I do not work for the Russian government and
do not have the authority to order any evacuations. With this being said, in my opinion you should
for the time being not be within a 15 kilometer radius of Sheveluch's active lava dome in
all directions, expanding to 35 kilometers between 192 and 339 degrees if straight east
represents 0 degrees and north represents 90 degrees. As you can see, the Sheveluch volcano has
two large collapse scars opened towards the south and south-southwest. The area I have labeled is the active lava
dome so any eruptive products or superheated gas currents will originate from there. Thus, if this vent was to suddenly produce
another major eruption, any pyroclastic flows it would generate would for the most part
travel within the confines of its two major collapse scars. Only the largest pyroclastic flows might spill
over these walls but would be unlikely to travel more than 15 kilometers. On the other hand, pyroclastic flows, lateral
blast deposits, and large debris avalanches caused by sections of this volcano collapsing
have reached up to 34 kilometers distant during eruptions since the end of the last Ice Age. You can tell this via numerous rounded hills
which seem out of place on the southern flanks of this volcano. These hills are referred to as ""hummocky terrain""
and are a telltale sign of a debris avalanche having occurred at least once before, much
like these hummocks which originated 340,000 years ago at Mount Shasta. And yes, I will acknowledge that it is highly
unlikely the current eruption or any activity in the next week will reach 35 kilometers
distant. Rather, 35 kilometers is what in my opinion
I deem to be a mostly safe radius in case of a worst case scenario eruption. For context, Sheveluch during the Holocene
epoch aka the last 11,700 years has been the single most explosive volcano on the planet
when you count the number of eruptions it has produced that were at least on the same
order of magnitude as the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens as it has produced 15 of
these. Based on early indications, I am suggesting
that the latest eruption registered in on the volcanic explosivity index scale as a
3, perhaps even being a low 4 although I consider the latter to be less likely. I had previously reported on early warning
signs of a near future major explosive eruption at this volcano all the way back on November
22nd 2022. Although Sheveluch was already erupting at
the time, it underwent a rapid increase in thermal signatures visible from satellite
suggesting that a new and large gas rich body of magma was intruding into the volcano. Yet, these increased signatures then returned
to normal levels. I thus believe that the highly volatile and
gas rich shallow body of magma was still present but remained trapped under the more than 1,000
foot thick viscous lava dome, and built up over the timespan of 6 months before finally
breaking overlying rock and causing this eruption. Thus, I fully expect a small section of Sheveluch's
primary lava dome to be missing, perhaps with a new 100ish meter wide explosion crater carved
into it. Thanks for watching. If you would like to request a specific topic,

This was reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing a secret US document leaked on social media regarding this. Will Ukraine surrender in May? The US secret document states that since February 28 Ukraine  already produces around 69 book missiles and 200 S300 missiles per month. Therefore, it is claimed that the gift army will run out of book ammunition by the end of this week and will use up the S300 supply by May 3. Sourcing missiles for this Soviet-made platform has proven difficult for gif and its western supporters, however.  This does not make Ukraine give up the war with Russia because gif has received 3 German anti-aircraft systems and 8 German iriste but these systems consume about 64 missiles per month and their limited number cannot cover as much territory as the Ukrainian S300 to make up for this shortfall.  The American military estimates that Ukraine needs 16 Iristee batteries or Nasams and 12 Patriot batteries or Somet knowing that US President Joko has authorized the deployment of one Patriot battery while Germany has promised another and France and Italy have promised one system somethi free so the US has not confirmed related leaks  This data means that the truth regarding this matter cannot be ascertained.

"Criticism about human rights, Vanuatu apparently did not join the convention about the elimination of race discrimination","Newyork, KOMPASTV Diplomat RI Silvany Austin Pasaribu said the Vanuatu State was not yet validated by the International Convention on the Elimination of Race Discrimination for his country.

He explained this Sylivany in using the right of responsibility in the UN General Assembly Session to refute the accusations posted by PM Vanuatu, Bob Loughman about the issue of Papua.

Silvany said Indonesia had passed the international convention on the elimination of race discrimination and was listed in the Republic of Indonesia Law Number 29 of 1999.

Related to this, Silvany revealed that the Vanuatu state had never signed the international convention.

""We have approved the international convention on the elimination of race discrimination and the interest of Vanuatu has never signed it,"" Silvany said on the UN YouTube account, Sunday (9/27/2020)

Furthermore, Silvany was also confused by Vanuatu's attitude, and questioned the concern of the government to the indigenous people there.

""He has never signed an international agreement on the rights of social and cultural economic as the core of this human rights instrument is the question of whether they really care about the indigenous people,"" Silvany said

Silvany clearly revealed that Vanuatu had never signed and ratified a convention that opposed torture and cruelty in agreements or punishment that was demeaning.

Former general chairman of the Democratic Party  The former member of the General Election Commission was involved in the Hambalang corruption case. The Supreme Court decided to review Anas Urbaningrum's case in the Hambalang Athlete's House project corruption case and money laundering with a sentence of 8 years in prison or lower.  rather than the cassation level decision which sentenced him to 18 years in prison in the PK decision Ma sentenced Anas to 8 years in prison and a fine of 300 million rupiah subsidiary 3 months to pay compensation of 57.59 billion rupiah and 5.26 million United States Dollars and revocation of political rights for 5 years in  The consideration is that the PK panel accepted the basis of Anas' petition regarding the Judge's error in the cassation decision for Anas in the Hambalang case which had political nuances, therefore after he was released he would open up about the Hambalang case and whoever was involved in the Hambalang case, for example, whether it was really over or whether it was actually ended.  That's it, that's a problem too. But he's not here yet, so I know very well about the process. For example, I thought that during the examination, it was a bit funny, it was also a problem with the congress, right? But the head of the elementary school was not questioned, the chairman of the board of trustees was not questioned to explain how.  The incident that happened later there will be revealed and it's not just a matter of a short leak which was a problem with the black history of the Corruption Eradication Committee at that time. It was leaked. Then the leak of a symbol of power was already a language that was not independent at that time, it was indeed subject to the revocation of political rights to vote and be elected.  in the election, but for political activities, Ana is ready to join in strengthening the Nusantara PKN revival party which is led by her friend Gede Pasexual and she will reveal all aspects of what happened in the past so that people understand that yesterday is not as holy as imagined, Anas will explain it.  together with PKN has the potential to prolong the feud against the Democratic party led by Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono"

Perry was a rideshare driver who just dropped off a customer down where the protests were happeni, and testimony said he was surrod by demonstrators, including Fos, who was holding a rifle.

Abraham Samad reported Firli Bahuri for the alleged leakage of confidential documents for KPK investigators,"TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Former KPK Chairperson, Abraham Samad reported the Chairman of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) Firli Bahuri.

This report is demanding a alleged leakage of confidential documents for KPK investigators, carried out by Firli Bahuri.

Reporting from Wartakotalive.com, Abraham Samad has also reported alleged violations of Ethics and Crimes Firli Bahari to the KPK Supervisory Board (Dewas).

But it is not sure if Dewas will take action against Firli.

While his party felt that he had to really encourage the alleged criminal acts of Firli to be processed.

Therefore, Abraham Samad along with a number of former KPK leaders will report Firli Bahuri to the National Police.

Firli revealed that it would be done as soon as possible.

""Soon, soon, soon in this short time, no later than tomorrow (report Firli to the police),"" Samad said when met by the media crew at the Old KPK Building, Monday (10/4/2023).

Abraham Samad rate, Firli Bahuri must be responsible for his actions in a criminal manner for allegedly leaking KPK documents.

According to him, if the legal apparatus worked professionally, they did not need a long time to set Firli as a suspect in the alleged crime of leakage of documents.

""So maybe he could qualify in ethics if Dewas did not work objectively but this time Firli could not escape the criminal responsibility,"" said Samad.

As for this leaked document, Samad suspected that it was not an investigation warrant.

But a complete document resembles the results of the investigation.

Where in the document, various strategies are included in the corruption and a number of substantial issues of corruption cases.

""There is a complete document in it that is actually the result of the investigation.So it's dangerous, ""Abraham Samad said.

""Therefore, law enforcement officials should not be playing games, because this is an extraordinary event in my opinion, it cannot be tolerated,"" he said again.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for KPK institutional action, Ali Fikri admitted, his party respected a number of parties who reported alleged ethical violations to Dewas.

According to him, according to his main task, the KPK Dewas will follow up the report professionally according to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and not be affected by any party.

""We certainly really appreciate some of the parties who report the dynamics and issues of alleged document leakage to Dewas,"" Ali said in his written statement on Monday.

For information, Abraham Samad took part in a demonstration at the Red and White Building of the KPK Office on Monday (10/4/2023) with a number of former KPK Chairman Saut Situmorang.

At that time Samad and Saut came with dozens of mass of action consisting of various civil society groups at 13.49 WIB.

Besides Samad and Saut, it appears that the Executive Director of Amnesty International Indonesia, Usman Hamid, former Deputy Minister of Law and Human Rights (Wamenkumham) Denny Indrayana, and Indonesian Corruption Watch (ICW) researcher, Kurnia Ramadhana.

In addition, there was also a former KPK Advisor Abdullah Hemahahua, and a former KPK investigator who had been fired because he was declared not to pass the National Insight Test (TWK).

They brought a poster that read 'Alleged Case Leaks, Firli must be removed', 'The Future of the KPK is more important than the future of Firli', and others.

One of the masses of action also wore Firli Bahuri's face mask with a necklace that reads ethical violators.

with China, a military spokesman said Tuesday. Colonel Michael Logico, the Filipino 
spokesman for the drills said: ""More than   17,000 troops will participate in 
the drills from April 11 to 28,   during which the allies will for the first

will be 17,600 participants on   our side and on the side of the U.S. This is 
officially the largest Balikatan exercise”. About 12,000 U.S. military personnel 
will participate in the 38th version   of Balikatan while most of the 
others will be Philippine troops. This will be the first annual exercise under the 
government of President Ferdinand Marcos Junior,   which in February granted U.S. 
troops expanded access to military   sites as regional tensions rise over the 
Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. The exercises also come on the heels of China’s   growing assertiveness in the 
disputed South China region. Last month, Manila filed a diplomatic 
protest with Beijing after the China   Coast Guard trained a military-grade laser 
on a Philippine Coast Guard ship near the   Philippine-occupied Ayungin Shoal (or the 
international name is Second Thomas Shoal). Logico said the beefed-up exercises were not a   direct response to the incident but were

every country has the absolute and   inalienable right to exercise within 
our territory. We have an absolute,   inalienable right to defend our 
territory. That's all I can say.” China and the Philippines have overlapping 
claims in the South China Sea. Taiwan, Brunei,   Malaysia and Vietnam have their 
own claims that counter China’s. In February, a U.S. Army official told 
the Associated Press news agency that   Beijing’s increasing assertiveness in the disputed   South China Sea was “absolutely” on 
participants’ minds when they train. On Sunday, Beijing accused Washington of stirring   up trouble in the region and driving a 
wedge between China and the Philippines. The Chinese embassy in Manila said that 
contrary to accusations by the Philippines,   U.S. and other countries, freedom of navigation 
in the South China Sea has not been impeded. It also said that granting the U.S. 
greater access to Philippine military   bases would drag the Southeast Asian 
nation into “geopolitical strife,”   claiming the move is part of a plot to 
contain its growing regional influence. This year, 111 troops from the Australian Defense 
Force will be participating in the exercise,   particularly in small land-based 
special operations training,   Balikatan spokesman Logico said. Japan, another country that has a territorial   quarrel with China, will be 
sending observers to the event. The Exercise will be held at Fort 
Magsaysay in northern Nueva Ecija province,   in Casiguran town in Aurora province, and 
in the provinces of Palawan and Antique. The U.S. is scheduled to bring a Patriot missile 
system and high mobility artillery rocket systems,   or HIMARs, adding it is to bring ships and 
aircraft without giving specific details. The Philippine military, meanwhile, 
will feature two frigates from the navy,   FA-50 jets from the air force, and 
newly acquired artillery from the army. The previous largest Balikatan in 2015 
included 6,500 U.S. and 5,000 Philippine   troops. The 2022 exercises involved 8,900

Helion's approach to fusion: How it works,"An explanation of Helion’s pulsed, non-ignition approach to fusion power generation. Leveraging Faraday’s Law of Induction, Helion directly recovers electricity from fusion plasmas without the need for steam turbines. 

By forming, accelerating, and merging two Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) plasmas in its sixth fusion device, Trenta, Helion successfully reached plasma temperatures exceeding 9 keV (104 million degrees Celsius). Now, Helion’s focus is on Polaris, its seventh fusion device, which will be the first fusion device to demonstrate net electricity from fusion.

LYRICS:

Snow looks white, 'cause it's scattering light elastically.
Atoms are everywhere I look, though none of them can be seen. Molecules have always been a challenge to resolve.
Light microscopes don't work, heaven knows we tried.

Do they exist? Can they be seen?
Maybe using some spectroscopy!
For centuries, we didn't know. Well now...we know!

Chemists know, Chemists know
What makes water freeze and flow.
Chemists know, Chemists know,
Why fireflies can glow.

All chemists know Avogadro,
Order ten to twenty-three.
(the moles never bothered me anyway.)

Angstroms measure distance,
Nomenclature hard to say,
Though are macroscopic, we always find a way!

We love to see what we can do,
Synthesizing novel molecules,
From Exclusion Principle of Pauli:
CHEMISTRY!

Chemists know, Chemists know
About ozone in the sky
Chemists know, Chemists know
Sigma bonding vs. Pi

We understand Le Chatelier
Equilibrium!

There's chemistry to be found,
From the air down to the ground.
We make these compounds form
In flasks with bottoms that are round.

We hope they crystalize, 
'Cause columns are the worst!
Still we strive to do all this,
For the chance to be the first!

Chemists know, Chemists know
Why it's red at the break of dawn
Chemists know, Chemists know
Where reactants go when they're gone.

We need to know
Every single way
To form or break BONDS!

For the Rest of My Life - LYRICS

I praise Allah for sending me you my love
You've found your home it's here with me, and I'm here with you 
Now let me let you know
You've opened my heart 
I was always thinking that love was wrong
But everything was changed when you came along, oh
And there's a couple of words I want to say

Chorus:
For the rest of my life, I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side, honest and true
Till the end of my time, I'll be loving you, loving you
For the rest of my life, through days and nights 
I'll thank Allah for opening my eyes 
Now and forever I, I'll be there for you
I know it deep in my heart 

I feel so blessed when I think of you
And I ask Allah to bless all we do
You're my wife, and my friend and my strength
And I pray we're together in Jannah
Finally now I've found my self, I feel so strong 
Yes everything was changed when you came along, oh
And there's a couple of words I want to say

Chorus 

And now that you're here, in front of me
I strongly feel love
And I have no doubt, and I'll sing it loud
And that I will love you eternally

Chorus

"Discussing War in Ukraine, Emmanuel Macron failed to influence & urge Xi Jinping to hostile to Russia","TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Chinese President Xi Jinping was not moved by the rhetoric of French President Emmanuel Macron about conflicts in Ukraine.

The pressure that France tried to spread on China to be hostile to Russia, did not seem to have much effect.

Previously, he told French reporters that 'anyone who helped the aggressor would become an accomplice that violated international law'.

Quoted from the Russia Today page, Saturday (8/4/2023), Xi responded by saying China 'was willing to be with France begging the international community to remain rational and calm' and repeat the position of China in the conflict.

Macron violated the protocol by speaking almost twice longer than Xi, and turned to demands that China condemned the 'War launched by Russia against Ukraine'.

According to Politico, Xi Jinping 'looks impatient and annoyed' when Macron spoke, and 'sighed deeply' when the discussion about Ukraine.

Previously, Macron announced the trip to China right after Xi Jinping spent three days in Moscow, Russia.

Xi Jinping signed a series of agreements with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

At one point, he was heard telling Putin that the two countries they led would encourage changes that had never been seen by the world for more than a century.

Meanwhile, 'The problem of piling up at Macron's house', the strike of sanitation workers makes France buried in garbage that is not collected.

In addition, mass protests against retirement reforms that he imposed through the decree continued throughout France.

The new poll shows Macron's political rival, the Marine Le Pen is now more popular.

Macron is scheduled to travel from Beijing to Guangzhou with Xi Jinping on Friday local time for further discussion and personal dinner.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who was brought by Macron to 'display European unity' also met with Xi Jinping on Thursday, but was not included in many bilateral meetings.

Appearing at a press conference alone on Thursday night, Von Der Leyen repeated the points of the conversation between the European Union without paying much attention to his host.

He brought up Taiwan, said that every threat of violence to change his status was 'unacceptable'.

This European Union official also believes that giving weapons to Russia will significantly damage relations between the EU and China '.

He hopes that China 'plays its role and promotes a fair peace, which respects the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine'.

"Discussing War in Ukraine, Emmanuel Macron failed to influence & urge Xi Jinping to hostile to Russia","TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Chinese President Xi Jinping was not moved by the rhetoric of French President Emmanuel Macron about conflicts in Ukraine.

The pressure that France tried to spread on China to be hostile to Russia, did not seem to have much effect.

Previously, he told French reporters that 'anyone who helped the aggressor would become an accomplice that violated international law'.

Quoted from the Russia Today page, Saturday (8/4/2023), Xi responded by saying China 'was willing to be with France begging the international community to remain rational and calm' and repeat the position of China in the conflict.

Macron violated the protocol by speaking almost twice longer than Xi, and turned to demands that China condemned the 'War launched by Russia against Ukraine'.

According to Politico, Xi Jinping 'looks impatient and annoyed' when Macron spoke, and 'sighed deeply' when the discussion about Ukraine.

Previously, Macron announced the trip to China right after Xi Jinping spent three days in Moscow, Russia.

Xi Jinping signed a series of agreements with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

At one point, he was heard telling Putin that the two countries they led would encourage changes that had never been seen by the world for more than a century.

Meanwhile, 'The problem of piling up at Macron's house', the strike of sanitation workers makes France buried in garbage that is not collected.

In addition, mass protests against retirement reforms that he imposed through the decree continued throughout France.

The new poll shows Macron's political rival, the Marine Le Pen is now more popular.

Macron is scheduled to travel from Beijing to Guangzhou with Xi Jinping on Friday local time for further discussion and personal dinner.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who was brought by Macron to 'display European unity' also met with Xi Jinping on Thursday, but was not included in many bilateral meetings.

Appearing at a press conference alone on Thursday night, Von Der Leyen repeated the points of the conversation between the European Union without paying much attention to his host.

He brought up Taiwan, said that every threat of violence to change his status was 'unacceptable'.

This European Union official also believes that giving weapons to Russia will significantly damage relations between the EU and China '.

He hopes that China 'plays its role and promotes a fair peace, which respects the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine'.

Which one is the social assistance corruptor? Yesterday it was reported that Mita was asking for mercy. Yes, he was asking to be released. Really asking for mercy, bro, oh, this is how small the corruption is. Bro, 10,000 out of more than millions of motorbikes, only 10,000, OK? Sorry, how many millions of big recipients were there before? We are talking about the specific purpose of corruption. Social assistance triangle. I and TretanMuslim are certainly not true saints, of course if we are in that system, where billions or even trillions of money is floating around before our eyes, maybe we will be tempted, maybe if we are Hilda, this is someone who is corrupt. yes, 2 years ago, people really said that hahaha or Yes, it's rare for people who are corrupt. 2 years ago, they were also in the pot here again, if I was also everyone, if they weren't in that position, it would be easy to ask questions.co.

Puspo, why is the government repeating it now so intensively?  The government once got jealous when people asked for help from someone other than the government, that's why it was deleted. I'm sure that's the reason for the trick against students who are Shirk to return to being stupid Shirk. Shirk always has a lot of good fortune. The reason why it was deleted is clear, it's a criticism of the government or not or not and it's an item of money, bro. Yes.

Ukrainian soldiers say new weapons aiding fight against Russian forces in Donetsk region,"Ukrainian soldiers serving in Donetsk region said on Saturday (April 8) it was becoming easier to fight off Russian attacks after they had received more weapons sent from the west.

Ukraine hopes the arrival of western tanks, armoured vehicles, trucks and munitions will give the country an advantage over the enemy and improving weather conditions will allow their troops to advance.

“We received more weapons. Spring makes me happy. I hope this is the countdown for all of it to end,” said one soldier, Oleksandr, standing in a head-high trench.

Unit commander Oleksii said the enemy were afraid to attack after encountering fierce defending by Ukrainian forces.

“When they start to, they receive a fending off, a very nice one,” he said.

Soldiers said Russian artillery shelling and attacks from the air were becoming less frequent.

“As time passes, there is a gradual ‘calming’ of both artillery and aviation. It shows that the amount of munitions they have gets lower,” said Andrii, a Ukrainian soldier.

"Russian agility for the west panic, US & NATO secret documents about the leaky Ukraine counterattack schedule","TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - A secret document containing the planning of the United States and NATO war in Ukraine leaked.

The secret document belonging to the US Department of Defense, the Pentagon detailed the supply of weapons to Ukraine to military training for a counterattack on Russia.

Quoting News-Evi, US and NATO secret documents have now been widely circulated on social networks.

In the document clearly decomposed a brief analysis of the military situation in early March and alleged plans for the readiness of the Ukrainian army that were being trained abroad.

One of the documents marked ""big secret"" provides data ""conflict status as of March 1"", which shows that the slide is several weeks old.

Although they did not explain the special battle plan, the file offers a glimpse of US intelligence assessments for the level of Russian and Ukraine forces.

Then the training schedule and delivery of equipment, weather data, and ammunition expenditure - including for platformhimars that are supplied by the US.

The document also showed information about the number of Ukraine Brigade - in total there were 12, 9 of which were supplied and trained by the United States.

Of that number, it is planned that approximately six brigades will be ready to fight on March 31, and the remaining three on April 30.

Pulan said, Ukraine counterattack is likely to occur in May.

The publication also said that the Ukrainian armed forces would need 250 more tanks and more than 350 mechanical vehicles.

After the disclosure of information, Pentagon panicked starting his own investigation.

At the same time, military analysts believe that the leak was carried out by Russia.

Meanwhile, quoted from Anandolu, Friday (7/4) Pentagon confirmed that his party was investigating the alleged screenshots of US and NATO secret documents about the war in Ukraine circulating on social media.

However, Deputy Pentagon Sabrina Singh, still has not specified whether the dokuman and its contents that have been circulated are original or fake.

This leak occurred when Kiev was reportedly preparing a massive counterattack on Russian troops.

If it is original, the document represents one of the most significant intelligence violations from the beginning of the Russian-Ukraine conflict. (Tribun-video.com/news-Evi/rt/Rt/anandolu)

He's in a band, but he's a madrassa student. When he gives a concert, the audience is separated from the front and back guys, and the announcement for the concert is not from Twitter but from the prayer room speakers, so it's for the residents of Cibinong, Cibitung and Chibi Chibi, hahaha.  It's hoped that Asr will be present, OK? Hi, but I'm telling you, if you're holding a concert in Madura, be careful. Madurese people have a strong fanaticism about high music. Yesterday Justin Bieber had a big riot, the kids were on holiday with the apostle, that's why they were guarded with barbed wire by the police, but  Why are the police guarding the wire? If it's not guarded, it's not allowed to transport it.

Eh, maybe it's because there are too many lies, the audience is different from Korean bands, Korean boy bands there, indeed, if someone is lip-smacking, the audience protests that if the demonstration in Indonesia is not in sync, the sound here is not good.  Seriously, it's better to listen to a Chinese cellphone with a loud voice, complete facilities, radio, TV, bathroom inside. Yes, that's serious, you know.

We should know that in prayer we are required to read the Limo reading or it is known as rukun qauli. namely the reading that we must read in prayer. The first reading that we must read in prayer, yes, that is Takbiratul Ihram, namely saying Allahahuakbar at the beginning of prayer, so this is the first reading that we must read. We must mention it in prayer. The second reading, yes, that is the reading.  which we are obliged to read in every asthma activity, that is the reading of Surah Al-Fatihah. Starting with bismillah, so the last verse is the third reading, which we are obliged to read in prayer, that is the final tahiyat reading, the fourth reading, yes, that is the reading of the greeting to the Prophet in  the final tahiyat of the kelimo reading and the last thing that we must read in prayer, that is giving greetings in the other sense of the word, if we only read these five things, it is prayer when we shop, we don't read tasbih when we prostrate, we don't read anything when  sitting between two prostrations, we don't read anything in prayer, only Limo perkoro, we read this, then our prayer is valid. Renault. These 5 readings must be recognized as rukun qauli. The other readings are soonex sahaja. Answering this question, if in prayer we only read only Bace. -mata Surah Fatihah final tahiyat we don't want Hai and for example, our prayer is invalid because potatso because we leave out the pillars of qauli which is said to be blasphemy is that we recite it so that it is heard by our ears, if we only read these 5 readings in our hearts, the prayer is also invalid  because of what? Because we must read this reading, we must recite it so that it can be heard by our own ears, hopefully it will provide benefits and understanding."

This is considered a big event among the Woi tribe. Almost every house will be busy preparing for the event.  Buber's goal is none other than to gather and get closer to the family. My tribe also keeps a unique tradition calledmukamu where every year they will welcome Ramadhan with special dances and songs. Apart from that, they also like to share food with fellow Muslim residents even though it's not as lively as in Indonesia. Ramadan in mainland China is still felt, especially for Muslims, whose number is estimated to reach 1.3 million of China's total population. My tribe also has a special menu for breaking the fast. One of them is beef noodles or in Mandarin it is called beef borromean but what is served by the tribe.  Kowe is different from beef, in general, its beef has gone through a Chinese Muslim-style syar'i process. Halal restaurants owned by Woi tribe residents are usually always busy with visitors.

It's 9:00 on a Seder day
The annual crowd's shuffled in
There's a zaidy sitting next to me
Making kiddush for all of his kin

He says ""sons, do you have any inquiries?""
Like why we trade bread for matzot?
And this maror we eat, dipping bitter in sweet
Or why we don't keep the door closed?

Oh, ma, ma, ma nishtana
La da di di dayenu

G-d set us free from the Pharaoh man
That's why we rejoice tonight 
And Jews, although pursued by the enemy,
With G-d's help, it turned out alright

Nation of Israel was tired and sore
Praying for redemption someday
Moshe Rabbeinu came and burst through door
He said, ""hey, let us out of this country""

Ah, but saying no to G-d brought on a plague attack (-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack)
You oughta know by now
All that hard work gave us broken backs
But then we were gone in a hurry
Well, the Pharaoh, he changed his mind
Yeah, but we never had a doubt
Matzah, 'cause bread can't rise up, it's time...

To move out
Ooh, we're movin' out
Out of Egypt

Clean the house, change pans, ""Strangers in a Strange Land""
Celebration, Jewish liberation
Reading from the Haggadah, ""Adir Hu"" and ""Chad Gadya""
Ten plagues, four sons, who knows one? I know one!

K-P, house clean, ""father bought for two zuzim""
Gefen, Lieber's and Kedem, next year in Jerusalem
""Dayenu"", charoset, we sold all of our chametz 
Tell me, what is all this for? I can't take much more maror!

G-d set a bush on fire 
Moses saw it burning, 
Still today we're learning 
G-d set a bush on fire
And when we are gone 
We'll see the flame live on, and on, and on, and on...

Four cups of red?
Four cups of white?
This night is different from all other nights
It's 'cause of what G-d did for us
When we made our Exodus",2022-04-11T16:00:11Z,UCekGB6Wu_kiDx81RerAiqdQ,Music,261.0,964360,11725,0,445,2023-11-07T11:03:53.426790,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t1k6HmUY6Zk/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,t1k6HmUY6Zk,[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do it's nine o'clock on a saturday the annual crowds shuffled in the moon there's do you have any inquiries [Music] bitter and sweet and why we don't keep the door closed [Music] set us free from the pharaoh man that's why we rejoice tonight and jews although pursued by the enemy with god's help it turned out all right [Music] [Music] all that hard work gave us broken backs but then we were gone in a hurry [Music] [Music] it's time to move out [Music] tell me what is all this for i can't take much more we are tomorrow we'll see the flames on [Music] are white tonight is different from all other nights because of what god did for us when we made our accidents [Music] [Music] you

Where the tribe is, that's where we can find the menu. Halal food and mosque buildings. The Sukuh Wei have lived in China for hundreds of years, precisely during the reign of the Tang Dynasty. It is believed that this tribe was born from intermarriage between Silk Road traders and Chinese people who lived in the local area. The appearance of the Hai tribe is also recognized by the majority of  they wear Islamic attributes in their daily lives, the men wear white caps. While the women wear the hijab, they are also famous for their friendly character and smile [Music] based on their geographic location, the Hai tribe is concentrated in the Ningxia Hainan Fensu area with dancing high. To get to know them more closely, you can visit the village  Muslim Cake is located in a city at the tip of the Indonesian province. Just like in Indonesia, Ramadan in China is also full of traditions of breaking the fast together when the fasting month arrives. The Woi tribe usually breaks the fast with their family. This is considered a big event among the Woi tribe. Almost every house will be busy preparing for the event.  Buber's goal is none other than to gather and get closer to the family. My tribe also keeps a unique tradition calledmukamu where every year they will welcome Ramadhan with special dances and songs. Apart from that, they also like to share food with fellow Muslim residents even though it's not as lively as in Indonesia. Ramadan in mainland China is still felt, especially for Muslims, whose number is estimated to reach 1.3 million of China's total population. My tribe also has a special menu for breaking the fast. One of them is beef noodles or in Mandarin it is called beef borromean but what is served by the tribe.  Kowe is different from beef, in general, its beef has gone through a Chinese Muslim-style syar'i process. Halal restaurants owned by Woi tribe residents are usually always busy with visitors. Towards sunset, the legal waiter will welcome visitors with a warm greeting, yes, viewers. That's the picture of my tribe hugging.  Islam is China, look forward to the beauty of other Chinese Muslim cultures in the next episode [Music] hi hi hi hi Hi Ho"

"The road is covered with a wall, starting with a red light and horn until finally dismantled","Nur Sayuti, a resident of the Marpoyan Termination Village, Pekanbaru, Riau, built a 2.5 meter high wall on a residential road on Sunday (11/04/2021).

"Rohingya in Aceh, a dilemma between humanity and the potential of social friction","The decision to accept Rohingya refugees in Indonesia, especially in Aceh, is a dilemma step and has two knife sides.

On the one hand, a sense of humanity is at stake to help, but on the other hand there is the potential for social friction in the community.

Recently, hundreds of Rohingya were again stranded in Aceh, and occurred in two consecutive days.

The first group ship arrived at the coast of Ladong Village, Sunday (12/25/2022), allegedly damaged and then carried by the wind, carrying 57 people.

They were reportedly all male, in a weak condition and starving after spending a month at sea, according to local officials.

The next day or Monday (12/26/2022), a ship containing 174 people reached the coast of Ujung Pie Village, Muara Tiga District, Pidie Regency.

The Indonesian government discussed the placement of refugees in special locations following the sound of rejection from a number of Acehnese people.

Sociologist from Syiah Kuala University, Masrizal said, the arrival of Rohingya refugees could have social and economic impacts.

From the economic side, for example, Aceh still ranks first in the terminal province in Sumatra.

That is, the Aceh Provincial Government has a limited budget, with the main focus is the welfare of local residents, not vice versa.

""There will be a locally impact among the community, namely social jealousy. Why is the Rohing is more important than us? Aceh as the poorest area in Sumatra, even helps others. From the sociological side, this social jealousy conflict has the potential to exist,"" said Masrizal, likeQuoted from BBC News Indonesia.

For this reason, said Masrizal, the need for an important role from the central government, including from international institutions, so that the potential for social friction can be prevented and avoided.

On the other hand, the United Nations has called for countries in the region to coordinate to protect Rohingya residents who have dangerous travel in the sea.

It is a symbol of Madurese people's dissatisfaction with the situation around them. B Don't laugh, this is serious, but Madurese people are taking part in contests.  Photos are easy, for example, the magic show is the mystery. It has a name, Mr. Slow. If he appears chained and the curtains are open, he can escape. If I am chained there, the curtains are opened. The chain is gone. I conjure it so that I can make money. I can raise funds.  Mister Slow, Madurese people don't like to see him because when he performs he likes to spy on iron. It's a very powerful performance. It's as if iron were crying if you don't think about the feeling of iron. This is what he said, he's a fakir magician. That's not how it's fakir.

Thank you, Bear Masha Allah, the absolute prayer of the qunut prayer in the morning prayer is a highly expected sunnah.  we are not slow, Imam Syafi'i Robbi Allah ta'ala Anhu other schools of thought say no, it's like Imam Abu Hanifah, if there is someone who doesn't Qunut, then he says he wants to join Tamim Abu Hanifah, yes, people are really good, there's nothing wrong, but if there are people who don't Qunut blame  According to Imam Syafi'i, he is wrong. Imam Syafi'i also uses proof, so if someone doesn't follow Imam Abu Hanifah's taqlid, Abu Hanifah's ROM is right, but if he follows Qunut's diet, he always insults Qunut, that's wrong, because Imam Syafi'  i with the proof, well, the Qunut prayer is the qunut prayer clearly Omah early in the manha de that affinity reaches to the end only For anyone who can't memorize the Qunut So don't let it happen because you follow the Imam Syafi'i madhhab Don't miss out on the ancient virtues tip then you can  read any prayer Hi, maybe because you are afraid of being discovered that you don't memorize it, don't read it out loud, just read Rabbana Atina Fiddunya Hasanah. So you still stand for the qunut and We offer it and we need to hold on with mad hap so that we are not easily swayed even after that we see that play is right, we don't need to blame, but adhering to the madhhab is important so that Istiqomah Hi, don't pretend to know, this is expensive, Indonesia can do it, Sire, you are fresh, Gisel and selfies. Qunut is a sunnah, it is not obligatory to complete the sunnah, but it is strongly encouraged, so in whatever circumstances you are still Qunut  If you don't know it by heart, read another prayer. Whatever the name Qunut means, it also contains a prayer, including Rabbana Atina Fiddu, even if you become a priest, because you are considered to have memorized it, you know Robbana Atina by heart. Yes, that's fine and the congregation doesn't need to protest, you know.  that the priest didn't memorize it but got a reward Hi so don't let anyone leave Qunut Hi well then if we stand behind someone who doesn't Qunut you are sure he doesn't Qunut because maybe you think India met or went to Turkey there They asked Ms Hanifah they don't use  Qunut, so when you don't read the shortest Qunut, you read the short Qunut so that you don't miss it, but you are personally in the corner and this is not considered mukhalafah wrong. Why don't you start a new job, even if you don't sleep after you smoke the morning prayer near the two samiallahulimanhamidah  Imam read Robbana. You also read it a little faster then you pray qunut for a moment wherever you are, maybe it will be easy for you to perform Umrah Amen or Hajj Amen then there you are not for you, you will still be old-fashioned behind it, but if you can pursue this sunnah, you can still do it and you are no different. violates the Imam Qunut Yes, but if there is an Imam who doesn't have tasyahud sanitation, the following second Why are you going to be a convert, that looks like you will violate the Imam, you stand up, we sit, tasyahud and the sunnahs are the same as the sunnahs, yo, you can. So if we unep read behind the Imam, even if the Imam doesn't read, we read faster, those who memorize it, read Rabbana Atina Fiddunya Hasanah Wafil, it won't be too long, even before the Imam has finished, even the Samiallahulimanhamidah logo, we read quickly, Robbanaa Lakalhamdu, then read the qunut prayer so concisely, so because of this, we stick to it.  on Saturday it's important Why don't we easily be swayed by fanatical schools of thought without making other people important because fanatics as people have to stick to it if it's not easy to get confused then why is it like this like this you Imams are great people Imam Abu Hanifah at the time Hi, the Hanafi school of thought says that there is no kitchen with strong evidence but you cannot insult each other, even Abu Hanifah and Batak Syafi'i are also very familiar. among the ulama there are usually good discussions like that. If you are in Indonesia from the Imam Syafi'i school, then you read Qunut, even if you don't memorize kunut, you can read other prayers. Any prayer, especially the Rabbana Atina Fiddunya Hasanah prayer until it's finished, that's all wallahualam bishowab [  Music]"

At that time, the pigs were carrying out inspections after the morning roll call, the first post- Eid holiday on Monday, May 9 2012. Mun Pig was surprised that the Kampung Baru Village Office wasn't there yet.  The employees who came, including the village head, even though there was a resident named Teguh, had been waiting since morning at 07.30 West Indonesia Time, but until 10.30 West Indonesia Time, the employee on duty had not come. Teguh then conveyed the problem he was facing to Bobby, he wanted to take care of his special BPJS completeness file which was currently in progress.  According to his confession, he was sick, he was given three days to take care of the completeness of the PBJS, if the service was past due, his sick child would be transferred to public services, so he asked for help from the mayor of Medan. Hearing Teguh Bobby's complaint, he then instructed the head of the general section as well as the acting head of BKD and  PSDM city B and sutong bone Lubis to take action, he then contacted the Head of the City B Social Service and if Teguh was registered as a family who received PKH then his BPJS would automatically be active.

BPJS not long after that, the Head of Kampung Baru Village, Indra Siregar and the Head of Medan Maimun Subdistrict, Nasution, arrived at the office with the shipping staff.

Afghan refugees in Indonesia are also worried after the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban, so far none of them can contact their families and relatives. Following is the coverage by Muhammad Reza and cameraman Alanindra who shared  refugee stories about the company and atrocities of the Taliban in Afghanistan Hi, the Taliban militant group finally succeeded in taking over the Afghan Presidential Palace, this news was granted on the week of August 15, this news was immediately heard by Afghan refugees who are currently in refugee camps in the East Ciputat area, South Tangerang, one of the refugees Husein admitted that he had not been able to contact his parents who were in Kabul for more than two weeks. He was worried about his parents' condition when the Taliban came to Kabul. I can't do anything here, I can't work If possible, if I can work, I'll give them money, they can leave, you too, Den Deni Karang, other people, but they're still preventing it, it's been two, two weeks now, I haven't been in the connection box, they don't know what condition they are in  Are they healthy or are they still alive or dead? I don't know yet. I've already sold the dominggo. We're going after the Taliban group. It's also felt that his younger brother is renting a cell with his older brother. Husein Sel-A chose to leave Afghanistan for security. He always says that the Taliban took his brother's life while serving as a soldier. Until now, he hates him. Against the Taliban, it still remains. Apart from that, this 17 year old woman also confirmed that women experienced restrictions under the rule of the Taliban. Women are not allowed to work. I don't know if women are not allowed to work. Even now, maybe in recent years there are also some who are working, whereas now they are not allowed. Women are not allowed.  I don't even have the courage to work or even leave the house, for example in 2A they say that at school you can just cover your private parts and now covering your private parts can actually mean you have to cover them which is visible. Only those mocking eyes will be there for a while if in the future I don't know if it will change or not. because what Afghan refugees can do in this place is that they only monitor the condition of their country through social media and news from around 200 refugees, mostly from Afghanistan, living in this place. The condition of Afghanistan, which is currently controlled by the Taliban, has added to their worries even more than a week ago.  cannot at all contact their families and relatives who are in Afghanistan, they can only hope and pray that conditions in Afghanistan can return to being conducive from South Tangerang Muhammad Reza sensory tools"

Even now we can break the fast together. Oh God, I feel like it's all mixed up, because when we're inside like that, there are definitely times when we want to be free.  There must be sadness because we weren't in prison for 2 years, we were in prison for years, well, Mas Nanas and I are almost the same, right? The sentence is 9 years and 3 months. I'm 9 years and 9 months and both of them don't get it.  It can be completely like that, except before being released, right? So we have something in common, eee, if I say, over time, fate is like that. So I also feel that Mas Anas must, O Allah, miss him inside, but we have to be free and also to welcome those in front of the prison and welcome him.  the future is like that, right? But I'm sure that the problem will definitely be. God willing, Eee is an extraordinary figure and not only that, when his speech was released, it made me cry too, wasn't it because I honestly haven't seen a speech like that in years, even though it's true for  That's me and the problem is more with my bestie, you can see how there are so many people not only from the same party before but also from different parties, there are different organizations, there are new mass organizations, I know there are these mass organizations, but they come  It's not a short time to welcome, you know, 9 years 3 months, almost 10 years, but they have been faithfully waiting for the problem to come out. Yes, it's definitely because of the humble figure of Mas Anas, first of all, and the figure of Mas Anas, who perhaps in the past was very helpful, Mas the pineapple, right? If you help, that's right.  I don't choose people like that, so everyone is helped and everyone is looking for a solution and everything is like he said, it has become like a base, without looking at people who have wronged him and even people who have bullied him or tyrannized him, right?  Anas, yes, nature is working, how come Mbak Enji remains united? What I learned from Anas's time is to forgive, continue to seek justice, continue to search for the truth, but this is not to save the drums of war. There are more people who suspect that Mas Anas is leaving and maybe it could be a threat or many people are actually buying it. I will take revenge on anyone who commits criminalization according to Mas Anas's version. There is concern that from the perspective of an Angelina soundtrack. Could it be done if I rarely touch things, bro? Is that what you want to do? Isn't that because I I also want to assess that Mas Anas is more neutral in the sense that he is someone who has experienced an unpleasant journey, he was once at the top and then suddenly fell and that fall was accompanied by constant insults and insults, definitely after this.  The problem is that if you eat, you will definitely be bullied and you will also be insulted, that's normal, there are those who like it and those who don't like it. But according to Angelina's figure, Anas Urbaningrum would be better off returning to politics or what if I don't have the courage to advise you to do it? [Applause] What's more, from my side, I can only pray that the Mas Anas River will be truly guarded by Allah, so I can't say anything too grandiose, OK? Because I know Mas Anas' heart, like that, sometimes someone's purity is inside.  Even a place that is a little dark can look dark, but the engine continues to fight for the truth, continue to seek justice, right and never get angry with people who we feel have wronged us?"

THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION INTO  THE LEAK AS THE EXTENT IS  INVESTIGATED.  THERE WAS SENSITIVE AND HIGHLY  CLASSIFIED MATERIAL INCLUDING  DETAILS ON THE WAR IN UKRAINE.  THE U.S. HAS BEEN SPYING ON  INTERNATIONAL ALLIES.  OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO  DETERMINE THE AUTHENTICITY OF  THE MATERIAL.  OUR SENIOR INVESTIGATOR JOINS  US NOW.  TELL US, HOW LEGITIMATE IS THE  MATERIAL IN THESE DOCUMENTS.  >> IT IS A MIXED BAG.  SOME OF THE RECORDS APPEAR  AUTHENTIC AND OTHERS APPEAR TO  BE DOCTORED.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM IT HAS A  SENSE OF TRYING TO CONVEY AN  INTENT OR MOTIVATION AND WE  SPOKE TO HR McMASTER YESTERDAY.  HE SAID IT LOOKS LIKE THIS  INFORMATION WARFARE.  THEY HAVE TAKEN REAL  INFORMATION AND MIX IT WITH  DOCTORED INFORMATION TO CONVEY  A MESSAGE WHICH MAY BE MORE  FAVORABLE TO RUSSIA THAN  UKRAINE.  >> THAT MAKES ME WONDER, ARE  THESE DOCUMENTS SOMETHING THAT  WERE LEAKED OR SOMETHING  HACKED?  WHAT WOULD BE THE SEVERITY OF  EITHER OPTION AND HOW CLOSE ARE  WE TO FIGURING THAT OUT?  >>  >> Reporter: IT DOES APPEAR THAT THEY WERE STOLEN DOCUMENTS NOT  HACKED OR BREACHED.  OOKING AT THE DOCUMENTS, YOU  CAN SEE THAT THERE IS THE LION  SHARE OF MILITARY RECORDS, CIA  RECORDS AND SOME FROM THE  DEFENSE AGENCY. WHAT CAUGHT MY  ATTENTION WAS THE  CLASSIFICATION MARKINGS.  THERE ARESOME SECRET, SCI AND  INFORMATION WHERE THE SOURCE IS  EXTREMELY FRAGILE AND SOMETHING  CALLED TK.

THAT WOULD INVOLVE SIGNALS  INTELLIGENCE, GETTING ON  PEOPLE'S PHONES OR HUMAN  INTELLIGENCE.  THOSE ARE HARD TO REPLICATE.  MOST OF THE SLIDES IN MY VIEW  OUR AERIAL IMAGERY.  SO MUCH OF THAT IS COMMERCIALLY  AVAILABLE SO NOT SURE WERE  GIVING AWAY A LOT OF SECRETS  THERE.  >> THE SEVERITY OF THIS LEAK  AND HOW DELICATE THE  INFORMATION THAT IS OUT THERE  MAKES ME THINK ABOUT THE OTHER  CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE  BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE HOMES  OF FORMER PRESIDENTS AND MIKE  PENCE AS WELL.

CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT WHY  THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND ARE WE  STILL WONDERING IF TOO MANY  PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO HIGHLY  CLASSIFIED INFORMATION?  >> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.  WHEN I HEAR FROM CONTACTS,  PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED IN  INTELLIGENCE IS THAT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT HAS AN OVER  CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM.  FAR TOO MUCH INFORMATION IS  OVER CLASSIFIED OR CLASSIFIED  AT A HIGH LEVEL.  WITH THAT SAID, IT SIGNIFICANT  THAT SOME OF THE RECORDS THAT  WERE RECOVERED AT THE FORMER  PRESIDENT AND CURRENT  PRESIDENT'S HOMES AND THE VICE  PRESIDENT ARE BEING SHARED WITH  CONGRESS.

Bang, it's 29 bites and it's working. It really gets attention from netizens, some of whom agree with this netizen's view and Adi also agrees with him and other people to buy Rayeu clothes.  If you ask my opinion, I'm not the son of Konda who started the star and the condition of the appearance. Previously, I shared the glory of the Moon and Stars. Adi also conveyed the link for the program to buy clothes from star balls. I hope that's why we like to see the glory of children.  Our country is young, so our left is to focus on the brand, and we also know that it has marketing for this year. It's really crazy, imagine making it, using it, making it for a launch, close to spending up to 2 million Ringgit for production [Music], so maybe we can just ask about quality control, right?  maybe the netizens who are complaining are those who are not so lucky because they got a product that escaped QC, let's just get to know more closely, we have this, sometimes it's not in the 100 charts that we put out, 100. Oh, everything is perfect, perfect, ah, it has to be in one or two  which is faulty so maybe that's what netizens can get, but there are also netizens who comment on the market increasing prices for star football shirts. Previously, we could get them for under 100 but now the price has reached 200 Ringgit and the problem is that the quality of the clothes is still higher. kwangsamu whatever it is or whatever we are waiting for is a response from the Dutch star if there is a second part, the response is for myself. I am not the type who sews Raya kusdi clothes, even if it is 100 kitchens per year, if it is even less it is possible that it will be one and a half and for myself I will not  following the netizen's claws, that's why I won't buy Elrah's clothes because I won't support him even though I once advised X's wife on social media to say that I'm getting blocked but I still feel sorry for darling, I lost. You bought Google in the market. The important thing is that I didn't touch it, so for how many times I don't know, I still like it less if you say buy Rayeu clothes. I hope that if people can join together to buy Raya clothes, you can DM Justice clothes.  I bought this as a birthday gift for 4 or 5 years, I still use it and it still looks premium, looks exclusive and the Hago is not expensive, and one more thing, of course, if you get a frozen spot, take out your brand of clothes. 5 whatever time you have to go home, they are the only ones who are important.  don't share too much rayeuk preparation and again, if you type that, the use of our sustenance is more for value, for example, we salute the orphans for pushing them back and forth to me, that's again Afdal and Aikatsu rhymes, waking up in the morning still foggy because I'm getting ready to go to the jungle to buy clothes  up to hundreds but just use it once, if you like the content on that channel, subscribe OK Assalamualaikum [Music] [Applause]"

LYRICS:

If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say so 
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day

So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing 
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you

There ain't no mistaking
It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

POLICE IN THE EXCAVATION OF A BACKYARD PATIO IS PROVIDING THEM GUIDANCE. THAT'S WHERE THEY USE GUIDANCE IN THE SEARCH FOR A MISSING SIX YEAR OLD TARRANT COUNTY BOY. HELLO I'M STEVE EAGER. HELLO EVERYBODY. I'M HEATHER HAYES, SO POLICE WORKED LATE INTO THE NIGHT, REMOVING CONCRETE FROM THE BACKYARD OF THE HOME WHERE SIX YEAR OLD NOEL RODRIGUEZ ALVAREZ LIVED. EVERMAN POLICE BELIEVE THE CHILD IS DEAD. HIS MOTHER AND HER HUSBAND ARE FUGITIVES WHO FLED OVERSEAS. BUT BECAUSE NOEL HAS NOT BEEN SEEN IN SEVERAL MONTHS, POLICE ARE NOT SURE WHEN OR HOW HE DIED. LAST NIGHT SEARCH DID NOT TURN UP PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, BUT POLICE BELIEVE THEY ARE INDEED MAKING PROGRESS EXPORT. JOHN ENGLAND IS IN EVERMAN NOW WITH AN UPDATE, DION. THERE. WILL POLICE BELIEVE HUMAN REMAINS WERE ONCE IN THE AREA WHERE DIGGING TOOK PLACE ON MONDAY, AND WHILE THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING SPECIFIC, LEADING THEM TO NOEL RODRIGUEZ ALVAREZ, THE POLICE CHIEF TODAY EXPLAINED WHAT TRIGGERED THAT DIGGING. NEW INFORMATION FROM EVERMAN POLICE TUESDAY REGARDING MONDAY'S EXTENSIVE DIGGING BENEATH RECENTLY POURED CONCRETE PATIO BEHIND THE HOME WHERE NOEL RODRIGUEZ ALVAREZ LIVED. IT BEGAN WITH A LARGE PIECE OF INDOOR OUTDOOR CARPET FOUND IN A DUMPSTER NEAR THE HOME. POLICE SAY THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY'S STEPFATHER ARE STEEP, THINK DISPOSED OF IT THE NIGHT BEFORE HE THE BOY'S MOTHER, CINDY RODRIGUEZ SING, AND SIX OTHER CHILDREN FLEW FROM DFW TO NEW DELHI, INDIA. POLICE SAY THE SAME PIECE OF CARPET WAS ONCE ON THE FLOOR OF AN OLDER SHED THAT STOOD ON THE PROPERTY UNTIL A MONTH AGO. BOTH THE CARPET AND THE CONCRETE WHERE THE SHED ONCE STOOD CAUSED CADAVER DOGS TO REACT. INTERESTING PIECES. WHEREAS IS THAT THE CARPET WASN'T EVEN AT THE HOUSE. IT WASN'T EVEN AT THE LOCATION FOR THE CANINES TO BE ABLE TO ALERT TO A PIECE OF EVIDENCE AT ONE PLACE AND THEN GO OVER AND ALERT AGAIN WHERE IT WAS PREVIOUSLY. I MEAN, ALL THAT TENDS TO ADD UP, SO IT DOES. IT DOES LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE HUMAN REMAINS AT ONE POINT IN TIME IN THE SHED THAT USED TO EXIST. WE'RE NOW THAT CONCRETE PATIO SINCE THE CONCRETE DIG DID NOT YIELD ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, AND CHARLES PARSONS YARD. MEANTIME PARSONS SHARED HIS THOUGHTS WITH FOX FOUR ABOUT THE ONGOING SEARCH FOR NOEL. POLICE ARE THEY'RE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACES. ALL I CAN SAY BECAUSE HE WAS HERE. HE'S NOT HERE. POLICE ARE STRATEGIZING WHERE THE NEXT SEARCH AREAS WILL BE. WE REACHED OUT TO THE FBI ON TUESDAY. REGARDING EFFORTS TO FIND CINDY RODRIGUEZ SING AND HER HUSBAND ARE SO DEEP IN INDIA. A CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE INVESTIGATION, BUT IT CANNOT REVEAL SPECIFICS. ALL OF IT, UNDERSCORING LINGERING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. THREE WEEKS, FOUR WEEKS OF THIS SINCE THIS CASE STARTED RIGHT AND SO SHE'S BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY. SURELY SHE KNOWS THIS IS GOING ON SHIRLEY. SHE KNOWS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR NOEL AND HAD HAD THERE NOT BEEN ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS, OR HAD THERE BEEN A REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE REACHED OUT AND TOLD US THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT CONTACT. NOW THE PHYSICAL SEARCH , THOUGH PAUSED FOR NOW WILL RESUME LIKELY TOMORROW OR THURSDAY THAT, ACCORDING TO THE CHIEF, IT'S A VERY LATEST LIFE."

"Vladimir Putin overthrew the offer of Joe Biden's conversation, swearing at an attack on Ukraine","TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - United States President Joe Biden is now declaring ready to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin related to the invasion of Ukraine.

However, the request was immediately rejected by Putin.

In fact, he vowed to continue his attack on Kiev.

Putin revealed the reason for refusing Joe Biden's offer to hold the conversation.

According to him, the US insisted that he would not recognize the land of Ukraine which was invaded by Moscow as Russia's property.

It is known, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in the White House, Joe Biden expressed his desire to talk to Putin.

This conversation can be done if Putin is willing to end the war.

But until now Biden said there were no signs of Russia to end the war.

""I am ready to talk to Mr. Putin if he tried immediately to end the war. But until now, he has not done it,"" he added.

It is known, Biden has not spoken directly with Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Hit the US, Kremlin said the possibility of conversation could occur, but Russia would not withdraw from Ukraine.

In fact, further attacks will be carried out in the territory of the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.

In recent weeks, Moscow has targeted his attack on energy infrastructure in Ukraine.

As a result, millions of Kiev residents live without electricity even though they have entered winter.

Unexpectedly, Mrs. Iriana asked the Paspampres and the bodyguards to join them for dinner along with a request conveyed by Mrs. Iriana to the Paspampres commander who was on duty at that time. This clearly shocked the guards because usually the guards eat near the vehicle so they can move quickly at any time. From the pyro video per presidential secretariat, you can see the Paspampres and the guards eating spread across several long tables but it is not explained what menu the presidential guards are eating.

It's Scott Manley here and now in honor of asteroid day I've done something rather special. So, this is a 360º video If you don't know how to watch them, 
you should look at my other guide video. But the idea here is that you are standing and looking around and In the night sky above you, you can see all the stars. Well, and below you I can get rid of the horizon and you can imagine you are now floating in space at the location of the Earth. you might be able to pick out some planets there and the Sun, which is the yellow fuzzy object. I'm sure you know what the Sun is, right? So, you can see the five planets that are visible from the earth Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. And you might be able to pick out some constellations But because this is Asteroid Day, I want you to be able to see the Asteroids. So, I'm just turning on the Asteroids and making the asteroids near the earth visible as if they were stars. Normally, asteroids are not visible to the naked eye because they are so small and faint. Now this is the 5,000 or so Asteroids nearest the earth. At this point, you might not be able to tell the difference between them and the stars behind them. But what I can do again, is I can alter time. I'm going to make time run faster and faster so you can start to see the motion of these Asteroids as the earth moves around and these move relative to the Earth.. The time here is running around 2 and half days every second. You can see them following their paths, flying near to the Earth and going away. Obviously, they're motion is a combination of the Earth's motion and the Asteroid's motion. And those which are moving fastest across the sky, are the ones which are passing closest to the Earth. Now, I should stress that these are only the known asteroids. By some estimates, we may have found about 1% of the near Earth Asteroids. And one of the reasons for this... Well, you can see one of the reasons.  if you look towards where the Sun is, you can see there are a few Asteroids floating around there. Well, normally, you can't point a telescope at the Sun. So, if you imagine that there were undiscovered Asteroids floating through that space as they came close to us, we would never discover them. If you actually look away from the Sun, you'll see there are a lot more asteroids hanging out about out there And that's in part because of this inability to discover objects that spend most of their time interior to the earth's orbit. Now, there is a space telescope concept called ""Sentinel"",  which is being championed by the B-6-12 Foundation. This would put a telescope between the Earth and the Sun. And it would be able to discover many, many objects that we could not see from the Earth And the reason, of course, that you want to discover these objects Is that potentially, some of these could hit the Earth And we'd like to know if this was going to be the case. Right now we're essentially flying around the Sun through this population of Asteroids with your eyes closed And that's why I'm advocating for more resources to be put into this task of discovering and cataloging  this population of potentially hazardous asteroids. So that we can know if something really does have our name on us Or, so that we can sleep soundly in our beds at night knowing that nothing's coming our way. I hoping you'll join me in many many more distinguished signatories in supporting this cause. I'm Scott Manley Fly safe."

In fact, Trump has been known to be quite controversial.

Donald Trump is known to have become a heavy rival of Biden in the 2020 US presidential election.

He even continued to criticize to insult his opponent.

Later, during the invasion of Trump it was also found to often praise Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticized Russia's involvement in the 2016 US presidential election.

Trump even had time to praise Putin as a smart leader, the day before carrying out an attack on Ukraine, on February 24

Meanwhile, Biden himself has been banned from entering Russia since mid -March, as well as US Foreign Minister Antony Blinken, Defense Minister Lloyd Austin, and joint Chief of Staff General Mark Milley.

What China’s New Peacemaker Diplomacy Means for the U.S. | WSJ,"Chinese President Xi Jinping met Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and is expected to speak with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky soon. Recent diplomatic breakthroughs brokered by China in the Middle East and in Africa offer tangible evidence that Beijing is willing to use its influence to help resolve foreign disputes.

WSJ’s Austin Ramzy explains how China’s peacemaking efforts could challenge the U.S.

0:00 Xi Jinping’s goal to make China a superpower
0:53 China’s diplomatic relations between Iran, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia
1:54 China vs. U.S. diplomatic strategies
2:25 U.S.’s view on China’s diplomatic plans amid the Russia-Ukraine War

during a state visit to Moscow. (Vladimir speaking foreign language) And is soon expected to talk to Ukrainian president Volodymir Zelensky for the first time since the war started. (camera clicking) While the west has expressed concerns over China's deepening ties with Russia, Beijing has indicated an
ambition to help bring about talks toward a ceasefire in Ukraine. - Xi jinping, one of his
main goals is to make China get into a a superpower. And so part of that is being involved in security discussions and
peace talks around the world. - [Host] Recent diplomatic
breakthrough is brokered by China offered tangible evidence
that Beijing is willing to use its influence to help
resolve foreign disputes. Austin Ramsey covers China's global reach for the Journal and explains
what Beijing's model of a new diplomacy means for the US. (upbeat music) On March 10th, Iran and
Saudi Arabia announced that they agreed to reestablish
diplomatic relations after seven years of estrangement in a deal mediated by China. (Wang speaking foreign language) - This is a sort of thing
that would be difficult for the US to bring about. The US doesn't have formal ties with Iran and is of course very critical
of the Iranian authorities. There was obviously a concern
that the US had lost clout particularly in the Middle East, and China was now playing
this much more important role. - [Host] And this wasn't
the first showcase of Xi's diplomatic ambitions. Last June, China offered to quote, silence the guns across the
troubled horn of Africa, at its first regional Peace conference. Delegates from six countries gathered in Ethiopia to hear China's pledge that Beijing was best
placed to restore stability to the region. - The Chinese approach to these negotiations
can be very different from the United States. China has a policy of non-interference, which often means not being critical of governments and just focusing
on bringing them together. That can be very appealing,
especially to governments that don't want their records examined. - [Host] While China
has sought to contrast its regional policy with the US, Washington has accused Beijing of using the mediation
dialogues to bolster authoritarian regimes and
expand its security footprint. (bomb exploding) An analyst say securing
any diplomatic wins in Ukraine would be a much
tougher challenge for Beijing. European Capitals and
Washington have so far greeted Beijing's diplomatic
push with skepticism. - China can't have it
both ways when it comes to the Russian aggression Ukraine, it can't be putting
forward peace proposals on the one hand while
actually feeding the flames of the fire that Russia has
started, with the other hand. - Both Xi Jinping and Vladimir
Putin share a deep distrust of the US and the West, and
they see the world order as led by the West to the detriment
of their own countries and so it's very harmful for China, if Russia is damaged by
the war and it no longer can play a role in supporting
this effort to sort of lessen American and Western
influence over the world. - [Host] As part of its
push for what Xi calls big power diplomacy,
Beijing increased its budget for diplomatic travel and other related
expenses by 12% this year. (soft music) In a bid to counter China's inroads. - It's very, very good feedback in Africa. - [Host] Secretary of State,
Anthony Blinken traveled to Ethiopia and Negele in
mid-March and he's just one of the many US officials
who are visiting regions where Washington and Beijing
are competing for influence. - I think nothing focuses
the US like a competitor. This could sort of bring about sort of renewed
American efforts to engage in diplomacy around the
world, engage in diplomacy in some places that the
US might have ignored, a little bit in in recent years. (soft music)"

This video is chapter 4 in my series on special relativity, and it covers how things that appear simultaneous from one perspective in our universe aren't simultaneous from other moving perspectives - that is, from inertial reference frames moving at different speeds. This is explained via the Lorentz transformation of coordinates of the events in question, enacted with a mechanical minkowski diagram, aka mechanical Lorentz transformation, aka spacetime globe.

Created by Henry Reich",2018-04-26T13:35:05Z,UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg,Science & Technology,228.0,784155,22000,0,896,2023-11-07T11:04:42.616014,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrNVsfkGW-0/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,SrNVsfkGW-0,"In our universe, when you change from a non-moving
perspective to a moving one, or vice versa, that change of perspective is represented
by a what's called Lorentz transformation, which is a kind of squeeze-stretch rotation
of spacetime that I've mechanically implemented with this spacetime globe. A quick reminder - spacetime diagrams plot
position on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis, and something moving as
time passes traces out a path through spacetime called a worldline. One of the first things you might notice about
Lorentz transformations is that events that were at different places at the same time
before the transformation aren't at the same time after the transformation. This means that from the perspectives of people
going different speeds, simultaneous events for one person won't be simultaneous for the
other, and vice versa. For example, if from my perspective these
two boxes spontaneously combust at the same time, and you're moving at a third the speed
of light to my right, then from your perspective, that is, the perpective from which you're
not moving so your worldline is purely vertical, from your perspective the box on the right
will combust first, and the box on the left will combust second. The takeaway here is that our universe has
neither an absolute notion of time nor an absolute sense of simultaneous events, and
that simultaneity breaks down more the farther away from each other two things are – a
box even farther to the left that from my perspective simultaneously spontaneously combusts
with the others will, from your moving perspective, be even farther out of sync with the box on
the right. This is described by the time part of the
Lorentz Transformation equations, the part that says t new = gamma times t minus v times
x over c squared). Because of the x in there, the farther away
an event is from you, the more its time from the new perspective will be out of sync with
events closer to you. Though because of the factor of c squared
in the denominator, which is huge, it's hard to notice anything being out of sync until
either your speed or distance to the object in question are really really really big – like,
you'd have to be going half the speed of light and be comparing things farther apart than
the earth and moon before things would become more than 1 second out of sync. But in that case, events that were simultaneous
from my perspective really would be out of sync for you! As surprising as this may seem, it might feel
more familiar and comfortable when you remember that this “getting out of alignment” phenomenon
happens to points at the same place in space, too, which is literally what we think of as
defining motion – from my perspective, this box is at the same position at different times
– that is, it's not moving; maybe, “simulspacious”– but from your moving perspective it's at different
positions at different times – it is moving. Relativity of simultaneity is just the other
side of the coin – the fact that events that happen at the same time at different
spatial positions happen at different times when viewed from a moving perspective. All together, in our universe, the takeaway
is this: events that were previously either all at the same place or all at the same time
get out of alignment with each other when you change to a moving perspective. A big thanks again to Mark Rober for making
the spacetime globe a reality, and to dive more into the details of relativity of simultaneity,
I highly recommend heading over to Brilliant.org's course on special relativity that they've
been developing simultaneously with this video series (well, at least, simultaneous from
my perspective). There, you can explore custom scenarios and
do actual puzzles and problems that help you build on what you learned in this video, like
figuring out how laser tag would work at relativistic speeds! The special relativity questions on Brilliant.org
are specifically designed to help you go deeper on the topics I'm including in this series,
and you can get 20% off of a Brilliant subscription by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that’s Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access to all of Brilliant's courses and puzzles, and lets
Brilliant know you came from here."

'Secret Camp' Muslim Uighur China: 'They want to erase Uighur Culture' - BBC News Indonesia,"A secret document reveals the actual condition in secret camps built by the Chinese government for Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang Province.

The Chinese government insisted that the camps were the center of education and training, but the documents read by the Panorama BBC show the opposite.

In the document a firm order is written for the camp manager, such as: 'No one should run away', 'Enforce discipline and punishment', until 'Additional Mandarin lessons are mandatory'.

Gulzira, a survivor who had been in the camp for 15 months, said he told his experience of living in the camp.

""There are cameras everywhere, even in the toilet. We are not free. We can't run away,"" he said.

A lawyer who was asked for an opinion by the BBC said that the discipline that was upheld in the camp was even 'more military than military prisons'.

""It is very difficult to say that phenomenon aside from being a large scale brainwashing scheme, which is designed and aimed at minority groups. The scheme is designed to erase the culture of the Uighur as an ethnic group of earth,"" said Ben Emmerson, a lawyer for human rights and humanitarian lawBritish origin.

Meanwhile, the Chinese Ambassador to the British called the secret document as a 'fake news' and said there were no terror attacks in Xinjiang for the past three years and residents there lived safely and happily.

China Shocked : Wake Island Has Become a New US Naval Base to Bring US Fleet to Near South China Sea,"China Shocked : Wake Island Has Become a New US Naval Base to Bring US Fleet to Near South China Sea

In the event of a Pacific war, American bombers would have to carry out a high number of sorties against enemy missile and air defense outposts in the Western Pacific. In that conflict, Wake Island would be the last American outpost in the Pacific able to get bombers into the air and keep fighters alongside them fueled up and ready to go.

Wake Island is not particularly impressive. Made of coral, the atoll is a mere twelve feet or so above sea level at its lowest point. It is remote, too. It is twenty-three hundred miles or about thirty-seven hundred kilometers west of Honolulu, and about two thousand miles, or thirty-two hundred kilometers, southeast of Tokyo. Wake Island’s remote location is what makes the speck of rock so important to the United State’s presence in the Pacific Ocean region.

Heard, is Vital to US Naval Power! In the event of a Pacific war, American bombers
would have to carry out a high number of sorties against enemy missile and air defense outposts
in the Western Pacific. In that conflict, a small island in the Pacific
called ""Wake Island"" would be the last American outpost in the Pacific able to get bombers
into the air and keep fighters alongside them fueled up and ready to go. Wake Island is not particularly impressive. Made of coral, the atoll is a mere twelve
feet or so above sea level at its lowest point. It is 2300 miles west of Honolulu, and about
2000 miles southeast of Tokyo. Wake Island’s remote location is what makes
the speck of rock so important to the United State’s presence in the Pacific Ocean region. Wake Island was claimed by the United States
in 1899, though European contact with the island had been made multiple times before
then. The island remained mostly uninhabited, minus
the occasional castaway or stranded ship’s crew until the late 1930s, when the United
States placed a small Marine garrison on the coral outpost. During World War II, Wake Island was the scene
of intense fighting between Marine elements defending the island against the Japanese,
simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Today, Wake Island remains one of the most
remote islands in the world, protected by miles and miles of open ocean. The rocky outpost has been modified extensively
since World War II and hosts a nearly ten-thousand-foot-long runway, which can accommodate all aircraft
currently in United States service. In the event of a war in the Pacific, American
bases on remote outposts like Guam or Okinawa would likely have a very difficult time fending
off hostile missile attacks, partly because of their proximity to Asia. Okinawa in particular is only around five
hundred miles or so from the Chinese coast. Even though both islands have missile defense
systems—the Patriot surface-to-air missile system and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
or Thaad, system both could be overwhelmed by a large enough missile salvo. Losses at islands nearer to Asia at the outset
of a conflict could be immense and next to impossible to prevent. Wake Island however is harder to hit, and
it might just be out of reach. Another factor besides sheer distance that
would keep Wake Island better protected is the United States’ Ground-Based Midcourse
Defense or GBMD, a missile intercept system. Whereas missile defense systems like Thaad
or the Patriot missile defense system are shorter range and provide regional protection,
the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense missile system has a much, much larger flight envelope. The GBMD system is deployed in both Alaska
and California and is specifically designed to counter longer-range missile threats against
the entire United States and Canada. Wake Island is likely just inside the interceptor’s
defense umbrella. In the event of a Pacific war, American bombers
would have to carry out a high number of sorties against enemy missile and air defense outposts
in the Western Pacific. In that conflict, Wake Island would be the
last American outpost in the Pacific able to get bombers into the air and keep fighters
alongside them fueled up and ready to go. Although the US with its highest military
budget, and maintains the largest number of military bases around the globe, and the largest
number of troops in foreign countries, and keeps the largest number of alliances, yet
may avoid a direct military confrontation in the South China Sea. It does not mean that the US will give up,
but, may exert political and diplomatic pressure, or opt for cold war strategies. The US is very well aware of the consequences
and scared of spreading the conflict into other parts of the world, initiating the third
world war. It might be a nuclear war and disaster for
the whole world. And I hope that never happens! Subscribe to this channel, hit the like button

The Akune brothers: Siblings on opposite sides of war - Wendell Oshiro,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-akune-brothers-siblings-on-opposite-sides-of-war-wendell-oshiro

There are many stories that can be told about World War II, from the tragic to the inspiring. But perhaps one of the most heart-rending experiences was that of the Akune family, divided by the war against each other, and against their own identities. Wendell Oshiro tells the surprising story of this family split apart by war. 

Lesson by Wendell Oshiro, animation by Brandon Denmark.",2015-07-21T15:15:20Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,294.0,1923374,38356,0,1226,2023-11-07T11:05:04.328459,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/de56W-F93nw/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,de56W-F93nw,"There are many stories
that can be told about World War II, from the tragic to the inspring. But perhaps one 
of the most heartrending experiences was that of the Akune family, divided by the war against each other
and against their own identities. Ichiro Akune and his wife Yukiye immigrated to America
from Japan in 1918 in search of opportunity, opening a small grocery store
in central California and raising nine children. But when Mrs. Akune died in 1933, the children were sent to live
with relatives in Japan, their father following soon after. Though the move was a difficult adjustment after having been born 
and raised in America, the oldest son, Harry, formed a close bond
with his grand uncle, who taught him the Japanese language,
culture and values. Nevertheless, as soon as Harry
and his brother Ken were old enough to work, they returned to the country
they considered home, settling near Los Angeles. But then, December 7, 1941,
the attack on Pearl Harbor. Now at war with Japan, the United States government
did not trust the loyalty of those citizens who had family
or ancestral ties to the enemy country. In 1942, about 120,000 Japanese Americans
living on the West Coast were stripped of their civil rights and forcibly relocated 
to internment camps, even though most of them, 
like Harry and Ken, were Nisei, American or dual citizens 
who had been born in the US to Japanese immigrant parents. The brothers not only had very limited
contact with their family in Japan, but found themselves confined
to a camp in a remote part of Colorado. But their story took another twist when recruiters from the US Army's
military intelligence service arrived at the camp looking for
Japanese-speaking volunteers. Despite their treatment by the government, Harry and Ken jumped 
at the chance to leave the camp and prove their loyalty 
as American citizens. Having been schooled in Japan, they soon began their service, translating captured documents, interrogating Japanese soldiers, and producing Japanese 
language propaganda aimed at persuading 
enemy forces to surrender. The brothers' work was invaluable
to the war effort, providing vital strategic information about the size 
and location of Japanese forces. But they still faced discrimination
and mistrust from their fellow soldiers. Harry recalled an instance where his combat gear 
was mysteriously misplaced just prior to parachuting 
into enemy territory, with the white officer reluctant
to give him a weapon. Nevertheless, both brothers 
continued to serve loyally through the end of the war. But Harry and Ken were not the only Akune
brothers fighting in the Pacific. Unbeknownst to them, two younger brothers, the third and fourth 
of the five Akune boys, were serving dutifully 
in the Imperial Japanese Navy, Saburo in the Naval Airforce, and 15-year-old Shiro as
an orientation trainer for new recruits. When the war ended, Harry and Ken
served in the allied occupational forces and were seen as traitors by the locals. When all the Akune brothers
gathered at a family reunion in Kagoshima for 
the first time in a decade, it was revealed that the two pairs
had fought on opposing sides. Tempers flared 
and a fight almost broke out until their father stepped in. The brothers managed to make peace and Saburo and Shiro joined
Harry and Ken in California, and later fought for the US Army in Korea. It took until 1988 for the US government to acknowledge the injustice 
of its internment camps and approve reparations payments
to survivors. For Harry, though, his greatest regret
was not having the courage to thank his Japanese grand uncle
who had taught him so much. The story of the Akune brothers 
is many things: a family divided by circumstance, the unjust treatment

The doctor I asked earlier today before the break. Then what happened to the bodies of the patients so that they were withdrawn and so on, but it turned out to be true, according to them, that's what they said. Firstly, we have to remember here that what is seen as healing is not necessarily what is happening. In fact, we have to remember that when a condition in the body has changed and it takes a long time to be forced to straighten, there are muscle conditions, nerve conditions, joint conditions and other conditions.  the condition of other tissues can actually become more damaged there, actually. So maybe in this drawing it will look straighter, but after that, functionally, it might lose its function, become limp, become shriveled, or yes, it may even be straighter but change shape, well, that's what isn't.  That's what we don't expect here, we have to remember that all treatment must be personal from person to person, so don't force everyone to be straightened or treated in this way, you can't because something that is generalized won't achieve good results.  OK, this is the next thing, I don't know whether it could be something to worry about or not. Maybe if people see this, they would prefer to get treatment like this rather than actually going to a doctor rather than an official medical one. Well, what should be done first for an evaluation? Formal health services in hospitals at clinics, Community Health Centers and others means that when health workers, especially medical staff, provide care, the service must be communicative, must be adaptive and also understand local culture, but the approach remains clinical and scientific or evidence based magazine. So, so on the service  Formally, in this hospital, all forms of communication and therapy rigidity towards patients must be minimized so that they are adaptive and vaccines are felt by health workers, especially doctors, in this case, for example, orthopedics, for example, yes, but on the other hand, there are traditional practices that have been acquired from generation to generation. experience, which means whether the process has been recognized, we don't necessarily reject it, the government analyzes it, it just needs to be directed, whether practices like this can be given some kind of place, then identified with permission, then the process is also seen and in the end it also combines specific culture and experience, including use. traditional medicines that have been handed down from generation to generation with the modern scientific and clinical approach, this is what causes the current combination in terms of formal health services that must be culturally adaptive, but from a traditional perspective it must also be able to be shifted to the scientific aspect, which is also gradual. must be managed in accordance with security and also patient safety procedures. This is the most important thing right there. Princess, patient safety procedures are number one. God willing, what we are discussing tonight can bring benefits to society so that society can also know everything. What must be done for safety  himself when he then experienced the criteria and so on. Thank you for being there after the day. Thank you for being there.

Yana here, welcome to Ask A Teacher, where I'll answer some of your most common Hebrew questions. The question for this lesson is just what is the difference between biblical and Modern Hebrew? Now you may be attracted to Hebrew for any number of reasons Perhaps you want to communicate with friends or family or maybe you've interested in studying the many religious and classical texts? Written in Hebrew Depending on your reasons for learning Hebrew, you may end up learning one of two very different languages. Biblical or classical Hebrew was an ancient language that first emerged in the 10th century BC. Over the next centuries, the ancient Hebrew people used it to communicate and to take a record of their history, religion, philosophy, poetry and Culture. A portion of this literally record formed the basis of Hebrew Scriptures and also what came to be called the Bible. During the Roman period, The language evolved beyond recognition and later fell out of use in Daily life. But it lived on in religious contexts. Hebrew experienced a revival in the late 19th century as part of the larger zionist movement Thanks to the effort of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, who prepared the first Modern Hebrew dictionary, people started using Hebrew again to communicate with one another as they went about their lives. But because of the influence of European languages Hebrew changed grammar pronunciation vocabulary Not a single aspect of the language went untouched by the transformation unlike any other Modern language Hebrew continues to change So for example the word I or me in biblical Hebrew is 'Annokhi' This same word has changed in Modern Hebrew to 'Anni' besides this change in pronunciation, Modern Hebrew got a lot of new words from languages like French and German. For, example the word concrete or Baton came from French, while Schnitzel or Schnitzel came from German, and of course, there are new words to describe things that did not exist in ancient times like electricity Hashmaal computer mahshev car mehonith telephone telefone At this point in history, Someone familiar only with biblical Hebrew would not be able to communicate very well with contemporary native speakers. At the same time, a Modern Hebrew speaker cannot easily read the Bible. How was it? Pretty interesting, right? Do you have any more questions? Leave them in the comments below and I'll try to answer them. להתראות

senior National correspondent Terry Moran has more good morning Terry good morning Lindsay Supreme Court Justices are often invited to travel around the world to teach to attend conferences to visit with friends but the lavishness and the frequency of the vacations that Justice Clarence Thomas has accepted as gifts from a powerful friend have no known precedent in recent Supreme Court history island hopping on a super yacht in Indonesia all male Retreats at an exclusive California Club fishing at a private Resort in the Adirondacks for more than two decades Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has reportedly enjoyed luxury travel virtually every year sometimes traveling the world aboard a private jet with a Dallas billionaire Republican Mega donor without disclosing any of it to the public an expensive secret that is now Landing the conservative Justice in hot water the travel reported by the non-profit journalism Outlet propublica never appeared in Thomas's Financial disclosures Thomas's host real estate magnate Harlan Crowe has not had any Direct business before the court but his gifts and his access to the Court's most senior conservative member have sparked concern Thomas and the Supreme Court have not commented but in the past Thomas has portrayed himself as a man of simple tastes I prefer the RV parks I prefer the wall Walmart parking lots to the beaches and things like that [Music] there's something normal to me about it I've come from regular stock in a statement Harlan Crowe said he and Justice Thomas have been close friends since 1996 and they never discussed pending cases adding he never sought to influence Thomas calling the trips no different from the hospitality we've extended to our many other dear friends the Supreme Court has no formal code of ethics and no enforcement mechanism for any potential wrongdoing Congressional Democrats are calling to change that there's absolutely no reason why the Supreme Court shouldn't be subject to a code of conduct just like every other federal judge Chief Justice John Roberts has made clear in the past he doesn't think Congress has the Constitutional authority to impose conduct rules on the justices instead the chief justice has asked his colleagues to quote consult with the rules for lower court judges George okay Terry thanks very much it's good morning this from our chief legal analyst Dan Abram so I guess the question now is is that law going to be tested the one that does require disclosure of trips like this yeah I mean look is this an ethical violation sure is it a technical violation of the law that applies to federal judges it sure seems it is but now the question is okay so what now as Terry pointed out the Supreme Court has never even formally accepted the idea that the justices are subject to those particular laws and even if they are the question is what is the enforcement mechanism who is going to punish them as of right now it seems the only real way to punish a Supreme Court Justice in a case like this is through impeachment and I think what would surprise so many people is that the Supreme Court Justices don't even have ethics guidelines that apply to lower courts exactly right so their position as of right now is yes these laws apply to the lower courts yes all the federal judges have to apply to this and you know we we know that those things take a look at it yeah yeah exactly we know that they're out there and they're important Etc and you know we're going to consult with them but it's sort of crazy right the idea that the the most important justices who you would think are the mo the ones that people would want to influence the most where ethics would matter the most don't feel that they are necessarily subject to the same laws and again the question is what happens you think the Chief Justice will feel enough pressure to even come out and say anything nope I think that it's going to require at least another step here meaning Congress is going to have to hold hearings or something's going to have to happen because as of right now Justice Thomas isn't talking um Justice Roberts isn't talking and I don't know that they're going to because of the the way that there is this lack of enforcement well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so

"Mother of missing Texas 6-year-old boy told family member she sold him, warrant states","Police in Everman, Texas, have been investigating Noel Rodriguez-Alvarez's disappearance since March 20, 2023.",2023-04-05T23:24:13Z,UCBu0KdNokE4MqdkacvH37_A,News & Politics,127.0,491915,5593,0,1175,2023-11-07T11:05:02.795589,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TkY4Eq1BD1Q/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society,TkY4Eq1BD1Q,"Here we begin with breaking news. In the search for a six year old boy who went missing in Everman, a relative claims his mom told her she sold her son at a grocery store. And that's just one of the disturbing details now coming to light as we get our first look at a search warrant in Tarrant County. Detectives say Noelle Rodriguez Alvarez's family left town 48 hours before an Amber Alert was issued. Almost two weeks ago, his mother, stepfather and six of his siblings boarded a flight to Turkey. And then traveled on to India. Little Noel was not listed on that flight. I want to get to Sydney person in our newsroom. You just got your hands on that warrant. What does it say, Izzy, this is a big story. People have tons of questions and up until now virtually had no answers. Details in this newly obtained search warrant, though, could answer some. According to the court document, Cindy Rodriguez Singh, Noelle's mother, told her mother she sold her son to someone at a Fiesta market store. Relatives. And Rodriguez seeing abused Noel even told someone in her family once not to give her son any water because she didn't want to clean up after his dirty diaper. The document also says another relative told police he saw Rodriguez Singh hit no well with car keys attached to a lanyard. Now we already know from police Rodriguez seeing her husband and their other children boarded a flight to India, as you mentioned without Noel back in March. This warrant though now reveals Rodriguez Singh first applied for those passports. For her children in November and she never even applied for a passport for Noel. The warrant also states Rodriguez Singh did not take her son to a scheduled medical appointment. That was back in October. Now police obtained this search warrant to access specific items, financial and medical documents, clothing, cell phones, laptop, physical evidence of injuries or abuse. I really want to reiterate here, we just talked with the police chief moments ago and he stressed his officers have not found any evidence. To support that claim that Noel was sold at a Fiesta mark."

Yiddish and Hebrew are often thought to be closely related languages because of their shared script, and because they are both connected with the Jewish people. But the truth is that Yiddish and Hebrew and basically unrelated to each other. Hebrew is a Semitic language, most closely related with Arabic, while Yiddish is a Germanic language most closely related to German.

So I can talk to Grandma. [Klezmer music] Good day, guys. This is just a quick video
 to answer a question that I got. And I decided to make it into a video
 because I've had this question before and maybe, it's something that 
a lot of people are wondering. The question is : 
""Are Hebrew and Yiddish similar?"" Or ""are Hebrew and Yiddish kind of the same language?"" The answer to that is ""No"". 
They are different languages. They are often confused with each other because
the Yiddish language is written in the Hebrew alphabet, in the same way that Farsi or Urdu 
are written in the Arabic alphabet, or that German is written 
in the Roman alphabet just like English is. So someone who doesn't read that script might look
at it  and think that it's the same language. But Hebrew and Yiddish are different. Another reason they might be confused is 
that they are both related to Jewish people. But they're related to Jewish people 
in different ways, so... Hebrew is the old language of the Bible,
of the Old Testament, of the Hebrew Bible - as they would call it -, the Torah. And it's also been a literary language 
of Jews throughout the centuries. Often, for religious purposes or literary reasons, 
they would write in Hebrew. But it was just a literary language for a long time.
It died as a spoken language. But Yiddish was spoken by Jews in Europe. And it's... The language it's mostly related to is German.
It's kind of a medieval form of German. But I understand that, to some extent, Yiddish speakers
can communicate with German speakers. And they can understand each other.
Not fully, but to some extent. So it's mostly related to German, but it's been influenced 
by Hebrew in terms of vocabulary. And also by Aramaic 
and maybe some other languages too. Because Hebrew and Aramaic were
 Jewish literary languages. So there is some Hebrew vocabulary in it,
but I think the pronunciation has kind of
been changed and more Germanized. So it doesn't sound like Hebrew so much. So Yiddish was influenced by Hebrew 
to some extent though. And also Modern Hebrew 
was influenced by Yiddish because... the original Zionists who came to Palestine,
to create a Jewish state, they were Yiddish speakers, I think, Yiddish,
 maybe Russian or whatever. But their native language, Yiddish, maybe also Russian 
and others influenced Modern Hebrew. So people say that Modern Hebrew syntax and phonology 
reflects the Yiddish language to some extent. So Yiddish has influenced Modern Hebrew as well, 
but basically, they're separate languages. And you can't communicate with someone 
who speaks the other. It would be easier for a Yiddish speaker to communicate 
with someone who speaks German, I think. Alright, so... Hopefully that is helpful. 
And just a quick whole answer to that question. Aright, talk to you later... [Klezmer music]"
Russia 'gains ground in 80%' Bakhmut; Wagner parades captured U.S. armoured vehicle | Watch,"Russia’s Wagner forces are gaining ground in the fiercely contested battle for Bakhmut.

What makes a truly great logo,"Here's how a simple mark ends up meaning something big as a great logo. Joe Posner, and Michael Bierut (designer of the Hillary Clinton logo) explain.

About once a month, there's a new logo to fight about on the internet. The biggest one in recent memory was the highly controversial Hillary Clinton logo, which did not escape scrutiny from Vox.com either. 

But as a designer/filmmaker, something about these repeated discussions struck me as missing the point on what makes logos tick. It often has little to do with the subjective musings. So I called up Michael Bierut, the designer of that Hillary Clinton logo and countless others. He sat down with me and helped explain the elements of a great logo in the video above.

I'm a graphic designer” You might be familiar
with is work, but interestingly he thinks that logos are just kind of overrated. ""I'm actually often very ambivalent about
them."" Let’s back out a second. What is a logo? Basically a face of a company. ""Some are beloved. Some... the swastika is a logo and it's reviled. You know?"" They have to work at tiny sizes, and huge. There are three specific types. First type is the Wordmark. ""the wordmark is the easiest one. And it's the one we're all the most familiar
with. I mean John Hancock's signature is kind of
a word mark. It can look crisp clean and modern like the
new Google logo looks. Or it can look somehow that it has roots in
a shared heritage the way the coca cola logo looks. You know?"" The second is PICTORAL. ""Pictoral logos often function as a kind of
rebus. It's a picture, and it's identifying the name
of the company. Sometimes directly like Target. Sometimes indirectly like LaCoste."" The third kind is kind of the holy grail. Abstract inconography. ""The third type is favorite kind of category
because it just seems almost like magic."" As a designer people will come to me and they'll
say I want something like the Nike swoosh. They think the Nike swoosh was the Nike Swoosh
the day it was drawn. But it was nothing the day it was drawn."" The company that birthed nike commissioned
a design student named Carolyn to draw some ideas. The Nike founders didn't really like it. ""They sort of said awww let’s use that one."" It wasn’t an overnight success. And then they started putting it on the sides
of shoes. The shoes were good and then the genius of
Nike's marketing apparatus made us further associate that product not merely with performance
athletic gear but with the very idea of athletic achievement itself. And that's how over a long time a little mark
means something big. ""That’s exactly how religious symbols work
– it’s obviously not just anything inherent in about these shapes, but what these shapes
have come to represent in the minds of the people who are looking at them."" But there's a fourth type of logo that goes
beyond these three types, and can use elements of each of them: The Logo System. A kind of framework, but one that can have
endless permutations. The first huge, popular example of the logo
system would be MTV. But google’s daily “doodles” are another
great example the logo system – a familiar mark that also can point to other ideas and
issues. This approach all has to do with technological
change. ""It used to be if a company was doing a logo
there'd be this military operation by which it would be inscribed on all their equipment
and on their airplanes and their retail facilities and gold pins and cufflinks would be made
for the executive suite and put on spitoons in ashtrays, the top of the skyscraper, and
everyone’s business card. Right? Nowadays none of that’s important as an
email signature or your twitter avatar or the little thing that sits next to your URL. Those things are much more ubiquitous and
they can be changed at the drop of a hat.” Bierut used this system approach for his Hillary
Clinton logo. ""we wanted to have a mark that could reflect
the electorate, and reflect the issues. The simple forms that comprise the H with
the arrow in it are actually designed to hold not just two colors such as red and blue,
but any colors you want"" The use of logo systems seems to be continually on the upswing – probably
because it allows the the brand using it to expand the conversation beyond it’s own
name. ""The logo really reminds people that’s what
our priority is today."" But at the end of the day, regardless of the
shape, style or system, it might not matter what the logo is. ""It really is about thinking of these symbols
as being empty vessels in a way. And then you pour the meaning into them. Some vessels are better at holding one kind
of meaning."" So what’s this all add up to? Basically, those fights people get in about
new logos are pretty misguided. ""They think they’re judging a diving competition,
but actually all these organizations are in swimming competitions. It’s not what kind of splash you make when
you hit the water. It’s about how long you can keep your head
above that water."" Logos need to have a long life, not win points
in a discussion. 12 years after the birth of the nike logo,
Nike came back to that graphic design student Carolyn with a gift ""A Nike ring with her
own trademark on it, the swoosh. Thank you very much it's beautiful."" And an undisclosed amount of Nike stock. ""Wow."" In 1973 when it was designed, her was $35."
Israel reminds Iran's intervention,"Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who had tried to be stopped by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, ended his visit to the western edge occupied area while reminding Iran's interference.

Last week, Gallant was fired from his position by Netanyahu because the minister opposed the course of judicial reforms in the government.Gallant never received a formal dismissal letter from Netanyahu, and the dismissal triggered vigilance in foreign countries and demonstrations.

"Bakhmut: The Bloodiest Battle of the Ukraine War, Explained | WSJ","Ukraine and Russia have been engaged in grueling fighting for months over control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian soldiers still fighting for the city say they are wearing down Russian assault forces.

WSJ explains why this city with its challenging terrain has turned into the bloodiest and one of the longest battles of the Ukraine war.

Ukrainian City of Bakhmut in summer 2022, and this is what it looked
like half a year later. Moscow has been trying to
take Bakhmut since last July, turning it into the sight
of the bloodiest fight of Russia's war in Ukraine. While some military analysts
and Western officials have debated how important the city is to the overall conflict,
both Moscow and Kyiv have doubled down on
their military operations. (Sergei speaking Russian) (Volodymyr speaking Ukrainian) - [Narrator] Here's how Bakhmut turned into a political symbol
for Kyiv and Moscow and why this battle has been
so difficult for both sides. (upbeat music) Located in the highly
contested Donetsk region, Bakhmut wasn't an obvious spot on the map to become one of the
focal points of the war. The city does sit on a
number of major roads, linking it to strategically
important locations in the region. But Bakhmut itself isn't a
significant transportation hub according to some military analysts, and the city's hilly terrain
makes it a difficult place to advance from. - If the Russians do
eventually take Bakhmut, they'll have to go over higher ground and the Ukrainians have had plenty of time to build highly defensible
positions there. - [Narrator] Some of those positions are in the town of Chasiv Yar that sits on a hill around six miles west where Ukrainians have
been digging trenches. More can be found further west
in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the heavily fortified Ukrainian
strongholds in Donetsk. - [Stephen] It's not gonna be easy for the Russians from now on
even if they take the the city. - [Narrator] This makes it
unlikely that taking control of the city would be a
turning point for Russia. So why have both sides
continued to fight for the city? Ukrainian commanders say they aim to exhaust Russian forces
there and give themselves time to prepare for offensives of their own, and for Russia, the battle has turned into a defining moment for Wagner, the mercenary group that
spearheaded the Russian offensive. Thanks to them, the region
surrounding the city is one of the few places where Moscow has made any major
progress since last summer. But to do this, the group has invested almost
its entire supply of recruits, sending waves of soldiers
to near certain death. In March, a UK military advisor estimated that between 20,000 and
30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded
in the area around Bakhmut since the start of the offensive. - Bakhmut has developed a
symbolic significance far greater than the operational or strategic
significance of the city. - [Narrator] And military
analysts say Ukraine's losses, which are classified, are also increasing. Russian and Ukrainian military
officials didn't respond to our request for comment on the number of casualties
they've suffered in Bakhmut. (upbeat music) Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has come under criticism at home for deciding to defend Fortress

"Bakhmut: The Bloodiest Battle of the Ukraine War, Explained | WSJ","Ukraine and Russia have been engaged in grueling fighting for months over control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian soldiers still fighting for the city say they are wearing down Russian assault forces.

WSJ explains why this city with its challenging terrain has turned into the bloodiest and one of the longest battles of the Ukraine war.

Russia-Ukraine Conflict
WSJ’s latest news coverage around the 2022-2023 Russia-Ukraine conflict.

#Bakhmut #Ukraine #WSJ",2023-04-03T13:51:25Z,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ,News & Politics,234.0,671014,5121,0,1354,2023-11-07T11:05:17.933138,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cJGAFHbBGpg/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",cJGAFHbBGpg,"(upbeat music) - [Narrator] This is the eastern
Ukrainian City of Bakhmut in summer 2022, and this is what it looked
like half a year later. Moscow has been trying to
take Bakhmut since last July, turning it into the sight
of the bloodiest fight of Russia's war in Ukraine. While some military analysts
and Western officials have debated how important the city is to the overall conflict,
both Moscow and Kyiv have doubled down on
their military operations. (Sergei speaking Russian) (Volodymyr speaking Ukrainian) - [Narrator] Here's how Bakhmut turned into a political symbol
for Kyiv and Moscow and why this battle has been
so difficult for both sides. (upbeat music) Located in the highly
contested Donetsk region, Bakhmut wasn't an obvious spot on the map to become one of the
focal points of the war. The city does sit on a
number of major roads, linking it to strategically
important locations in the region. But Bakhmut itself isn't a
significant transportation hub according to some military analysts, and the city's hilly terrain
makes it a difficult place to advance from. - If the Russians do
eventually take Bakhmut, they'll have to go over higher ground and the Ukrainians have had plenty of time to build highly defensible
positions there. - [Narrator] Some of those positions are in the town of Chasiv Yar that sits on a hill around six miles west where Ukrainians have
been digging trenches. More can be found further west
in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, the heavily fortified Ukrainian
strongholds in Donetsk. - [Stephen] It's not gonna be easy for the Russians from now on
even if they take the the city. - [Narrator] This makes it
unlikely that taking control of the city would be a
turning point for Russia. So why have both sides
continued to fight for the city? Ukrainian commanders say they aim to exhaust Russian forces
there and give themselves time to prepare for offensives of their own, and for Russia, the battle has turned into a defining moment for Wagner, the mercenary group that
spearheaded the Russian offensive. Thanks to them, the region
surrounding the city is one of the few places where Moscow has made any major
progress since last summer. But to do this, the group has invested almost
its entire supply of recruits, sending waves of soldiers
to near certain death. In March, a UK military advisor estimated that between 20,000 and
30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded
in the area around Bakhmut since the start of the offensive. - Bakhmut has developed a
symbolic significance far greater than the operational or strategic
significance of the city. - [Narrator] And military
analysts say Ukraine's losses, which are classified, are also increasing. Russian and Ukrainian military
officials didn't respond to our request for comment on the number of casualties
they've suffered in Bakhmut. (upbeat music) Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has come under criticism at home for deciding to defend Fortress
Bakhmut as he called it, despite mounting deaths. But in late March, Western officials and some military analysts
said Russia's offensive in Bakhmut was losing momentum. - It may be that the Russians have effectively exhausted themselves or it may be that the
Russians are just pausing, hoping to resupply and go at
it again with one final push. - [Narrator] Despite questions about the city's strategic importance, the large number of troops and ammunition that both sides have
poured into the battle has created a military
significance of its own. - The next thing really to watch will be what happens when
Ukrainian forces re-equipped with Western tanks and other
sophisticated equipment and try to take back more
land occupied by the Russians."

Welcome to Fun Science Demos. This should look familiar. It is our home. It is the planet Earth - or it is a model of the planet Earth. And it shows us what we see. We see continents, we see oceans, it shows us that the Earth spins. But there is one thing that this model cannot show us. It cannot show us what is on the inside of the earth. I press on this, and it is hollow. But through science, we have discovered that the earth is not hollow. Through science we have discovered what is inside the earth. So what is
inside the earth? Well, when I look at my model, I see continents and ocean. But what you cannot see, is underneath the continents and ocean is a crust. A crust that covers the whole
earth. And underneath the crust is a warmer
layer called the mantle. And then underneath the mantle is this hot inner core, right at the center. So let us take a
closer look inside the earth. Underneath all the continents and the ocean there is the crust and it is important to remember that the crust is actually broken into pieces or plates. It is not just the one, there are many
pieces or plates. Through science we have discovered that all those pieces and plates actually move. Now in another video we talked about why those plates move. Today we want to talk about what happens when those plates move. So we are going to zoom in and take a
closer look, so you can see what happens when those plates move. To do that, to show you that, we are going to use spray cheese to actually be the mantle right under
the crust - and then we are going to use graham crackers to be the crust. So first we need to lay down the mantle,
the part right under the crust. And to do that I am just
going to spray some of this cheese. It is important to remember that this
mantle is hot, and parts of the mantle are moving. And then we have the crust. The crust sits on top of the mantle in pieces or plates. And because parts of the mantle are
moving, that means parts of my crust are moving, and that is what we want to
look at. Remember that continents and oceans are sitting on top of this crust and those plates are moving - and one way those plates can move is, those plates can actually move apart. When they move apart, that mantle actually forms new crust. And when the plates move apart this is
happening under the ocean. Actually new crust is a added as those
plates move apart. Right here as the plates move apart the
mantle cools down and it forms new crust. So we have seen
that plates can actually move apart, but let us take a closer look at what
happens when plates slide past each other. Okay so we have zoomed in so we can take a closer look at what happens when the plates slide past each other. Watch what happens as I slide the plates past each other. It is important to
remember it is not a smooth ride. It is actually quite bumpy. In fact that bumpy ride as plates slide
past each other that is what creates earthquakes. So we have talked about what happens when plates move apart, and what happens when plates move past each other. Well what happens when plates bump into each other? So we have zoomed in again to see what happens when one plate collides with another. What happens when the plates come together and collide? One plate goes under and the other plate stays on top. Take a look at that plate
that is going under the other one. That plate will actually melt because
it is so hot in the mantle. So so far we have taken a look at what
happens to the crust when the plates move under the ocean.
Well what happens when those plates move and there is a continent on top of the
crust? Okay we have zoomed in. We have our mantle, we have our crust, let us add some continents. What happens when the plates move
together and collide when there is a continent on top? Well, watch what happens. As the plates collide, the continents collide, and I am going to push, and what do you see happening? So what is that? What did we just make? Well, actually this is the way moving plates make mountains. The earth is an amazing place! It is always changing because those plates are moving. Those moving plates make earthquakes happen, they make mountains, they even make volcanoes. If you want to learn more about earth and its geology check out our other videos, or check out the links in our video description. Science is so cool! the earth is so cool,
and sometimes it is even tasty. Thanks for watching!"

Finland became the 31st member of the Western defence alliance on Tuesday morning, in a significant blow to Russia.

Russia and Finland share a 1,300 kilometre border and Moscow has already said it will beef up military divisions stationed in its west and northwest in response to Finland’s membership in NATO.

Russia claims it is fighting a “hybrid war” against NATO and the West, which is backing Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid and financial support. 

In St. Petersburg, known as Russia’s “northern capital,” residents disapproved of Finland joining NATO and said the Nordic country was “making problems for itself.”

“We used to consider it a brotherly country of the capitalist world, the closest to us in spirit, in relations, in mutually-beneficial economic relations. But now we will consider it as a state that is unfriendly to us,” said one resident, Nikolai.

St. Petersburg is about 150 kilometres from the Finnish border.

Below you will find our sun. Our star is 2
octillion tons of hot hydrogen gas emitting 400 septillion joules of energy every second.
The hottest part of the sun is its 15 million°C core, where it's been fusing hydrogen into
helium for the past 4.6 billions years. Despite that, it's only considered a middle aged star! Now let’s check out the closest planet to
our sun, Mercury. Orbiting the sun in just 88 days, Mercury also has the most elliptical
orbit of any planet. It spins very slowly, once every 2/3 of its orbital period. Despite its
surface reaching a blistering 430°C, it still has water ice in permanently shadowed craters near its
poles, where the temperatures stay below -170° C. The next planet in our solar system is Venus.
It’s the planet with the hottest surface temperature; at 460°C it’s hot enough to
melt lead. Its air is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide, with a thick layer of sulfuric
clouds. Its rotational axis is flipped upside-down, which means that the planet spins backwards. The third and best understood planet is Earth.
Our home planet has a dense metal core, a thick viscous rock mantle, and a thin crust.
It's unique in the solar system for having humans and permanent liquid water on its surface.
Other planets may get the former soon. At 3470 km in diameter, our Moon has the largest
moon-to-planet size ratio. It's thought to have formed when a small planet impacted Earth
at a grazing angle billions of years ago. It’s heavily cratered, and has huge flood
plains on it called maria. Next up in our system is Mars. Its iconic
red color comes from its rusty rocks and dust. In the past Mars was once very wet, with oceans,
a thick atmosphere, and a warmer climate. But its lack of a magnetic field meant no protection
from the solar wind, which eroded its atmosphere away. Between Mars and Jupiter is a large asteroid belt. It’s a ring shaped region containing rubble leftover
from the formation of the planets. Past the asteroid belt we find our systems
Jovian planets, starting with Jupiter. A gas giant, it’s the largest planet in our solar
system. It has a dynamic atmosphere, including belts, zones, and a gigantic red spot created
by a persistent hurricane. The Great Red Spot is a persistent anticyclonic storm. The spot
is large enough to contain three Earth-sized planets. It’s still unclear what exactly
gives the spot its red color. The next planet in our system is Saturn. It’s
a gas giant with a broad set of rings. It has a hexagonal cloud pattern on its north
pole. It's the least dense of all the planets, even less dense than water! Made up of ice
particles, Saturn’s rings are 250,000 km across, but only 10 meters thick! Gaps in the rings are created
the gravitational tugging of the moons orbiting Saturn. Uranus is an ice giant with a small rocky core and
a thick mantle of ammonia, water, and methane. It also has thirteen distinct rings. Uranus
has a huge tilt -- 98°, with respect to its orbit. A massive glancing collision long ago is one
hypothesis to explain the extreme tilt. Technically considered the last planet in
our solar system, Neptune is an ice giant, with a similar composition to Uranus. It’s
the most dense of the outer planets and the only planet found by mathematical prediction
rather than by empirical observation. At the outer edges of our solar system we find the
Kuiper Belt, filled with smaller rocky and icy bodies. Pluto is in this region. It was originally discovered
in 1930 and categorized as a planet, but it was recategorized as a minor planet in 2006. And there you go -- a crash course on our solar system.

Below you will find our sun. Our star is 2
octillion tons of hot hydrogen gas emitting 400 septillion joules of energy every second.
The hottest part of the sun is its 15 million°C core, where it's been fusing hydrogen into
helium for the past 4.6 billions years. Despite that, it's only considered a middle aged star! Now let’s check out the closest planet to
our sun, Mercury. Orbiting the sun in just 88 days, Mercury also has the most elliptical
orbit of any planet. It spins very slowly, once every 2/3 of its orbital period. Despite its
surface reaching a blistering 430°C, it still has water ice in permanently shadowed craters near its
poles, where the temperatures stay below -170° C. The next planet in our solar system is Venus.
It’s the planet with the hottest surface temperature; at 460°C it’s hot enough to
melt lead. Its air is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide, with a thick layer of sulfuric
clouds. Its rotational axis is flipped upside-down, which means that the planet spins backwards. The third and best understood planet is Earth.
Our home planet has a dense metal core, a thick viscous rock mantle, and a thin crust.
It's unique in the solar system for having humans and permanent liquid water on its surface.
Other planets may get the former soon. At 3470 km in diameter, our Moon has the largest
moon-to-planet size ratio. It's thought to have formed when a small planet impacted Earth
at a grazing angle billions of years ago. It’s heavily cratered, and has huge flood
plains on it called maria. Next up in our system is Mars. Its iconic
red color comes from its rusty rocks and dust. In the past Mars was once very wet, with oceans,
a thick atmosphere, and a warmer climate. But its lack of a magnetic field meant no protection
from the solar wind, which eroded its atmosphere away. Between Mars and Jupiter is a large asteroid belt. It’s a ring shaped region containing rubble leftover
from the formation of the planets. Past the asteroid belt we find our systems
Jovian planets, starting with Jupiter. A gas giant, it’s the largest planet in our solar
system. It has a dynamic atmosphere, including belts, zones, and a gigantic red spot created
by a persistent hurricane. The Great Red Spot is a persistent anticyclonic storm. The spot
is large enough to contain three Earth-sized planets. It’s still unclear what exactly
gives the spot its red color. The next planet in our system is Saturn. It’s
a gas giant with a broad set of rings. It has a hexagonal cloud pattern on its north
pole. It's the least dense of all the planets, even less dense than water! Made up of ice
particles, Saturn’s rings are 250,000 km across, but only 10 meters thick! Gaps in the rings are created
the gravitational tugging of the moons orbiting Saturn. Uranus is an ice giant with a small rocky core and
a thick mantle of ammonia, water, and methane. It also has thirteen distinct rings. Uranus
has a huge tilt -- 98°, with respect to its orbit. A massive glancing collision long ago is one
hypothesis to explain the extreme tilt. Technically considered the last planet in
our solar system, Neptune is an ice giant, with a similar composition to Uranus. It’s
the most dense of the outer planets and the only planet found by mathematical prediction
rather than by empirical observation. At the outer edges of our solar system we find the
Kuiper Belt, filled with smaller rocky and icy bodies. Pluto is in this region. It was originally discovered
in 1930 and categorized as a planet, but it was recategorized as a minor planet in 2006. And there you go -- a crash course on our solar system.
Even though we've explored a lot of it, there's still a huge amount left to discover. And that's the beauty
of science: there's always more to learn. Thank you so much for watching! This video

"China & Russia Build 'New World Order', the United States was asked to be immediately aware of the threat","TRIBUN-VIDEO.COM - Many speculation that the end of Western hegemony is likely to be close, with civil riots raging throughout Europe and banks collapsed in the United States (US) and Switzerland.

Journalists, historians and writers Jon Jeter and researchers as well as historical professors at the University of Houston, Dr.Gerald also discussed the opportunities and risks of the new world.

The closer relationship between Russia and China not only marked the new 'world order', but also brought the risk that the US would face a military confrontation between nuclear powers.

The historic high -level Russian conference between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping only wiped the rhetoric coming from the US, Britain and the European Union (EU).

Jon Jter also noted how former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating had criticized the 'aukus' agreement by a nuclear -powered attack submarine from the US and Britain due to the potential for military confrontation with China.

He said that other Australians 'really liked the game'.

According to him, no one can make the US aware of the threat that actually exists in front of this eye.

Quoted from the Sputnik News page, Sunday (3/26/2023), Jeter then referred to a massive protest in France on President Emmanuel Macron's efforts to force an increase in retirement age without parliament voting.

He regretted that 'nothing happened in the US' who thought this was just an ordinary protest.

Even though he hoped that it would be the 'beginning of something', he admitted that the US did not think about the opinions of other parties.

Furthermore, the Ukraine conflict and other events caused Africans to question their relationship with the US, their relationship with Russia, especially China.

According to him, there was a new political shift to the left throughout Latin America.

In Argentina, Brazil with the re -election of Lula Da Silva, of course in Venezuela for more than 20 years.

Meanwhile Dr.Gerald said that Summit Xi Jinping and Putin and Chinese international framework for peace in Ukraine indicate 'We are at the peak of the new world order' which will 'cause the chaos of many existing arrangements'.

This academic notes that the commentator in the US has claimed that the failure of the Russian armed forces to defeat Ukraine in the first few weeks of conflict is 'Loss for Russia'.

He also reminded that it was not always a good sign for the northern Atlantic countries, which might make them try to throw dice in connection with the desire to ignite the war in China.

Dr.Gerald said that people must warn the US that it was a 'suicide pact'.

starts interesting moves from president who's in there well let's zoom out a bit and um I understand the Russian defense minister is visiting Belarus why do you think that is Sergo shogu is today visiting Belarus so it's a face value you understand this is because Belarus is seeking security guarantees because it's worried that if he does get attacked will Russia come to its Aid the trouble is if you look behind the scenes here first of all Ukraine has neither the military capability nor the intent to actually start to take on Belarus and NATO is a defensive organization so it's very

Don't worry, I'll try to get to the place where my friend and I were and then we'll move there and the plan is to live where Sir is, temporarily at his brother's place behind the sub-district, but because Ken is still small, we put Ken's things in the sub-district to wait for later.  looking for a new place that can be found in a suitable place in Indonesia, not yet touching on personal problems, is a retreat from Hermawan's teachings, don't forget to follow like and subscribe on social media"

BUT TODAY, A BIG STEP BACKWARDS. THAT ONLY OPENED A YEAR AGO ABRUPTLY CLOSED DOWN AFTER ANNOUNCING SAFETY CONCERNS . AT MORE THAN 64,000 SQUARE FEET, IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST GROCERY STORES IN THE AREA. IT WAS BUILT AS THE WHOLE FOODS FLAGSHIP LOCATION IN THE CITY. SUPERVISOR MATT DORSEY SAID HE IS SHOCKED THAT THIS WHOLE FOODS DESCENDED INTO CHAOS. IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE IT CLOSE, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS NOT THAT SURPRISING, AND I AM REALLY SADDENED ABOUT THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COME INTO THAT STORE WHO ARE ACTING OUT, WHO ARE ACTIVE IN THEIR DRUG ADDICTIONS AND WHO ARE ROBBING THE STORE BLIND. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THIS STORE OPENED THAT THERE WERE HANDCARTS THAT PEOPLE WOULD USE TO SHOP THERE WERE 250 OF THEM. ALL OF THEM WERE STOLEN. WHOLE FOODS SET MADE THE DECISION TO CLOSE TEMPORARILY, THEY SAID FOR THE TIME BEING, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE STAFF SAFE. THEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO NEARBY LOCATIONS FOR NOW. LEZLA GOODEN WENT TO THE STORE TO ASK HOW SHOPPERS FELT ABOUT IT. Reporter: JENNIFER WILL LIVES JUST ACROSS THE WHOLE FOODS ON EIGHTH AND MARKET STREET.

Reporter: JUST LIKE THAT, JENNIFER AND MANY SHOPPERS AT THIS WHOLE FOODS WILL HAVE TO GO ELSEWHERE TO SHOP.

JENNIFER SAYS THAT SHE NEVER FELT UNSAFE SHOPPING, BUT HAS WITNESSED DISTURBANCES THAT WERE QUICKLY HANDLED. THE CITY. FOR THAT TO CLOSE DOWN, I THINK IT IS A SIGN THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. I THINK IT IS A LOSS FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY OPENED I THINK IT WAS PROMISING AND IT WAS SORT OF LIKE HOPEFUL THAT THERE WOULD BE CHANGE.

US and Philippines begin largest-ever joint military drills after China exercises - BBC News,"The US and the Philippines are holding their largest-ever joint military drills, a day after China concluded large-scale exercises around Taiwan.

The drills will involve more than 17,600 troops.

Over the weekend, China's military rehearsed blockades around Taiwan in response to the country’s leader meeting with the US House Speaker last week.

Plans for the US-Philippines drills predated China’s activities.

At least eight Chinese war ships remain in Taiwanese water.

How tsunamis work - Alex Gendler,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-tsunamis-work-alex-gendler

The immense swell of a tsunami can grow up to 100 feet, hitting speeds over 500 mph -- a treacherous combination for anyone or anything in its path. Alex Gendler details the causes of these towering terrors and explains how scientists are seeking to reduce their destruction in the future.

Lesson by Alex Gendler, animation by Augenblick Studios.",2014-04-24T15:13:29Z,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,Education,217.0,8129852,52090,0,1895,2023-11-07T11:06:08.782767,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wx9vPv-T51I/hqdefault.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,Wx9vPv-T51I,"In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated
much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher
than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed
they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon
that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly
known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated
to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just
larger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is
in where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,
the waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy
originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,
an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates
of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount
of energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above
the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,
a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through
the entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,
something called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water
to move through, this still massive amount
of energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises
to as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,
Japanese for ""harbor wave,"" comes from the fact that it only seems
to appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami
reaches shore first, the water will withdraw
farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown
people near the coast, but level buildings and trees
for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,
the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,
unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest
natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people
throughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves
against this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis
with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami
surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers
are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure
and seismic activity, and establishing global
communication networks for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course
is to get out of its way."

Erdogan echoes India; Lashes Biden for 'meddling' into Turkey's internal affairs | Watch,"The Turkish President has blasted the U.S. for meddling in Turkey's 'internal matters.' President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said we need to teach the U.S. a 'lesson' after its envoy met with a presidential candidate from the main opposition party in Turkey. The alleged 'interference' by Biden comes amid a U.S.-Turkey tussle over NATO expansion. Turkey has finally let Finland into NATO, but it’s not budge yet on Sweden. While Turkey claims to be neutral, its president regularly chats with Vladimir Putin. Turkish President Erdogan's so-called pro-Russia approach has angered the U.S.-led NATO, and 'meddling' by Joe Biden could be the result of that.

is often filled with things that aren't very fun a notable amongst those is disease sometimes it will end the reign of an important monarch sometimes it will stop a war in its tracks but every few centuries there's a major outbreak a pandemic and one of the most notable of these was the influenza outbreak of 1918 better known as the Spanish flu so how did this pandemic play out well first of all it's important to note that there's no definitive answer on where this outbreak actually came from some say it started in a British Army field hospital in France because all those sick people next to each other was a breeding ground for disease some argue that it originated in southern China because the government there had reported a deadly flu there in 1917 and there are others that say it started in Kansas and American soldiers brought it with them to the Western Front what we know for sure is that it definitely didn't start in Spain so why is it called the Spanish flu then well the reason is that during the first world war if the on tonton central power was implemented strict censorship at the press and this included suppressing the flu outbreak because authorities were concerned it would demoralize troops Spain however was a neutral country and so had no censorship and its papers were free to discuss the outbreak of flu which had spread there from France also given that the king of Spain himself got very sick many people only knew about the deadly flu there and had no idea that it was spreading in their own countries hence the name so to summarize the outbreak the Spanish influenza pandemic infected one in three people globally and of those it killed roughly 10% most deaths came from the flu causing pneumonia fortunately though pneumonia could easily be treated by antibiotics unfortunately antibiotics hadn't been invented yet and so you simply had to hope for the best in the end the pandemic reached all corners of the world and killed about 40 to 50 million people globally in the space of a year and to put this into perspective World War one could about twelve million people over the course of four years so the Spanish flu came in three waves and the first one hit in March to April of 1918 but this was the least deadly of all waves by May or June though the flu had largely disappeared until it popped back up in France in late October and it was this second wave which was the big one to put it into perspective in six weeks the illness killed 400,000 people in the United States and 200,000 in Germany and its victims were mostly young adults places like India with the hardest hit though with the death toll there alone being over 10 million people in two months and the third wave occurred around the beginning of 1919 and whilst also deadly wasn't as bad as the previous over the course of two months he killed 70,000 people in Britain and slightly more in Germany after this though the flu just simply well disappeared leaving the world to pick up the pieces and return to a sense of normalcy so how did nations try to stop it well we'll look at Italy's attempt for the answer the first outbreak barely affected the nation and soldiers on the front were only made mildly and well but it was the second wave which began in cesano in September of 1918 that was the devastating one when soldiers on the front started to die in droves the government knew that strict measures had to be taken the problem was that Italy wasn't a hugely developed nation at this point and so food was severely limited by the war effort to medical staff and equipment were prioritized for the army in the end as millions of people became unwell combat medics were sent back and first year medical students were given control of entire hospitals travel between cities was limited but ultimately this wasn't enough to stop its spread the Italian government implemented numerous strategies one advice was given to people to wash their hands often to isolate the sick and to produce contact with their neighbors which was difficult given that people had to kefir rations daily the government conscripted prisoners of war to clean the streets gave police officers face masks and reserved hospitals for only the very sick it banned public gatherings closed schools and bought hospital visitors and it was this aspect no church no seeing sick relatives are no attending their funerals which caused a deep trauma in Italian society reminiscent of the Black Death six centuries earlier like everywhere else the last wave went as quick as the first one came in in Italy the flu killed 600,000 people in six months something many people wonder is that given how destructive the Spanish flu was why isn't it better remembered and for that there are two reasons the first was that it occurred towards the end of the first world war and so that event takes precedence the second was that during this period pandemics were fairly common and people were used to cholera typhoid plague and other diseases ravaging their communities and combined with people being numb to so many young deaths in the war much of the world had become well pretty used to it which is why the Spanish flu was always seen as a footnote to the first world war because too many people at the time it was I hope you enjoyed this episode and thank you for watching with the

The fall of Islamic State,"The biggest, boldest attempt by a jihadist regime to defy the whole world order will be smashed in 2017. Islamic State is set to be driven out of its last remaining territories in Iraq and Syria—but its defeat won't spell the end for terrorism.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

What will be the seismic shifts in the year ahead? The appearance of this outfit convulsed world politics for several years; struck fear into the hearts of people all around the world. Islamic State is the most vicious and murderous jihardist regime the world has ever seen. 

In 2017, it will be smashed. The defeat of Islamic State will be one of the most significant things to happen in 2017. Forces from some 60 countries have taken the fight to Islamic State. It now clings to two key strongholds, one in Iraq and one in Syria.

Controlling territory is what defines Islamic State. Recruits have been drawn from all over the world to fight for its declared domain.

In October 2016, an Iraqi-led force launched a concerted effort to reclaim Mosul. The city is set to fall within months with the Syrian stronghold of Raqqa and a few remaining pockets likely to follow shortly after. But many of the fighters themselves may outlast Islamic State.

For the west too it may prove a pyrrhic victory

Today unfortunately is a sad day within our city. At 8:38 there's a report of shots fired at Old National Bank. Officers were on scene. Within 3 minutes. The suspect shot at officers. We then returned fire and stopped that threat. The suspect is deceased. This is the only time that I will mention the suspect name. In this case the suspect has been identified as Connor Sturgeon, White male, 23 years of age, who was employed at Old National Bank. His weapon of choice was a rifle. We have 5 total decease which includes him, but I want to acknowledge. With heartfelt condolences, prayers to the family of those who lost their life today. Tommy Elliott, 63 years of age, Jim Tuck, 64 years of age, Josh Barrett, 40 years of age and Juliana Farmer 57. We have a total of 9 victims who were treated. And are being treated at a university, the local hospital 3 which are in critical condition including our officer, three who are listed in non critical condition and three who have been treated and released. The two officers who struck an exchange of gunfire. One of the officers he was grazed to the left side and the other officers suffered minor injuries to the elbow. I just want to let everyone know that the officer who is in critical condition today, Officer Nicholas Wilt, 26 years of age, just graduated from the Police Academy on March 31st. I just swore him in and his family was there to witness his journey to become a police officer. He was struck in the head. Engaged in this incident, Nick has come out of brain surgery and is in critical but stable condition as we speak. I've been down there with the family and given my love and support, been with all the families today to show our love and support for them and if anything else that they need from LMPD. We will provide that the next few days are important and very critical. For Nicholas's recovery, this is will be a long complex investigation involving local, state and our federal partners. I'll be remiss if I did not acknowledge our federal partners who have just been just outstanding. Our local partners, ATFFBII, thank you. Our local partners, universal, local police, EMS, Emergency Management services. Thank you. Thank you for everything. And for my LMPD officers who took it upon themselves and not wait to assess everything, but just went in to stop the threat so that more lives would not be lost. Thank you. Thank you for showing up even when sometimes you are. Just felt like you're not appreciated. But I asked my officers when I addressed them today. If we don't do it, who will? And so they're very committed and their resiliency show today and their professionalism show today. I want to thank the governor. I want to thank the mayor who has been with us every step of the way through this trying and critical time. But I want to encourage the public. If you have any additional information, please call 574 LMPD and assist us. This should not continue to happen. Evil should not try to prevail and take over our city and we let it happen. So I'm encouraging everybody that we united and that we continue to do the good work and LMPD will continue to keep this Community and this city safe."

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me babe
Are you happy now

You're the only one, who can up and run, leave me just as empty as the day you came
You hold all the cards, all the broken hearts, strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain
And only you know the strength of your teeth
Wash in the weight of your pockets so deep
And lonely

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me be babe
Are you happy now
Are you happy now

In the palm of your hands, you can make me dance, spin me round in circles till I'm wrapped in string
You keep on talking sweet, till your fingers bleed, but don't you dare ask me how I've been
Now only you know the strength of your teeth
Wash in the weight of your pockets so deep
And lonely

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me babe
Are you happy now
Are you happy now

Ukraine War: What can the alleged leaked documents tell us?,"Philip Ingram, Former British Army Intelligence and Security Officer, has addressed secret documents disclosing the reinforcement of Ukraine's forces ahead of a new offensive against Russia which appear to have been leaked online.

He said the documents ""doctored the figures to Russian dead to 17,500 and the original document, if it is accurate itself, was significantly more than that"".

The US defence department is investigating who is responsible for the potentially damaging leak, which comprised screenshots of classified military documents posted on Twitter and Telegram.

Taylor is the mother of the six year old boy who police say shot his teacher, Abby's Warner. Taylor now faces felony child neglect and a misdemeanor charge. And Speracco is live in Newport News for us tonight with details on the indictment and then we're getting a lot of new information tonight. David Jana. Yeah, this is a big development, three months in the making with so many people nationwide just asking the question, who will be held responsible in this case? In addition to the six year old mothers, we are 6 year olds mother. We are now learning more people could possibly be charged in this case. It's an unprecedented case watched nationwide and months into the investigation we're learning more about who prosecutors are holding responsible. More than three months after Newport News police say a six year old boy shot his teacher, Abby Swerner, inside Ridge Neck Elementary School, a grand jury formally charged the boy's mother, 25 year old Deja Taylor. Newport News Calm Wells Attorney Howard Quinn says Taylor now faces charges of felony child neglect and recklessly leaving a loaded gun endangering a child after Newport News investigators say the boy took her 9 millimeter handgun and brought it to school in early January. Quinn told 13 News now his investigation showed the law does not support charging the child with aggravated assault. But he says this isn't the end to his investigation. Gwen is asking the court to appoint a special grand jury to look into security issues within the school that may have contributed to this incident. A spokeswoman for the school division confirmed the elementary school did not have metal detectors. And a school security officer was not on scene at the time of the shooting, Quinn says. Depending on the special grand juries and further investigation, more people, including Taylor, may face additional charges if the law supports it. In response to this latest development, Appy's Werners attorney Diane Tuscano sent us a statement saying in part. Today's announcement addresses but one of those failures. Our lawsuit makes clear that we believe the school division violated state law, and we are pursuing this in civil court. We will not allow school leaders to escape accountability for their role in this tragedy. And Abby's Werner's attorneys filed a lawsuit for $40 million in court last week. In that lawsuit, her attorneys claimed that school administrators ignored a vital warnings from school employees that the boy had a gun on him at school of the day of the shooting. Now, the attorney representing the now former principal of the school says they plan to file a countersuit. The assistant principal of the elementary school has since resigned from her position, reporting live in Newport News. I'm Annes Baraka for 13 news now. Deja Taylor's attorney, James Ellenson, released a statement this evening. He thanked the Commonwealth's attorney for sharing the news of the indictment. He said Taylor will turn herself in later this week."

while you weren't here. And I actually came across the video, 
10 years ago.
– I wasn't there, it wasn't me. You look very different,
TabarakAllah, MashaAllah. This fitness enthusiast has really helped, 
Mashaallah. You look to be different, 
I'm guessing you about 23 in this video 
that I'm going to show. – Okay. You're gonna find out, let's play the video. – Tom Finch this is your life. If these people were fasting 
I had to fast as well, AlhamduliLlah. I fasted the last week of Ramadan.
It was a start. After telling my mother 
that I was going to be a Muslim, she didn't look at me for almost a week. Before speaking with her,
I was happy that I found my religion. After the prayer, research and thought,
I invested to reach this decision. After seeing how upset my mother was, 
I began to doubt whether I was making 
the right decision. This was the woman who carried me 
in her womb for nine months and cared for me as a child 
and given me everything I ever need. As you guess, by this stage I was pretty upset. After speaking with a friend, I was back on track after establishing 
that the reasoning behind making 
this changes is for me. Pleasing my parents is important or pleasing my Creator
was ultimately importance. – Wow, wow, Allahu Akbar. – SubhanAllah. – Take us back to that moment, what was it like? – The first year. – The first year, coming to your parents and just saying, ""Look, you know 
this is what I've chosen"" – I guess what gets me a bit emotional,
I think the dynamic between me and my mother. My mother is an amazing woman, she's the most important person in my life. And she didn't receive the news 
particularly well, I think, in hindsight, she maybe understands it 
a bit better now, along with probably a few other people. It was very difficult for her, in particular the first few years. I think it actually took about three years
for us to pull together a relationship which was somewhat representative 
of what it used to be. My mother was like carry any excuse 
for a party Finch, like any Friday night she would be inviting 
my friends over for a party or a barbeque or a get-together,
I wouldn't even know about it. ""O, Finchy by the way,
I am coming to your party"" ""Okay, whatever you know, 
I'll see you there"" She's a machine. – What do you think you know,
didn't go to your advantage? – I'll tell you what did work. Grandkids. So when grandkids came,
that changed the game, you know. It's soften the hearts. What didn't work well?
– Yeah. – I think probably not sharing
more sooner with my mother. I think you know, bringing
someone along the journey. If someone's important to you 
and you really want to make 
like a address a serious problem that you have in your life, whether you know,
it's a mental health issue or iman or a faith issue or a health issue  
or whatever it is. If you're going to make a big change 
in your life, I think the wise approach 
is to you need a support team around you and you need to bring people on their journey. If you enjoyed this video

Try to hear!Jewish worship calls that are very similar to the Islamic Adhan,"Friends of faith.Israeli population adheres to Jewish religion.The essence of the belief of adherents of the Jewish religion is the form of God Nang Almighty.Same is the case of Islam, echoing the call to prayer for calls to perform prayers.Jews also have a way as a marker of worship calls.

So, what kind of marker of Jewish worship calls?At what time is the calling for worship is echoed?What is the difference between Muslims and Jews' calls?Check out the review by watching to the end, of course only on popular Islamic channels.

Hazard continues to broadcast hi hi hi. Maybe the Jewish call to prayer, the adhan, will be  a marker for carrying out worship for Muslims while the call to worship for Jews is called siomay and l which means listen to the people of Israel. The first and very important word shema is in the original Hebrew which means listen O people of Israel God is our God God is one through [Music] time of worship for Jews Muslims perform prayers five times a day Isha dawn midday asr and maghrib another for Jews who Israel is a prayer this is the title of the prayer that serves as the center of the Jewish prayer service Hi Jews recite the prayer  twice a day, namely in the morning and in the evening, it is said as a religious command. It is common for Jews to say Sheikh Mah as their last words. For parents to teach their children to say it before going to bed at night, yo, hi, different calls.  Muslim and Jewish worship time and the call to prayer begins with the words Allahu Akbar which is read twice. Each reading in the sentence of the call to prayer is chanted twice until it closes with the sentence Lailahaillallah. Meanwhile, try Israel, it starts with family and the same sentence Israel, which means listen, O people of Israel, then continues with  the following sentence which means Lord Our God, then continue with the following sentence, try only the lotu and the call to prayer which are repeated over and over again, the sentence in only Israel is also repeated. Hi and fellow believers, it is the Jewish people's event in carrying out their worship, of course they have difficulty distinguishing the call to worship. for Muslims and Jews because Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam did not pay attention to similarities with other people. Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said that those who resemble people other than us are not among us.

Why Doesn't MLS Have Promotion and Relegation?,"Perhaps one of the most unique aspects of Major League Soccer is the single entity structure. In essence, no team can be promoted or relegated from MLS in the traditional sense. Rather, new teams buy into the league, just as Minnesota and Atlanta United did earlier this year. In this video, we examine why MLS doesn't have a promotion/relegation system, and whether it's possible for the league to ever adopt this.

Major League Soccer is the single entity structure. In essence, no team can be promoted or relegated
from MLS in the traditional sense. Rather, new teams buy into the league, just
as Minnesota and Atlanta United did earlier this year. While single entity is very in-keeping with
American sports -- baseball, basketball, and NFL
all operate in this way -- it remains a contentious issue when it comes to soccer. As a nation, the US currently has three major
professional soccer leagues: MLS, NASL, and USL Pro. They are not linked in the traditional sense,
but they are classified as differing divisions. MLS is considered the first division, while
NASL and USL Pro share second division status, granted to them by the soccer
governing body. USL had previously been
considered division III, but this was changed in 2017 following a petition by the league. Although the US does not have promotion/relegation,
discourse on the matter remains intense. A study last year – commissioned by Silva
International Investments, whose head, Riccardo Silva, co-owns Miami FC in NASL – found
that 88% believe that “pro-rel” would boost American club soccer. Advocates for the introduction of pro-rel
suggest that not only would it aid sporting integrity,
but it would generate billions for the US soccer economy. A report from Deloitte released
around the same time as Silva International’s study claimed that reworking the soccer
pyramid to introduce promotion and relegation could stimulate changes that would benefit
the sport from top to bottom. “I do think that for the game to realise
its full potential in the US, promotion and relegation
feels like part of the solution,” said Dan Jones of Deloitte’s Sports Business Group. However, any change requires the agreement
of MLS, who currently accept new teams after a lengthy process of lobbying which includes
a detailed business plan. Although the
approach seems alien, it was a direct consequence of the landscape in the early 90s. MLS
was the by-product of the US’s 1994 World Cup bid, in which they committed to starting
a professional domestic league. The organisers of MLS, both in alignment with
domestic tradition and in order to generate financing, adopted the American closed-league
model, with a twist: rather than buying specific teams, investors would take a stake
in the league as a whole, which in turn controlled all the teams. Those same owners have subsidised the top
division in America for years on the understanding they were buying into a closed
system. Was this to change, their investments
would be unstable. Furthermore, few lower-division clubs have
the infrastructure to suddenly support top-level football, or even something
resembling that.​ NASL has attempted to rival MLS, but the league’s
financial instability has made that difficult to achieve, with Minnesota leaving to join
MLS and Ottawa and Tampa joining USL Pro. A report as recent as late July claimed MLS
spurned a $4billion media rights deal offered by
Silva which demanded the instillation of promotion-relegation. ""As was stated to [MP & Silva Group's founding
partner Riccardo] Silva both in person and in
a subsequent letter, Major League Soccer is prohibited contractually from engaging in
discussions about our media rights with other distributors,"" said Dan Courtemanche, MLS
executive vice president of communications.""We are not in a position, nor are we interested,
in engaging with Mr. Silva on his proposal."" That was followed by a joint proposal by Miami
FC and Kingston Stockade, a club based in northern New York, in which they filed a claim
with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to
require the US Soccer Federation (USSF) to adopt promotion and relegation across all
divisions in US soccer. The outcome of which is still to be decided. Although promotion relegation is not impossible
to implement in the US, it looks unlikely at
being adopted at the top level in the near future. The consequence of cultural and financial
situations, it will no doubt continue to cause discussion in soccer circles across the nation."

Biden dares Putin as U.S dispatches 'world's biggest' warship to patrol North Atlantic | Watch,"The U.S. Navy’s most advanced aircraft carrier has embarked on its first-ever deployment in the Atlantic Ocean to train with other NATO countries amid the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The deployment sends a clear message to Russia as U.S tries to secure the North Atlantic amid global tensions. The USS Gerald R. Ford began sailing the North Atlantic seas on Tuesday as the lead ship in a carrier strike group that includes six ships from NATO countries, several U.S. warships and a submarine. Among the nuclear-powered carrier's new technologies is the brand-new radar system that detect threats and the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for quick deployment of aircrafts.

China simulates mass missile strikes on Taiwan in show of strength - BBC News,"China has carried out mass simulated missile strikes on Taiwan, in military exercises that included “sealing off” the island. 

Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state. China sees it as a breakaway province that will eventually be brought under Beijing's control - by force, if necessary.

Beijing began the exercises after Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen met the US House Speaker in California, which China described as an act of “collusion” by the United States.

a way that makes you more alive and more joyful check it out wow okay um your job is is literally the stuff of horror movies right i mean they they make scary movies out of what you do they do and i don't i don't want to uh i don't want to give the devil too much attention because he's mr look at me and uh very much so right so we we could talk all about that and i'm sorry to disappoint if you're watching for that kind of thing but i i but supernatural things do happen they do and they're freaky right i'm you know i i have a friend who was part of an exorcism in haiti and this woman was cussing four guys out in their own native languages fluently and she never went to school from the mountains of haiti and i mean that's that's just one of like many really crazy uh stories right um is it scary uh well there's two parts of it the first is is that um the types of things that demons do are within a certain kind of a range or a gamut so okay you know after you've been in exercise for two to three years you've seen probably pretty much everything you're going to see right and it's not the devil's not very creative no in fact they're very consistent more so than we would think it seems random to us because we don't know their patterns sometimes but they're actually very consistent so you know the and the church has said these are the three kinds of things that you're going to watch for to give indication that the person is possessed for example and you do see those things people say well have you seen this from like you see in hollywood yeah i've seen all those things but they're not that common in fact those real extreme forms of prayer natural signs that you see probably only occur in about five to seven percent of the caseload you do see things that are pretty natural but not those you know like levitation and things like that those are those are fairly rare so very small percentage people come to you are actually possessed and then a very small percent of people who are possessed uh will levitate or speak other languages or do things that are like this is that's correct so the percentage we actually have statistics that we've been keeping track of the number of people that actually come to us that actually are possessed that that we first hear their initial story and begin the vetting process it's only point five percent so less than one percent of the people it doesn't mean they don't have other diabolic issues but it's less okay and as far as you know the scary part is is it's um because um demons work within a certain set of parameters the church has said look follow these rules and if you stay within your lane you're going to be safe it's when exorcists or priests get outside that that that's when the problems really began and so as long as you stay within that lane generally speak doesn't mean i mean it is stepping into a boxing ring of a sort but it's it's manageable it's not that difficult if you have a strong prayer life people say have you ever been afraid and always tell people to two times that was okay the first time which was thinking to myself i hope i don't do anything stupid right because it's it's your first time right in the driver's seat yeah uh the second time though it's funny because that's the same exact kind of fear that anybody has any new job yeah the second the second time was one time this one demon would not obey so i just turned to god the father mentally and i just said punish him in a way he's never been punished before and there was a full-blown freighter natural manifestation right there and he the demon was screaming and what what the did you say this out loud or just in your just in my own mind i said it i said it to god and so what happens is the the with the fear wasn't in relationship to the demons because they're not really to be feared because they're on a short leash it's what was what i was looking at is the severity of god's punishment for those who disobey him and don't um that reject him so that's what i've looked at i'm like if that doesn't strike the fear of god in you nothing will right literally looking this is what hell looks like so that there was that fear but the but it's really fallen out of style to even talk about that it very much is so it very much is so but but in relationship to the demons there is i there's an experienced exorcist doesn't have any fear he's cautious you have to be careful uh but you don't there's no fear because um they can only do what christ permits and so you know they're restricted and so you know as long as as long as i stay under christ's protection which is basically staying in the lane that the church has said to stay in you're not gonna you're you're not gonna uh you're not gonna suffer any faith yeah faith it's faith and fear don't coexist no they don't you know that that's exactly right yeah that's incredible uh that's really amazing wasn't that cool and by that i mean aren't i cool we know that i'm not but life to the fallen jesus is really cool so make sure you subscribe and never miss out on this great content that empowers you equips you to live life to the full [Music]

seems random to us because we don't know their patterns sometimes but they're actually very consistent so you know the and the church has said these are the three kinds of things that you're going to watch for to give indication that the person is possessed for example and you do see those things people say well have you seen this from like you see in hollywood yeah i've seen all those things but they're not that common in fact those real extreme forms of prayer natural signs that you see probably only occur in about five to seven percent of the caseload you do see things that are pretty natural but not those you know like levitation and things like that those are those are fairly rare so very small percentage people come to you are actually possessed and then a very small percent of people who are possessed uh will levitate or speak other languages or do things that are like this is that's correct so the percentage we actually have statistics that we've been keeping track of the number of people that actually come to us that actually are possessed that that we first hear their initial story and begin the vetting process it's only point five percent so less than one percent of the people it doesn't mean they don't have other diabolic issues but it's less okay and as far as you know the scary part is is it's um because um demons work within a certain set of parameters the church has said look follow these rules and if you stay within your lane you're going to be safe it's when exorcists or priests get outside that that that's when the problems really began and so as long as you stay within that lane generally speak doesn't mean i mean it is stepping into a boxing ring of a sort but it's it's manageable it's not that difficult if you have a strong prayer life people say have you ever been afraid and always tell people to two times that was okay the first time which was thinking to myself i hope i don't do anything stupid right because it's it's your first time right in the driver's seat yeah uh the second time though it's funny because that's the same exact kind of fear that anybody has any new job yeah the second the second time was one time this one demon would not obey so i just turned to god the father mentally and i just said punish him in a way he's never been punished before and there was a full-blown freighter natural manifestation right there and he the demon was screaming and what what the did you say this out loud or just in your just in my own mind i said it i said it to god and so what happens is the the with the fear wasn't in relationship to the demons because they're not really to be feared because they're on a short leash it's what was what i was looking at is the severity of god's punishment for those who disobey him and don't um that reject him so that's what i've looked at i'm like if that doesn't strike the fear of god in you nothing will right literally looking this is what hell looks like so that there was that fear but the but it's really fallen out of style to even talk about that it very much is so it very much is so but but in relationship to the demons there is i there's an experienced exorcist doesn't have any fear he's cautious you have to be careful uh but you don't there's no fear because um they can only do what christ permits and so you know they're restricted and so you know as long as as long as i stay under christ's protection which is basically staying in the lane that the church has said to stay in you're not gonna you're you're not gonna uh you're not gonna suffer any faith yeah faith it's faith and fear don't coexist no they don't you know that that's exactly right yeah that's incredible uh that's really amazing wasn't that cool and by that i mean aren't i cool we know that i'm not but life to the fallen jesus is really cool so make sure you subscribe and never miss out on this great content that empowers you equips you to live life to the full [Music]

The stolen car was my car which was stolen. Aipda DP, a member of the Pantai Cermin Police Station, was suspected of using a stolen car. This case was revealed after the victim was named Syahrizal, a resident of Jalan  Sukamaju, Percut Sei Tuan District, recognized the vehicle that had disappeared. The missing car was a Toyota Kijang Innova b2747ff. The victim's car disappeared when it was parked in front, apparently on Saturday 1 October 2022. After the incident, the victim went here and there to look for the whereabouts of the car, then on  At that time, a colleague told me that the missing car was being sold on the black market. I got photos and videos around October 4 2022, so in the video I don't know where it is because I only got photos and videos, so after I saw it, I was sure of it.  my car, said Syahrizal to the Medan Tribune, Friday 3 March 2023. I continued to search for the location. I got information that this was my car. It was at the police station in the Serdang Bedagai area. When I got this information, he tracked it down again and went to a number of police stations within the jurisdiction of the Police.  appreciate it first, I came to the Perbaungan Police Station, we checked, it turned out the photo location was different, finally I checked again at the Cermin Beach Police Station and when I arrived at the Cermin Beach Police Station, he saw that it was true that his car had been photographed at that location. After telling him, he also received information that the car was being used by police personnel. Pantai Cermin had the initials then I went to the Provos there and the DP contacted me, but he didn't admit that it was my car, he said. Long story short, in December 2022, he was summoned to the Hargai Police Station to discuss the matter. At that time he met directly with the Deputy Chief of Police, including Aipda DP Ia. said that at that time DS was being interpreted regarding the car. The beginning of the story was that DP was called by someone to meet and then they met at Simpang [ __ ] Anif. Initially the two people offered my car to DP but he said DP didn't have the money to pay then DP offered his Avanza car in exchange for the same.  the car was complete with all the documents, said the DP, the car wanted to find a buyer, explained that after the meeting at the police station, the price was not clear and the car had not been returned, said the DP, the car had not been sold, then it was returned to the two people who met him, then he said  Disgrace DB also revealed the characteristics of the perpetrator who was strongly suspected. One of them was that he knew the characteristics, he said he was one person, the name of the beach was indeed my family, he said, after hearing Disgrace DB's statement, he also suspected that the person who stole his car was his brother. It turned out that he had set the keys first and then took my car away.  Coincidentally, the vehicle registration was also in the car, as Syahrizal said, the car theft case was actually reported to the Medan Police on Friday 7 October 2022. He also hopes that the car will be returned soon and the police will immediately reveal the case and arrest the perpetrators, Head of Criminal Investigation Unit for the Medan Police, Police Commissioner Teguh Fathir  Mustafa said that his party had carried out an examination of Aida DP. From the results of the examination of the witnesses it could be concluded that the alleged perpetrator of the car theft was the younger brother of the victim with the initials i alias Pantai Fathir said that currently his party is still hunting for the perpetrator who is suspected to be the victim's younger brother and his whereabouts are not yet known.  We will look for his younger sibling until we can find out, but the police have not yet been able to determine whether Water and DP were also involved in the car theft or not."
Rare footage of former model held for “re-education” in China’s detention system - BBC News,"The BBC has obtained rare footage from inside China’s secretive system of mass incarceration in the far western region of Xinjiang. 

In a self-shot video a former fashion model, who is from the Uighur ethnic group, can be seen handcuffed to a bed. 

His relatives say he was taken away for what China has called re-education and that nothing has been heard from him since.

The Uighurs are Muslims from the Central Asian region.  Most of them — around 10 million people — live in China’s autonomous Xinjiang region. 

But up to 1 million have been detained in secure “educational training” centres where there is growing evidence of human rights abuses including forced labour and torture.

Neither the Chinese Foreign Ministry nor Xinjiang authorities have responded to the BBC’s requests for comment.

Why Puerto Rico is not a US state,"Nearly half of Americans don’t know that Puerto Ricans are US citizens. But they are, and have been since 1917.

As residents of the US Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Puerto Ricans have US passports, can travel freely throughout the country and can serve in the military. But that doesn’t mean the US citizens who live in Puerto Rico get the same rights and benefits as US citizens stateside.
 
Watch the video above to understand how Puerto Rico became a US commonwealth, the tangled relationship that developed, and how it all affects prosperity and development on the island today.

The people of Puerto Rico should have the right to determine their own
political future. When the people of Puerto Rico make a clear decision my
administration will stand by you. It may seem that US politicians support Puerto
Rico's right to decide its future and would even welcome Porto Rico as a US
state, but their words have yet to turn into action. This might not be surprising
considering that when Hurricane Maria hit the island, 46% of Americans didn't
know Puerto Ricans are American citizens. But they are. More Americans call Puerto
Rico home than 21 US states, but being a US citizen in Puerto Rico is not the
same as being a US citizen stateside. Puerto Rico is an American Commonwealth
and one of five inhabited US territories. The island became a US territory when
Spain conceded colonial control after it lost the Spanish-American war. The
federal government gave Puerto Ricans American citizenship, their own
Legislative Assembly, and governor. Like other American citizens Puerto Ricans
can serve in the US military and are subject to drafts. And like other
American citizens Puerto Ricans also pay most federal taxes. But unlike other citizens who face taxation, Puerto Ricans don't have federal representation. The island gets to send one politician to Congress to advocate on behalf of its
residents, but they don't have a vote. This means Puerto Ricans can't vote on
issues that affect the island such as limited funding for Medicaid or food
stamps, as well as a broader economic policy. And while Puerto Ricans on the
island can vote in the presidential primaries, they can't vote for the
president. Puerto Ricans have voted several times on their status and
referendums. Early on an ample majority of Puerto Ricans supported a
Commonwealth over statehood or independence. You don't want to be a state and you don't want to be independent, you just want to go on living in the
middle. In the middle, no. In the Commonwealth. Puerto Ricans today are divided on
the status of the island. The latest referendum shows large support for
statehood, but the turnout was historically low. But no matter what
polls and votes show, referendum results are non-binding, because Puerto Rico
can't become a state without approval from Congress and Congress has largely
ignored Puerto Rico's status, but as the island struggles to recover from
Hurricane Maria the issue is becoming harder to ignore. Puerto Rico's economy
started tanking when Congress phased out tax incentives designed to attract
investment to the island. Paired with fiscal mismanagement, the island's debt
started to grow. To reverse Puerto Rico's financial decline, a board appointed by
Congress imposed harsh austerity measures that reduced health and
education spending on the island. As opportunities lessen, Puerto Ricans are
relocating to mainland US. The population is shrinking on the island and their
political influence stateside is growing. Once permanently living in a US state
Puerto Ricans can actually impact federal politics. Puerto Rican statehood advocates
want five House Representatives and two Senators in Congress, while Commonwealth
supporters are fighting for increased parity without sacrificing their
national identity. But despite political efforts, it seems that Puerto Rico will continue to belong to the u.s. without really
having much of a say."

We know they were also going door to door asking for ring video, ring camera video things of that nature. But that one particular home in a camp Tabor Camp Taylor neighborhood was listed as an address for the shooter. Travis Breeze and photojournalist Paul Dunsford were there on the scene when police went inside the home. An LAPD SWAT team rolling up to the camp Taylor home of 25 year old Connor Sturgeon around 2:45 PM Monday. Officers knocked loudly. And entered with no resistance. And it scares you. You're afraid, you know, walk your dog or whatever. People living on Taylor Ave. reacting to the scene downtown and also trying to recall any previous exchanges with Sturgeon. He does look familiar. You never spoke to him or waved at him or anything. Not that I can remember to live next door to someone. I mean, I can't say nothing bad about the guy. Friendly. I was never scared or or afraid or had fear of them. They're very nice people. Era Alguire lives right next door to sturgeon and at least one roommate. We were able to speak with her as soon as police took down the crime scene tape. Never heard no kind of violence, never heard noise from him. Very respectful. Yeah, probably like your. Your favorite neighbor. According to News and Tribune in New Albany, Sturgeon was a Star Trek and basketball athlete at Floyd Central High School, and his dad was the coach for a time.

We know they were also going door to door asking for ring video, ring camera video things of that nature. But that one particular home in a camp Tabor Camp Taylor neighborhood was listed as an address for the shooter. Travis Breeze and photojournalist Paul Dunsford were there on the scene when police went inside the home. An LAPD SWAT team rolling up to the camp Taylor home of 25 year old Connor Sturgeon around 2:45 PM Monday. Officers knocked loudly. And entered with no resistance. And it scares you. You're afraid, you know, walk your dog or whatever. People living on Taylor Ave. reacting to the scene downtown and also trying to recall any previous exchanges with Sturgeon. He does look familiar. You never spoke to him or waved at him or anything. Not that I can remember to live next door to someone. I mean, I can't say nothing bad about the guy. Friendly. I was never scared or or afraid or had fear of them. They're very nice people. Era Alguire lives right next door to sturgeon and at least one roommate. We were able to speak with her as soon as police took down the crime scene tape. Never heard no kind of violence, never heard noise from him. Very respectful. Yeah, probably like your. Your favorite neighbor. According to News and Tribune in New Albany, Sturgeon was a Star Trek and basketball athlete at Floyd Central High School, and his dad was the coach for a time. We did see one person on the forensics team walking out with a laptop, but that officer would not confirm it was a piece of evidence.

Analysis: Russia now in a 'much worse military situation' with Finland joining NATO,"The Russian Federation says that it will strengthen military capacity in the west and north-west of the country in response to Finland joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

Security and defence analyst Professor Michael Clarke says the move is the biggest development in European military history since the remilitarisation of Germany in 1955.

The Russia military is now in a much worse situation he says, as 830 miles, or 1300 kilometres, have now been added to its borders with a NATO member.

Sweden has been neutral since 1812 and both of them now want to become members of NATO so and since 1945 the Finns have been very careful in the way they react to Russia they've played Russia very carefully um by not pushing the diplomacy too far uh trying to make sure that Russians were happy with everything they did that was the case all through the Cold War and now since 1991 finland's been much more independent and now they're so independent they think that they can join NATO how do you think the man we're looking at now Vladimir Putin is going to take this news well he pretends not to care but he cares very much because this has actually added another 830 odd miles uh 1300 kilometers of of NATO territory or NATO border with Russia so it means that any Russian leaders defense requirements are now a bit different it gives him something to to bother about and a bigger Frontier to worry about if he worries about these things but he pretends that it doesn't really matter they'll take whatever mean measures they need to take to counter it but actually there's not nothing the Russians can do and they don't have enough troops to be able to really pack this Frontier um because they're sending all of their available troops to Ukraine so this is I mean this is the biggest development in European security since the um the re-militarization of Germany in 1955 when Germany came into NATO as a re-militarized state after the second world war you know this is the biggest NATO enlargement the most importantly to enlargement since then and President Putin can say what he likes about it the fact is uh this is a a big diplomatic defeat for him which you know has produced exactly what he said this war was designed to prevent which was uh NATO enlargement well isn't one of the the reasons that he gave for the invasion of Ukraine the fact that NATO was on the Russian doorstep which it wasn't Ukraine was not a member of NATO and they kept saying it never will be even though it wants to be it will take a long time and now you've got the Finns joining up in Sweden sure to follow yeah exactly so it's me it's made Russia's security situation much worse than it was originally um and that's not going to change in the in the short term uh and the fact is that that um I mean Putin had several motives for this Ukrainian War but one of the motives he started to float as the war got closer was that this was all about pushing NATO back and telling NATO that it it can't keep taking on new members and remember that the new members of NATO were were this was all German driven NATO didn't want to enlarge itself it just was responding to requests very strong requests by the state in Europe that wanted to join NATO um and Putin sort of assumed that NATO was was behind all of this but it wasn't really it was just responding to demands from other other countries and so here we are now with a situation where NATO is bigger than it's ever been before stronger than it's been in many many years militarily and politically and Russia's in a situation where it can't do very much about that
Photos reveal Justice Clarence Thomas' luxury trips with GOP megadonor,"Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, have gone on several luxury trips involving travel subsidized by and stays at properties owned by a GOP megadonor, according to a new bombshell report published by ProPublica. #CNN #News",2023-04-06T19:01:10Z,UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw,News & Politics,249.0,459239,7992,0,4801,2023-11-07T11:08:55.641830,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSqvjjoVzEU/hqdefault.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society",TSqvjjoVzEU,"A brand new report is raising some serious questions about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and the lavish gifts that he reportedly accepted from a GOP megadonor ProPublica says that a luxury vacations from billionaire Harlan Crow were never disclosed. And according to these ProPublica, these are photos of Clarence Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, with Crow and others during a trip to Indonesia back in 2019. The report says that the Thomas flew on Crows private jet to Indonesia for the nine day luxury vacation. One that they say is valued at more than $500,000. Now ProPublica goes on to say that the extent and frequency of Crowe's apparent gifts to Thomas have no known precedent in the modern history of the United States Supreme Court. And just minutes ago, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin had this to say, quote, The ProPublica report is a call to action, and the Senate Judiciary Committee will act CNN Supreme Court reporter Ariane de Vogue is joining us now with more on this very eyebrow raising story. So, Arianna, how unprecedented is this really It's unheard of at the Supreme Court. This ProPublica report really detailing these lavish trips that Justice Clarence Thomas took and were paid for by this mega donor and trips, like you said, New Zealand, Indonesia on private jets, private yachts at private resorts. But what's really important here is to put this into context, because it comes as the Supreme Court right now is under this white-Hot spotlight, where more and more people are thinking that the court has becoming more political, less the judicial branch, more like just another political branch. And you see Congress right now, it's moving. It wants more ethics disclosure. He himself, Thomas, is arguably the most conservative member of the court. And, of course, his wife, Ginni Thomas, came under fire several months ago for texts that she sent to members of Trump's team in an effort to overturn election results. So this is all coming when the Supreme Court is in the middle of this swirling controversy. And it it causes trouble for Clarence Thomas and of course, what they're saying now is Harlan Crow, this Dallas businessman. He was the one who paid for this. It was never disclosed. And he is given more, according to ProPublica, than $10 million in political contributions over the years. Yeah, I mean, that's really stunning. So, Ari, on what has Harlan Crow said about all of this. Well, he did release a statement that we got a copy of. He said we have never asked about a pending or lower court case. And Justice Thomas has never discussed one. And we have never sought to influence Justice Thomas on any legal or political issue. He says he's unaware of any of our friends ever lobbying or seeking to influence Justice Thomas. But the thing is, it really does put a spotlight on ethics at the Supreme Court, because the judicial conference just recently amended its own rules, and it would cover things like staying in a private resort, private jets. It said that those things have to be disclosed. So maybe arguably, Thomas could say, look, before that, they didn't need to be disclosed. So I didn't have to disclose it. But there's also federal law in place. And it says that members of the judiciary should not accept anything of value from a person whose interests may be substantially affected. Again, language that might suggest that this kind of trip, this kind of money should have been disclosed. Now, Clarence, Thomas or neither Clarence Thomas or the Supreme Court has decided to give any kind of statement right now, but it comes as all eyes are on the Supreme Court. Yeah, absolutely. And as you said, the federal law talks about anything of value. These are a lot of very valuable things. I think most people would agree with that. Ari Devoe. Thank you very much."

Travis Breeze is here now with more on the shooters background and where the investigation stands. Travis. Doug at 3:00 o'clock this afternoon, we got the official death notice from the county coroner's office. Connor Sturgeon died from multiple gunshot wounds. LMPD officers were dispatched to Old National Bank at 8:38 and we just saw the body camera timeline saying that they entered the building and saw him down. At 8:45. Police released more information about the signs he gave prior to the shooting and what may have indicated that he had the potential and the desire to kill five people. We have also learned that he purchased the weapon used in this tragic incident on yesterday. On April the 4th. He purchased the weapon legally from one of the local dealerships here in Louisville. The headline Tuesday 25 year old Connor Sturgeon legally purchased an AR15 at one of the gun stores here in Louisville six days before walking into Old National Bank and killing five coworkers during a press conference Tuesday. Police confirmed they did obtain evidence while searching his house, but would not go into specifics. We have executed a search warrant on his residence and we have recovered items and we cannot get into specific details on what we recover at this time because again, the investigation is ongoing. The District Court office still does not have a public search warrant to share with WHS. The scene at Sturgeon's House was calm Tuesday, with neighbors telling us no one had gone in or out since the sweep. On Monday, New Albany, Floyd County Schools confirming that Connor Sturgeon was a 2016 graduate of Floyd Central High School and that his father, Todd, was the basketball coach for a time. We know this shooter purchased an AR15 rifle on April 4th. We know he left a note. We know he texted or called at least one person to let them know he was suicidal and contemplating harm. Mr. Sturgeon, being an employee at the bank, there is some level of tie between the two parties, but we're still waiting for a clear motive to be given by law enforcement. Also waiting to see if the county coroner or the state medical examiner have any additional information to release in this case. Doug."

*Loyal lyrics*
Loyalty is blocking
I moved to another heart
And don't want me to hurt
Craving this love only with you
But the kudrat is not in my hand

To you, my longing for my longs
Unfortunately so sad
Leave Lara break up my love

At the end of the Pilu Meeting
You know you leave me
You are annoyed waiting for you
Mistakes You Turn on My Soul
You show your arrogance
I related this unholy love.

I Haykan Falls
Achieving Holy Love
Hope there is a noble human being

In line of missing
Disappear so sad
Leave Lara break up my love

At the end of the Pilu Meeting
You know you leave me
You are annoyed waiting for you
Mistakes You Turn on My Soul
You show your arrogance
You don't appreciate this self

You're in the truth in my soul
You look your ambiguity
I Redhai This Into Into LOVE goes far away
I love
The best

from the 1990s, there’s really one big difference in their designs. The ones from the 70s are boxy, and the ones
from the 90s are curvy. For some car models, you can even tell the
exact year when that change happened. Just look at this commercial for the Buick
LeSabre, showing the 1991 model — and then the 1992 model. See the curves? Let’s watch that again. ‘91 is boxy, sharp edges. ‘92? Smooth and round. Since then, cars have become curvier and curvier. So how did this happen? When manufacturers started making curvy cars
in the 90s, it wasn’t a totally new concept. Back in the 1930s, streamliners like this Chrysler
Airflow used this sleek design to reduce wind resistance. But as the 50s and 60s rolled around, American
streamliners stopped selling well — they were outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Gas prices were on fairly steady decline at
this point, so streamlining for fuel efficiency was less of a concern. Well into the 1970s, just about every car
made in America had sharp edges and very few curves. They were basically designed as a series of
three boxes — the hood, the cabin, and the trunk. That model worked really well in the US market. But in Europe, fuel was always more expensive. In the 60s, a gallon of gas in France cost
a whopping 73.1 cents while it was just 31 cents in the US. So European designers started experimenting
with more aerodynamic designs to help cars move more easily so they’d waste less gas. Automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz
— they all started rolling out car models that had curved exteriors. Eventually American automakers started to
copy the European aerodynamic look to try to attract upscale consumers. The mass market was a different picture. In Europe, a designer named Uwe Bahnsen was
the first person to push for a curved design for the average driver, and he did that with
the 1982 Ford Sierra. It was curvier than any car in its class at
the time. But critics just laughed at it. And it didn't sell very well at first. It was nicknamed the “jelly mould” because
of how much it looked like the kind of circular shape you’d make JELL-O with. But one of the designers from that European
Ford design team — this guy, Jack Telnack — took over the US design team in 1980. American gas prices at this point were skyrocketing
due to conflict in the middle east. So Telnack brought wind tunnel testing into
the design process. He first did that with the 1983 Ford Thunderbird. But the real breakthrough came a few years
later: ""The result was the groundbreaking 1986 Ford
Taurus."" It might not look that groundbreaking now,
but this style was revolutionary at the time. It was a mass market car with curvy edges
— and people liked it. “Taurus! Now a North American car with a shape and
a feel we’ve never seen before… Taurus for us!” They used it in RoboCop as the car of the
future. The sales basically saved Ford, which had
really been struggling at the time, and it inspired a whole wave of copycat curvy cars. And streamlining became even more popular
because manufacturers were facing new fuel economy regulations in the US. Starting in 1978, the average fuel efficiency
of each manufacturer’s passenger cars had to meet higher and higher levels. According to one Ford designer, aerodynamic
design was a much more affordable way to boost efficiency than doing engineering work under
the hood. The rise of computer modelling in the 80s
also made it easier for car makers to design and manufacture curved lines. All these years later, the influence on today’s
cars is pretty clear. Even the models that we criticize for being
ridiculously boxy these days — like the Scion xB — are actually really round. And if our modern day sci fi movies have anything
to say about it, that won’t be changing anytime soon."
